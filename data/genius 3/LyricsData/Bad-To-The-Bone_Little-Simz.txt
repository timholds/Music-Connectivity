[Refrain: Bibi Bourelly]
Simmer down, simmer down
Give me cake, give me loud
Give me more, give me dope
Give me now, give me now
Got a boy from the Southside
Or should I say he got me
Man a nigga got me

[Hook: Little Simz]
Bad to the bone
Man that's all I've ever known
You can tell that I'm bad to the, bad to the bone
Man that's all I've ever known
You can tell that I'm bad to the, bad to the bone
Man that's all I've ever known
You can tell that I'm bad to the, bad to the bone
Man that's all I've ever known

[Verse 1: Bibi Bourelly]
Three-one-two, zero-three-zero
We the in the three-two-three
Cali life, hot
Short shorts, you can touch what you see
He ain't never met a chick chick that can pen like me
I ain't never met a man that can do me right like him
He call me foreign cause I'm overseas
Take that nigga overseas
Cali life
Short shorts, you can touch what you see

[Verse 2: Little Simz]
Been hot from '06
Doing bout 100 on the A406
Who you came here for, oh shit
Not them
Playing with fire might get you burned, be too late 'fore you notice
Been the truth, and you should already know this
Rabbit holes never been for the slow kids
I was one of them at one point, real shit
Oh man, look at my stance, confidence high when they criticise my art
Ah nah boy, you don't wanna be in my heart
Ah nah shit's cold sometimes
I have to remind niggas fuck I are
Who the fuck I are
Info sometimes, it's needed so niggas know how to play they part
We can take it there but it may be way too dark

[Hook: Little Simz]
Bad to the bone
Man that's all I've ever known
You can tell that I'm bad to the, bad to the bone
Man that's all I've ever known
You can tell that I'm bad to the, bad to the bone
Man that's all I've ever known
You can tell that I'm bad to the, bad to the bone
Man that's all I've ever known

[Verse 3: Little Simz]
N5, tomfoolery ain't what it ends like
Got a boy straight from the N side, he on the low sometimes
Got the gas, he wanna, bill it wanna blow sometimes
Wanna kick it when I'm all alone sometimes
Boy your company is all I know sometimes, but I just want to be here on my own sometimes
Ah, don't get offended I'ma phone sometime
Might hit you up at a dumb time, you should know what's up
I'm a busy girl
Keep it on the low, none of that kissing and tell shit
I'm open and selfless
Come on

[Refrain: Bibi Bourelly]
Simmer down, simmer down
Give me cake, give me loud
Give me more, give me dope
Give me now, give me now
Got a boy from the Southside
Or should I say he got me
Man a nigga got me

[Verse: 4 Little Simz]
Plus four-four
Three-three, straight to the five-o-six
On the flight high, tired as shit
Plane lands and I'm out quick
He ain' never met a chick, chick on some real G shit
I ain't never met a man that can do me quite like him

[Hook: Little Simz]
He can tell I'm bad to the, bad to the bone
Man that's all I've ever known
You can tell that I'm bad to the, bad to the bone
Man that's all I've ever known
You can tell that I'm
