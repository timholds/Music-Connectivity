Witten and Recorded by Hank Snow

(A) Linda Lou, honest true
I’m just wild about your lovely eyes of (E7) blue
For your smile, I’d walk miles
For my honey child I’m glad to be with (A) you

(A) As long as you are by my side I (D) have no cause to pine
I (B7) point you out with so much pride
And (E7) tell the world you're mine
Linda (A) Lou , honest true
I’m in (B7) love with you a-(E7) lone sweet Linda (A) Lou

(A) I’ve waited a (D) long time for you (A) darlin'
But (E7) never knew exactly what you’d (A) be
Now that you have (D) come to me my (A) darlin'
You ‘re a (B7) wee bit of heaven to (E7) me;

Linda (A) Lou, honest true
You’re the first in every thought I have to-(E7) day
You’re so sweet, and so neat 
That I thank the LORD for sending you my (A)way

Some day you’ll know the way I feel deep (D) down within your heart 
To (B7) be with you when shadows steal and (E7) know we’ll never part 
Linda (A) Lou , honest true
I’m in (B7) love with you a- (E7) lone sweet Linda (A) Lou
