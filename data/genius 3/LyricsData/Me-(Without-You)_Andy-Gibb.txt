Without you , stood alone on the edge of time
Out of sight,but forever mine, without you
Sometime's there's no forgetting the night
When you reach for the stars ,just to be where it's bright
But you left me behind , what a crazy goodbye

Without you, there ain't no love at all
And without you , there ain't no plans at all
Without you , ev'rything's lost to the wind
You were the love I was in
How can I try to be me
Without you

Without you, watching you take the world from me
Leaving me with a memory about you
Sometime's there's no forgetting the place
Where you told me goodbye ,like a slap in the face
Where you tore me apart and I learned how to cry

Without you , there ain't no love at all
And without you , there ain't no plans at all
Without you , ev'rything's lost to the wind
You were the love I was in
How can I try to be me

Without you , there ain't no love at all
Without you baby, there ain't no plans at all
Girl, without you , ev'rything's lost to the wind
You were the love I was in
How can I try to be me, me
Without you , without you honey , ah...
Without you , ev'rything's lost ...
