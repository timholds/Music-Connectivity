[Verse 1]
She only lies
Just to save my feelings
I cry, despite
Just to make a feeling
Hold inside
Guilt, that isn't really healing
Fried a lie
Just to burn my eyes

Ohhh
Ohh

[Verse 2]
She only lies
Just to save my feelings
I only cry
Just to make her feel guilty
I cry, despite
Just to save my reasons
I know it's right
And I want her to die
I don't love her
No, I really hate her
And I know that you will hate her too
If you are givin' her half a chance at all
