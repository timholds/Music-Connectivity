OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH

Where did you come from? Where have you been?
It looks like you fell into a trash bin
I'm catching the train! I'm crashing the car!
I'm packing for daylight! Shooting for the stars!

Like a lifelong Daisy-Chain
Of my imagination
Rat inside a maze
I got no destination
Because i'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again, i'll tell you the same
Little Boy Named Train
I don't know where i come from
But i know where i have been

Serious people are funny to me
Funny People seem so serious
I'm always lost and nothing'll change
Give me directions and i'll get lost again

Like a lifelong Daisy-Chain
Of my imagination
Rat inside a maze
I got no destination
Because i'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again, i'll tell you the same
Little Boy Named Train
I don't know where i come from
But i know where i have been
SAY!

Like a lifelong Daisy-Chain
Of my imagination
Rat inside a maze
I got no destination
Because i'm a little boy named Train
Ask me again, i'll tell you the same
Little Boy Named Train
I don't know where i come from
But i know where i have been
I said i don't know where i come from
But i know where i have been
