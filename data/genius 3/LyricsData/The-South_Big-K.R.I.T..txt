Bitch I'm from the south
Where the old schools swang and the trunk's on bang
Bitch I'm from the south
Where the girls come big, gettin' money ain't shit
Bitch I'm from the south
Where the doors fold up, gripped grain get bumped
Bitch I'm from the south
Choppin' on blades, jammin' screw tapes

[Verse 1:]
Okay, I'm back on the throne, wrist full of stones
Just touched down and I'm still on chrome
Pimp by blood, shawdy show me love
The lames over there come fuck with us
She down for the cuttin', all night suckin'
Bread beat charge, so the law can't touch me
Mouthpiece killa, ain't nothin' trilla
Than an old school Chevy Santonas Godzilla

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Okay, I got a little money, made a little bread
Trick on the whip, now I get a lot of head
My swag got legs, runnin' on haters
Where you goin' so fast? Okay, I'm headed to the paper
Suicide doors, inside murder
A nerd with the herb only roll with Urkel
No square my circle, king of my hill
Your nigga ain't me, shawdy tell me how it feel

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
For all my country ass niggas, that know what I'm about
The chicks in the hood with the grills in they mouth
The independent women, the hardworkin' pimps
The broad that gave it all in the club where she strip
The nigga that whip, the boy lockdown
The educated brothers, my phone gun to ground
The whole third coast, I do it for the world
Every man, woman, boy, little girl
That know about the south
