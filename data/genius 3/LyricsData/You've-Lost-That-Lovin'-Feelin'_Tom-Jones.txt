You never close your eyes anymore when I kiss your lips
And there's no tenderness like before in your fingertips
You're trying hard not to show it
But baby, baby, I know it

You've lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa

Now there's no welcome look in your eyes when I reach for you
And girl, you're starting to criticize little things I do
Oh, it makes me just feel like crying
'Cause baby, something beautiful is dying

You've lost that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
You've lost that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, whoa

Baby, baby, I get down on my knees for you
If you would only love me like you used to do, whoa
We had a love, a love, a love you don't find everyday
So don't, don't, don't, don't throw it away, oh

Bring back that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone

Bring back that lovin' feeling
Whoa, that lovin' feeling
Bring back that lovin' feeling
Now it's gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
Bring back that lovin' feeling
