Lonely am I, only my thoughts crowd the room
Why can't I cry

Time passes me by, the cold touch of dawn tells me so
Still I can't cry

You promised to love me and vowed you'd never leave me alone
With a broken heart
You treated our love like a game, tortured my mind, the pain
That some day you'd go

Flames in the fire can't warm the chill of my room
Why can't I cry
Feel I want to die, just how much more can I take
If I can't cry

You promised to love me and vowed you'd never leave me alone
With a broken heart
You treated our love like a game, tortured my mind, with the pain
That some day you'd go

I multiply, all of the hours you've been gone
Still I can't cry, lonely am I
Why can't I cry
