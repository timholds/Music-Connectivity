[Chorus]
Gemini, won't you meet me eye to eye?
I've been wondering why you keep feeding me these lines
And you made a fool of me
Yeah you made a fool of me
As you sang me sweet

[Verse 1: Lyndsey Gunnulfsen]
You charm me, it's not easy
You would not believe how the tides have turned
You think I would have learned this by now
If I'm gonna play your games, I know there's a price to pay
I've got the tendency to constantly pay for my mistakes

[Hook]
Gemini, when you come out at night
My head spins and I cave in and I can't pick sides

[Chorus]
Gemini, won't you meet me eye to eye
I've been wondering why you keep feeding me these lines
Gemini, yeah as you can see
Why you had your way with me
(You made a fool of me)

[Verse 2: Lyndsey Gunnulfsen]
You would not believe
You would not believe
All the things I've seen

[Verse 3: Lyndsey Gunnulfsen]
If I'm gonna lost this game, what's the use in trying to play?
I shouldn't expect any less but I can't always have my way
Gemini, when you come out at night
My head spins and I cave in and I can't pick sides

[Chorus]
Gemini, won't you meet me eye to eye
I've been wondering why you keep feeding me these lines
Gemini, yeah as you can see
Why you had your way with me
(You made a fool of me)

[Verse 4: Kyle Anthony:]
You've got your hooks in my back, I feel their cold sting
You've got me strung out like a puppet while you pull on these strings
You would not believe the things I've seen
You would not believe the things I've seen

[Chorus]
Gemini, won't you meet me eye to eye
I've been wondering why you keep feeding me these lines
Gemini
Yeah as you can see
Why you had your way with me
(You made a fool of me)
