I remember the dreamwind
Filling my sails then blowing me off course

I remember the blue sky
The follies of youth and a wish to die

I remember things held close
Thrown away and forgotten

I foresee that it will come true
This my wind now blows for you

Calling calling
Across the blue

I remember the black heart
The knowledge of age and the falling apart

I remember the feelings I lack
And the friendships that were a stab in the back

Calling calling
Across the blue

I will burn this page today
I will throw my life away
I just do not want to stay
I give it all to the beautiful sea

Calling calling
Across the blue

Calling calling
Across the blue

To the distant grey
