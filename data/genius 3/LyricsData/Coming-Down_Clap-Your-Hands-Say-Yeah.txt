Lift me up ‘til, I don’t know, how did you put it?
My false romance of obnoxiousness dressed up as innocence in passing
With imitations and sell-outs
In a solitary glance see something better when I know
So many people here
Who would offer their middle finger on a promenade in a comedy between idle thumbs

You gave me something to remember, you said
Go it alone, Go it alone
And I’ve been goin' it alone
All the while
Go it alone, Go it alone
And as I reach for the binoculars
You go for the jugular

[Chorus]
Didn’t anybody see your face
Didn’t anybody wonder how you
Carry the weight of the world inside your mouth
And I would never try to get away and
I can’t think of another reason why
It’s the way that it is
Just stay right there you know I’m coming down

So you tell me you have news
And then you tell me more bad news
And how’d you put it?
Oh my god man, Oh it got me sudden
Still my credit is no good here
Holding plastic chips in an airport pharmacy before a red eye
This song written in a pigsty
Dedicated to your smile

[Chorus]
Didn’t anybody see your face
Didn’t anybody wonder how you
Carry the weight of the world inside your mouth
And I would never try to get away and
I can’t think of another reason why
It’s the way that it is
Just stay right there you know I’m coming down
