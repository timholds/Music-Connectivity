I effect to your dreams
Destiny written with blood
Eyes shut unseen
Hands held tight to your throat

Purity in dying - breath starts to fade
Murderer cries - as you die no one is safe

I show you signs
What have been what will be
The meaning of life
Never told - hands on your throat

Struggle - murder - breaking neck
Eyes bleed you get no breath

No point struggling from chokehold

Choke

Victim of random violence
Again another life
All seems so pointless
Memories flash goodbye

Inhale - exhale - words in your mind
Praying - mercy - resistance is a lie
