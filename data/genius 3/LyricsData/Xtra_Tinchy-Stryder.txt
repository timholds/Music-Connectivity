In grime they can call me the golden boy
Promise you there ain't no holding boy
I'm not folding boy
Run up on kicks on some James Bond shit with a golden toy
And they're like
Shifty bomaye
That's what they're gonna shout, bomaye
All day, every day, bomaye
We deal with them and I bomaye
Boom bam
See me in the rave with the gang, boom bam
Free roach out of the can, boom bam
Reach for the ting, boom, boom, boom
Nuff shots like a blam
Cah, I'm a dan, hotter than, ratter than
Manner than a Taliban in Afghanistan
Never for a niggas that shoot like camerman
Never stay in one place, move like caravan, yo
I bun through like a mash man
Don't do cheques, want cash man
Man I'll skin off the hair of your tash man
Man a Dirty's known as a gash man
I be like easy, man
My name is Fuda, man
You think I'm easy, man
I know the mash man who clap back and blam
Your girl knows me, man
Definitely phones me, man
Wants to roll with your hand but
I swear down, man, all these girls on my phoneline
Definitely slows me
Down, down, down, down, down
You know me I'm down, down, down, down, down, down
Bring the war when I'm down, down
