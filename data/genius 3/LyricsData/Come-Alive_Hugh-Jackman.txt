[Verse 1: P.T. Barnum]
You stumble through your days
Got your head hung low
Your skies' a shade of grey
Like a zombie in a maze
You're asleep inside
But you can shake awake

[Pre-Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
'Cause you're just a dead man walking
Thinking that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blinding
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind
You'll never be the same

[Pre-Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reaching up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified

[Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were living in
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
So, come alive!

[Verse 2: P.T. Barnum]
I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie
That you need to hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door
But don't you stay that way

[Lettie Lutz]
No more living in those shadows
You and me, we know how that goes

[Lord of Leeds]
'Cause once you see it, oh you'll never, never be the same

[Both]
We will be the light that's turning
Bottle up but keep on shining

[All]
You can prove there's more to you

[P.T. Barnum]
You cannot be afraid

[Pre-Chorus: Ensemble]
Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light
Let it burn so bright
Reaching up
To the sky
And it's open wide
You're electrified

[Chorus: Ensemble]
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
So, come alive!

[Ensemble]
Come one!
Come all!
Come in!
Come on!

[Anne Wheeler]
To anyone who's bursting with a dream

[Ensemble]
Come one!
Come all!
You hear
The call

[P.T. Barnum]
To anyone who's searching for a way to break free

[Ensemble]
Break free!
Break free!

[Chorus: Ensemble and P.T. Barnum]
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open
(Hey!)

[Chorus: Ensemble and P.T. Barnum]
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreaming with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't be go back again
To the world that we were living in
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open

[Outro: Ensemble and P.T. Barnum]
'Cause we're dreaming with our eyes wide open

So come alive! (Come alive!)
