[Chorus]
They still play country music in Texas
Some things in life you just don’t mess with
While the world’s off chasing the next big thing
All caught up in the winds of change
They still play country music in Texas

[Verse 1]
I turn on the radio they’re mixing heavy metal with twang
People on TV doing anything for fame
I’m not one to cling to the past
But some of this new stuff burns my ass
Thank God and Willie some things stay the same

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
In Nashville They’re taking off their cowboy hats
Playing round with hip hop putting on cock-eyed caps
It crawls up under my tired blue collar
When it’s done for nothing but the almighty dollar
I need a cold beer play me a fiddling song

[Chorus][x3]
