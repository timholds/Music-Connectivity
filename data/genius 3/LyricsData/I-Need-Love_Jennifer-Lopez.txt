[Verse 1]
This is where my story begins
Standing here with you, I'm about to give in
And I'ma give all I can give
Even though in previous relationships
I might have been mischievous
I wasn't already ready, I admit to this
But what a good feeling it is
I've had a lot of crushes, close to nothing like this

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Everytime the subject would come
I made up every excuse that I could think of
I used to run but now I'm getting warmed up
In a few words, this feeling, I could sum up

[Chorus]
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Want to cuddle up to something
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Want to cuddle up to something
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting, I need

[Verse 2]
I was hanging out with my friends
Seven nights a week, if there's a party, I'm in
I started getting sick of it
But when I looked back I didn't know what it meant
I guess I wasn't interested in finding something real
Though I was looking for it
You should've been looking for me
But you opened up my eyes, and now I can see

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And every time the subject would come up
When they say "I love you", then I only dumb up
A lot of guys, a girl or shut up
But you're the only guy that told me your love was endless
A lot of words with feeling can not sum up
But first, I had to figure out who I was
To try and understand that there is no shortcuts
Now the only thing that's missing is your love

[Chorus]
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Want to cuddle up to something
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Want to cuddle up to something
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting, I need

[Refrain]
Slow dance, hold hands
All I want is romance
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance
Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give; baby, don't you hear me?
Slow dance, hold hands
All I want is romance
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance
Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give; baby, don't you hear me?

[Chorus]
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Want to cuddle up to something
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Want to cuddle up to something
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Want to cuddle up to something
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting, I need

[Refrain]
Slow dance, hold hands
All I want is romance
If it's real, let me know it's real, baby, take a chance
Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me
And I got a lot of love to give; baby, don't you hear me?
