[Verse 1]
I gave it all away that night, it was taking a little time, oh
I gave it all I got but now you better know that I know for sure, oh

[Refrain]
You made my bed, dealt with it when the lights went out
Now looking back for temporary nothings
But I bet on it, you'll all be here when the lights come out
Still looking for nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave it all I got to know now
I don't want no part of it no longer, no longer
Looked around this place enough to know now
I don't want to waste the time to know you, to know you

[Chorus]
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me

[Verse 2]
Now, I don't want to bite the hand that'll show me the other side, no
But I didn't want to build the land that has fed you your whole life, no
Don't you find it funny?

[Refrain]
You made my bed, dealt with it when the lights went out
Now looking back for temporary nothings
But I bet on it, you'll all be here when the lights come out
Still looking for nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
I gave it all I got to know now
I don't want no part of it no longer, no longer
Looked around this place enough to know now
I don't want to waste the time to know you, to know you

[Chorus]
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me

[Bridge]
I don't wanna, wanna, wanna wait
I don't wanna, wanna, wanna wait

[Chorus]
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
Don't you wait for me
