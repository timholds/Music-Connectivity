Transform a drop buttons transform the top

Shoot it right back ova' wata'
No bring your patna, tell her go network

[Mayne Mannish]
Yeah I'm a self-driven nigga no need for brakes
You see the candy paint lac no need to chase
With a G up in your face probably bustin' your face
Any race they can get it man its far from the fake
Been known from rockin' mics respected in 0-4
My team they know whats up them others they close doors
I'll take ya to a place you never tried to go
Berkeley, Waterfront where niggas is gettin' dough
You never seen a young playa like Mayne
Cocky in his own way, he's far from being lame
No games the bay shall be changed
From niggas who stepped up whos known as The Team
You start from the bottom reach the top
Most Niggas they start from the bottom yet they drop
Reach forward ma clean ya act up
The 4 fifth conceal for niggas who act up
