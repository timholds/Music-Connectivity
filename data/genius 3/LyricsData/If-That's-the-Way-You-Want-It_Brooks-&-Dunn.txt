[Verse 1]
I've loved you since I met you
I guess I always will
There's something 'bout the way you smile
That makes my heart stand still
You say you love your freedom
I'd never tie you down
If you ever need these loving arms
I'll be hanging around

[Chorus]
If that's the way you want it
That's alright with me
If that's the way you want it
That's how it's going to be
I'll be your Johnnie on the spot
Or Mr. Used To Be
If that's the way you want it
That's alright with me

[Verse 2]
I'm laid back, easy-going
I'm not the jealous kind
I won't get in your business
If you won't mess with mine
Just say the word forever
I'll gladly sing that line
I'll lay the world down at your feet
And fly you to the moon

[Chorus]
