[Verse 1]
I pulled out of Los Angeles at two a.m
Nothin' on the radio, mariachi band fadin' out and in
Blacktop in my headlights looks like it has no end
Only thing on my mind is gettin' back to my baby again

[Chorus]
How far to Waco
Two hundred miles to New Mexico
Albuquerque by mornin' light
Six hours to the Texas line
Highway miles, they go by so slow
She's waitin' down the road from El Paso
How much further do I have to go
How far to Waco

[Verse 2]
Stopped at a Tucson truck stop, Coke and a candy bar
Paid for the gas with the last of my cash, got back in the car
I can't wait to hold you, my darlin', in my arms
Going back to the love of that pretty girl that owns my heart

[Chorus]
How far to Waco
Two hundred miles to New Mexico
Albuquerque by mornin' light
Six hours to the Texas line
Highway miles, they go by so slow
She's waitin' down the road from El Paso
How much further do I have to go
How far to Waco

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
How far to Waco
Two hundred miles to New Mexico
Albuquerque by mornin' light
Six hours to the Texas line
Highway miles, they go by so slow
She's waitin' down the road from El Paso
How much further do I have to go
How far to Waco

[Outro]
How much further do I have to go
How far from Waco
