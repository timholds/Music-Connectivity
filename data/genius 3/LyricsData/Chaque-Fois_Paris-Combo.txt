In a dance-hall one evening, where I ended up by chance
Attracted like a vulgar little moth by the Chinese lanterns
You were in your element, making a spectacle of yourself
I was there incognito and you did your number on me...
CHORUS
Oh, I would have happily thrown it all in, happily told you where to get off
You and your laminated tuxedo and your slicked-back blow-dry
But no, I cannot, (yes but no), very well dance without you
With all the others, with every step, each time I fell for it:
But with you, each time, with every step, each time I danced, and it was not easily forgotten
You put your hands on my waist and suddenly
I felt my disdain evaporate almost with regret
It’s your ridiculous look that touched me I think
And my acid-like glance failed to have the "drop dead" effect!
CHORUS
I have my own ideas about love…and you don’t really fit in
But if I embrace your form I forget about the whys and the wherefores
