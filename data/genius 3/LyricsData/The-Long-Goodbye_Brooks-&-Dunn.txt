[Verse 1]
I know they say if you love somebody, you should set them free
But it sure is hard to do, it sure is hard to do
I know they say if you don't come back again, then it's meant to be (So they say)
Those words don't pull me through, 'cause I'm still in love with you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I spend each day here waitin' for a miracle
But it's just you and me goin' through the mill, climbin' up a hill

[Chorus]
This is a long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breakin' a heart
No matter how hard I try
I always make you cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happenin' here is a long goodbye

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I ask my heart did we really, give our love a chance (Just one more chance)
But I know without a doubt, we turned it inside out
And if we walked away would it make more sense
But it tears me up inside, just to think we could still try

[Pre-Chorus 2]
How long must we keep runnin' on a carousel
Goin' 'round and 'round and never gettin' anywhere, on a wing and prayer

[Chorus]
This is the long goodbye
Somebody tell me why
Two lovers in love can't make it
Just what kind of love keeps breakin' a heart
No matter how hard I try
I always make you cry
Come on, baby, it's over, let's face it
All that's happenin' here is a long goodbye

[Outro]
Long goodbye
Long goodbye
