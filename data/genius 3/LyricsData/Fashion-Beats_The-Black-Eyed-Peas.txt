[Verse 1 - will.i.am]
Hey doctor, is something wrong with me?
Am I crazy do I need a remedy?
I'm a, club rocker that's my personality
It's in fashion to be bla-blasting them beats
And I like to go out every night
I like to go out every night
I like to go out every night
I like to go out and... Yeah

[Hook 1 - will.i.am + Fergie]
Dance dance to them beats beats beats (to the beat)
Dance dance to them beats beats beats (to the beat)
Dance dance to them beats beats beats (to the beat)
Rock rock to the beats beats beats (to the beat)

[Hook 2 - Fergie]
Get ready for the night, woah !
Party people just keep on rocking
Get ready for the night, woah !
Party people just keep on rocking
