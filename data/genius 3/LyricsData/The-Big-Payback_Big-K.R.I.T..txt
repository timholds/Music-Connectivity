[Hook:]
This the Big Payback!
The only king, that's remembered in time
This for them lames tryin' to block my shine
This the big payback!
The Chevy with the chrome wheels
I did it for them haters for real
This the big payback!
For the mothefuckas thought I would fall
I roll ‘em up, burn ‘em down and break 'em off
This the big payback!
They tried to leave a nigga for dead
But I survived underground and got bread
This the big payback!

[Verse 1:]
Now, I ain’t trippin' on no critics or no bloggas
Now, I ain’t trippin' on no critics or no bloggas
Now, I ain’t trippin' on no critics or no bloggas
But they don’t know the pressure of an artist
To be the hardest rapper alive
Most rappers would die to see a microphone rating over 5
[Fo real] or grace the cover
That type of look'll make you slap your partner's baby mother
Settle down with your girl, break her off without a rubba
See, they tried to count me out 'cuz I was country
Wouldn’t listen to my records 'cuz my name sound funny
[What's K.R.I.T?]
They think its jiggaboo, why would I mister you?
You don’t see them dots?
It’s an acronym bitch, I thought you knew!
But they tried to get me riled up
Fourth quater, fifth personal, they down to get me fouled up!
Nah I ain’t tripping though
I just pick & roll out the way of those chicken hoes
For the give and go
I went from ashy to classic mayne
So what the fuck have you done lately?
This the big payback!
