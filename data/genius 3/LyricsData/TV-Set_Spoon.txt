[Verse 1]
Oh baby, I see you in my TV set
Yeah baby, I see you in my TV set
I cut your head off and put it in my TV set
I use your eyeballs for dials on my TV set
I watch TV, I watch TV
Since I put you in my TV set

[Verse 2]
Oh baby, I hear you on my radio
Yeah baby, I hear you on my radio
You know I flip, flip, flip for your lady-o
You're going drip, drip, drip on my radio
AM radio, PM radio
Since I tuned you inside my radio like this!

[Verse 3]
Oh baby, I see you in my Frigidaire
Yeah baby, I see you in my Frigidaire
Behind the mayonnaise, way in the back
I'm gonna see you tonight for a midnight snack
But though it's cold, you won't get old
Cause you're well preserved in my Frigidaire

[Verse 4]
Oh baby, look so good in my bed at night
Yeah baby, look so good in my bed at night
I could give you a million hugs
You look so good all covered up in bugs, oh
I missed some there under your chair
But that's all right, I'll sweep you under the rug

[Verse 5]
Oh baby, I see you in my TV set
Yeah baby, I see you in my TV set
I cut your head off and put it in my TV set
I use your eyeballs for dials on my TV set
I watch TV, I watch TV
Since I've seen you, I've been so upset
