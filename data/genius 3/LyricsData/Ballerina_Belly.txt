[Pre-Chorus]
She mix the red and white wine like the Catalina (She do it)
You call her a stripper, that's my ballerina (Oh God)
See that's your stage but it's my arena (She mine)
That's not a stripper, that's my ballerina (Hold up)

[Chorus]
Let me see you dance for me, dance, dance, dance
Do a handstand for me, dance, dance, dance (She do it)
Baby can you pop it for me? Dance, dance, dance
Let me see you drop it for me, dance, dance, dance

[Verse 1]
I said
Oh I'm takin' heavy, bring that big scale
I'd say don't ride my wave but that ship sailed (Do it!)
Man my dog still riding with that fish scale
Doing fishtails like he really miss jail
I got that sauce, got that marinara (sauce)
Talking hoes, I've had my fair share of (hoes)
She pulled up on me in that Panamera (yeah)
Thick white bitch look like Aguilera

[Pre-Chorus]
She mix the red and white wine like the Catalina (She do it)
You call her a stripper, that's my ballerina (Oh God)
See that's your stage but it's my arena (She mine)
That's not a stripper, that's my ballerina (Hold up)

[Chorus]
Let me see you dance for me, dance, dance, dance
Do a handstand for me, dance, dance, dance (She do it)
Baby can you pop it for me? Dance, dance, dance
Let me see you drop it for me, dance, dance, dance
(Drop it, drop it, drop it)

[Verse 2]
Oh you playing but I got the cheat code (Yeah)
Shallow bitches always got the deep quotes (Do it!)
The block is hot but the streets cold (Yeah)
Shoes designer but she got a cheap soul, oh
I drop the top on that Maranello
Big suitcases like we play the cello
Sleeping on me, get a bigger pillow
Live fast, die young just like Barrichello

[Pre-Chorus]
She mix the red and white wine like the Catalina (She do it)
You call her a stripper, that's my ballerina (Oh God)
See that's your stage but it's my arena (She mine)
That's not a stripper, that's my ballerina (Hold up)

[Chorus]
Let me see you dance for me, dance, dance, dance
Do a handstand for me, dance, dance, dance (She do it)
Baby can you pop it for me? Dance, dance, dance
Let me see you drop it for me, dance, dance, dance
(Drop it, drop it, drop it)

[Bridge]
Dance, dance, dance (Do it)
Dance, dance, dance (Yeah)
She just want the Ros√©, she don't want your roses
Watch the oil split the water like it's Moses
She just wanna pull up in the Benzes and them Rollses'
She don't never pay attention to the vultures

[Pre-Chorus]
She mix the red and white wine like the Catalina (She do it)
You call her a stripper, that's my ballerina (Oh God)
See that's your stage but it's my arena (She mine)
That's not a stripper, that's my ballerina (Hold up)

[Chorus]
Let me see you dance for me, dance, dance, dance
Do a handstand for me, dance, dance, dance (She do it)
Baby can you pop it for me? Dance, dance, dance
Let me see you drop it for me, dance, dance, dance
(Drop it, drop it, drop it)
