Imagine being a, not a, not necessarily a rapper but being an artist, who, like I draw from what's happening right now all the time. I draw from the conversation that's happening right now, and all I can think to rap about is, I'm around the biggest rapper in the world and my whole life has changed

Like, signing and being where I'm at really just put me in the middle of "All I gotta do is make music" and you never think about how much pressure you can put on yourself when all you gotta do is make music

When that's all you gotta do, and try to make you like this shit, and then try to make her like this shit, and try to make him like this shit, it's like, it fucks with your head G

Rapping and making music only shit that really, gives me some type of peace, peace of mind. It's like the first time in my life where I'm at like a peaceful place, and it's, it's like, you gotta find a way to make people identify with peace man, nobody really at peace

I stumble, mumble over words softly
Don't get caught up in the light, that's what the curb taught me
Ain't trying to be the righteous one, I'm trying to be the brightest son
Baby see my palace big as galaxy is, I'm inspired by the bad guy
I used to wanna rock them Gold Daytons
The song we harmonizing so taken
I dream of fantasizing old Aces
I gotta get you motherfuckers straightened
Brought the motherfucking braces, people, niggas only basic at your finest
At least the shit you paint is kind of honest
My shit is catatonic, I'm speaking to the sinners full of promise
I find my peace of mind in a vagina
Thank God that I'm a rhymer
Thank God that I'm an artist
Thank God that I got the lawyer for the charges
The shit I wanna make I can't afford it
I'm saving all the pennies and the quarters
This ain't the ninth inning, you're [?], drag racing with a tortoise

I got my project, my first project, yeah. I gotta empathize that it's my first project, but, yeah my project Cilvia. I just wanna take you on a ride. Just imagine getting off work at like 6 o'clock, 6PM, and like you don't go home, you with your homies, and you get home at like 6AM, that's what my project is

And I don't want to give you like a sum up of my whole life but like I can give you like, like the past two, three years, sum it up in like ten tracks, ten cool ass tracks, and, that's what I'm giving you

This is Isaiah Rashad, and I am REVOLT
