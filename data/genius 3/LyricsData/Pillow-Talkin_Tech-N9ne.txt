[Verse 1: Tech N9ne]
If you see thunder from a gun this is
Somethin' that'll get the heat on ya
When she's under the sheets on the beautiful sleep number
Don't no wake an yappin' when she's in a deep slumber
If we share secret And the scare, was equal to one of us
Gettin' the chair do you swear to keep it (Yes)
Meaning that under heat you wouldn't nare leak it
So when your woman's in your presence don't you dare speak it
Pillow talkin' get you caught up an brought up on charges
Shot up a lot and departed, it's nothin' short of retarded
'Cause when you say stuff and then you an your woman break up
You funkin' because your mouth wouldn't stay shut
How could you spread that? Can't believe you said that
Puttin' my life in jeopardy definitely it'll make the feds tap-Bed trap
What you tell your lady can make you take a dead nap
Fluff up your pillow an lay your head back

[Hook]
(You) Be pillow talkin'
(You) Don't be pillow talkin' (Don't say nothin')
(You) Be pillow talkin'
(You) Don't be pillow talkin'

[Verse 2: Scarface]
My advice for niggas is this - you can never trust no chick
It don't matter how silky the ho can stroke your dick
It don't matter how slimy the pussy hole gon' get
If a nigga talks to these bitches these hoes gon' snitch
(Shiit) I used to fuck this bitch
Had a husband with dope money an I had his snow bunny
Climbin' the bed post, feedin' her dog meat
In love with the nine inch, so she steady calls me
Tells me she's leavin', I know the reason
She know where the guns at, the lock box keys an
The floor safe combo but this here one ho
Was this dudes bad news knock on the front door
A man in a police suit, a girl with a black tooth
Get to the money she saw him countin' in the back room
But it doesn't end hear, the man with the cop suit
Shoots at the bitch once, pops an drops dude

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
I can tell you what the problem is - people try to be monogamous
Tell his woman a lot of shit, and he thinkin' he got a bottom bitch
Stop with the sentimental talks at night
If you're pillow talkin' then you ought to quit
When the heat comes with the quickness
Lookin' for the witness man your broad is it
Why you wanna spit it? I don't really get it
Givin' your woman the power to speak in a minute
Speakin' about a brother wanna cover your mud up
With the Nina but you the only one know I really did it
When it come back then you feel low
Because everyone know you ain't real though
'Cause them beans you spillin'
You known for squealin' an all you needed was a pillow
"I should have did the dirt, all by my lonely" like Treach say
But the company that you keep end up bein' phony, so the Tech spray
Never let no chick I hit get with that homie
'Cause the next day, she seein' right through me
Got them lenses on me, like an X-Ray
An I'm fed up with these rappers
Who be yappin' to these groupies
They flash them a little coochie
Then you blab an try to reduce me
And it always come back to me
So when I come through strapped with an Uzi
It ain't like "Damn why'd he shoot me?"
Usin' the nueve name too loosely

[Hook]
