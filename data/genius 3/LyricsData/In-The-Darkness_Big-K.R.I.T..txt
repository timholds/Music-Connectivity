[Hook: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
My forever baby  in the darkness
I never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
Oh no, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
And that’s forever baby, and that’s forever baby
You're my sunshine  in the darkness
Leave ya lonely, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
A puppet on some strings, she had me gone
Cause even if I was married with kids, no goin' home
She like,  “If you could sleep with an angel between the sheets
Would you give up your beliefs as I proceed to spread my wings?"
I’m like, If it’s good enough, maybe, I guess
I’m no saint I admit, sometimes I fall victim to flesh
I think you worth the regrets
Ifs and the maybes, I'll be down for pleasure
I think you should save it, let me rephrase it
Magic woman, palm reader, to say that you bomb
My records turn, [?]
I know your chakras aligned
The world can't define our spiritual bond
You more than sunshine in the dark

[Bridge: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
Let it shine like gold Put a Spell on you
Forever Baby you wanna say something
She let it shine like gold

[Hook: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
My forever baby  in the darkness
I never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
Oh no, never leave ya lonely
And that’s forever baby, and that’s forever baby in the darkness
You're my sunshine  in the darkness
Leave ya lonely, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness

[Bridge 2: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
Woa, and I think about you every time na-na
I think about ya every time na-na
Na-nanananana Na-nananana na-na-na-na
Let me see ya baby
Don’t worry bout any of them problems
I can see the light in you baby
In the darkest of dark you are my sunshine
Why don’t you come over
Woa brother, ye-yeah yeah you are my sunshine
Oh my sunshine baby

[Hook: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
My forever baby  in the darkness
I never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
Oh no, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness
And that’s forever baby, and that’s forever baby forever baby
You're my sunshine  in the darkness
Leave ya lonely, never leave ya lonely  in the darkness

[Outro: Big K.R.I.T.]
Hold up I’m trippin'
Smile
