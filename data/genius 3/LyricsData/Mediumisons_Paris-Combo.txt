CHORUS
Let’s mediumize, idiomize
Turn up the sound of our visions
Mediumize, idiomize
My memories are as sharp as a bed of nails
On which I lie down like a valorous fakir
Each new day does nothing to rub out the previous days
I want something virginal, read from a palm
But at the moment I’m living in a time that
The science-fiction novels that I read as a child
Imagined full of mutant robots and
Teleportation. It would have been astonishing...
CHORUS
I’ve thrown out the line and the hook and sinker
Is the bait naive or the fish cunning?
I apply myself but I panic when nothing bites
I’m afraid of the insipidness of the future
Throw myself far away, catapult myself
Tear myself from the present and leave the imperfect
I want an escape, for tomorrow to be a dream
Like a Houdini of nightmares
