So you do not know what you have got until it is gone
Cannot change my tune but i sure can change the song
And you know the show must go on
How long
Yeah how long
Tell me how long
You do not know what you have got until it is gone
Cannot change my tune but i sure can change the song
And you know the show must go on
How long
Yeah how long
You will never know just what you had
I tell myself that there is never any going back
There is no time for feeling so sad
Let go
Just let go
Just let it go

Well kiss this goodbye
Just let go
Let it go
Giving up the

Well easy come and easy go
Reaping the seeds that someone else has sown
Nothing is sacred and i should know
I know
Yeah i know
You will never know just what you had
I tell myself that there is never any going back
There is no time for feeling so sad
Let go
Let it go
Just let it go

Giving up the ghost
