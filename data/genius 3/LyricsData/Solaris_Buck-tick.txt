Aru hi chouchou ni natte
Aru hi umi wo yuku
Aru hi kimi to deatte
Aru hi ai wo shiru
Onegai ga aru no sayonara no kisetsu
Aru hi sakana ni natte
Aru hi sora wo yuku
Aru hi yume ga owatte
Aru hi me wo tojiru
Onegai ga arunda sayonara no kisetsu
Kami-sama yume wo
Yume wo misete okure maboroshi de mo ii
Mezame no asa haruka yume de aeru ne
Chiisa na chiisa na kimi wa yagate sora ni nari
Ooki na ooki na ai de boku wo tsutsumu yo
Onegai ga arunda sayonara no kisetsu
Kami-sama yume wo
Yume wo yume wo misete maboroshi de mo ii
Mezame no asa haruka yume de aeru ne
Chiisa na chiisa na kimi wa yagate sora ni nari
Ooki na ooki na ai de boku wo tsutsumu yo

Music: Imai Hisashi
Then one day I'll become a butterfly
Then one day I'll fly into the sea
Then one day, one day I will meet you
Then one day, love will come to me
Is there something you're wishing for
In the season of goodbye
Then one day, you'll become a fish and
Then one day you'll swim into the sky
Then one day, this dream will be over
Then one day, you will close your eyes
There is something I'm wishing for
In the season of goodbye
God, oh please give me a dream
Let me oh let me oh let me dream
Even if it's an illusion
Far in the morning when I awake
I know I'll see you in a dream
Tiny so tiny are you at last
Vanishing into the heavens
Love yeah, with your love, a love so vast
I feel you eveloping me
There is something I'm wishing for
In the season of goodbye
God, oh please give me a dream
Dream yeah a dream yeah give me a dream
Even if it's a delusion
Far in the morning when I awake
I know I'll see you in a dream
Tiny so tiny are you at last
Vanishing into the heavens
Love yeah, with your love, a love so vast
I feel you eveloping me
