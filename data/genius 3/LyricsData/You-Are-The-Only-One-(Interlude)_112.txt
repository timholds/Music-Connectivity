I love you
You're my everything
You are the only one for me
Well, well, well
And everythig that I do
Is for you and me
So never leave
(I can't breathe without you)
Just stay with me
Oh, 112, tell me

You are the only one for me, baby
And everything that I do
Is for you and me
So never leave
Just stay with me
(Repeat above until fade)
