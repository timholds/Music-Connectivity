[Chorus:]
I'll be your bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to
I'll be your bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to
Get over problems in your way
And I will pick you up
Over mountains high
Together we'll walk over the bridge

[Verse: Beyonce]
There's a place where you can go
Lay your head down comfortable
And it's always there for sure
Don't you know
And it comes as no surprise
Mountains that you must climb
Sit back don't run away
Have no shame
(There's no wrong)
There's no wrong
(There's no right)
No right
(It's only you, and how you treat your life)
See, baby
If the road you choose
Don't work out for you
You know (You know)
I'll be your rescue
Sugar, sugar

[Chorus:]
I'll be your bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to
Get over problems in your way
And I will pick you up
Over mountains high
Together we'll walk over the bridge

[Verse: Beyonce:]
Like a diamond shining bright
See you are young and flying high
Big dreams of having things
In your eyes (do-do, do-do, hey!)
You thought it all
Was making cash
But, uh
That small means never lasts
Had to throw it all away
Hear me say

[Bridge:]
Let me take far away
You're sure to find your destiny
And you know without a doubt
That I will be your bridge out

[Sample:]
I'll be the-
And I will-

[Chorus:]
I'll be your bridge you can use to
Whenever you need to
Get over problems in your way
And I will pick you up
Over mountains high
Together we'll walk over the bridge
