[Verse]: A.G
No longer on the low, I gotta flow is what I mean
Let the critics flow they can't tamper with the Jolly Green
No longer on the low because my flows be tight
On my own shit, A to the G is who I be like
The neighborhood sickness makes you feel the pain
But the medicine got the brain numb like novacaine
We're hot, got the flavors, Show & A got the flavors
Now come on with the get down
A full blitz when I put wits to song
More flavors than them fifty-four elevens your bitch got on
Next level is what it's time for
94 missed us, but check us when nine pound wind down
Forget the fame, because my aim is the riches
Even Robert DeNiro, he ain't seeing more witches
The streets is filled with chickens, some finger-licking
I need that queen that represents by all means
You're bopping your head, now watch it spread like cancer
On the move like Go-Go, Burn you like Jo Jo Dancer
You can't relate because my raps are the roughest
Retaliate, but your wrath is roughless
Fear no human being, seeing me is rare
Time has took its toll, I can tell by your tears
A man amongst children and my records make a killing
Like tobacco, I got a fat flow, worth a million
You better breeze cause you're finished
You'll get sprayed like Afro Sheen, got more green than spinach
Time to roll, I got my squad on patrol
Trying to find the phony fellas faking like they got soul
