Trusted, repeated
Candor, uneven - in it's will to find
The right design
The form belongs, to no one
Holding truth

Come see me through
Come through the sea
To share
And bare
The light inside of you

[Chorus]
Don't cast away, Don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you

Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
Open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives - to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you

Be more than words
Be more than strength and kind
Be love and blind
To those who come to you

Sing something new
Belief is wet and ghost
Yet, loves the most of what we do

[Chorus]
Don't cast away, don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you

Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
Open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives - to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you

Those winter days
Those winter nights
Those days and those nights

Come see me through
Come through the sea
To bare
And share
The light inside of you

[Chorus]
Don't cast away, Don't cast away
Don't let them cast a role for you

Find the sun, force the moon
Loose the earth
For dreams come to those who let them in their guarded room
Open wide your winged-eye
Spirit dives - to catch your truth
For spirit thrives where darkness comes to challenge you

Challenge you, challenge you
Challenge you
