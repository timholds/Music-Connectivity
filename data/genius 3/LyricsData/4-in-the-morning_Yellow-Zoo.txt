4 in the morning and I'm seeking for closure
Matter fact welcome to the metaphorical ocean
Dont get drenched
I fell asleep on a train i got pinched
And woke up to cart full of
Purple suited pimps yeah
Thats my imagination working
And I'm with it
I'm probably high
I dont know
But dont start trippen'
I always thought to myself
Why dont i do more
Dedicate to a craft
Instead pullin' girls like a tug a war
Then if i blow
Am I the man?
Probably catch a body  
And hire the same lawer as zimmerman
Open ya eyes
And realize life a blank book
I refuse to write chapter by characters on Facebook   
I'm being honest
Probably a little modest
I'm on the train writing but i hope they dissecting the knowledge 
He get fly
With dreams of being a pilot
But he teen passa paying
Like he paying homage
She is finest
Dreams for being a doctor
But she on the book
Lms for a to be honest
Well to be honest
You worth more than side chick
Deactivate your Facebook
And you have accomplished nothing
As i walk through the valleys of death
My rymthes is my protecter
And they gone feel my wrath
And feel my pain
New rymthes
New people
Ain't no sleep gain
This pete on the train
This is fleets on the train
I serve a better cause
But now I'm the black sheep of the fam
Ima' keep on again
I get it!
Live as you were to die tomorrow
But learn as you were to live forever
I dont present myself as the man above
But i am clever
And here to I'm here to andover other endeavors
I heard Brooklyn back
Brooklyn back
Yeah the back to this game i hope the spine dont snap
I wanna save this world
And nah' you don't gotta' pay me
Man i like the new hov
But i relate to old jay-z
My dude jigga
Always talking bout his new figures
Granted you rich i put my problems in a swisher
And i gotta' worry bout' bums with hick ups
And you over there probably writing your will up
Ain't' thats something? ain't' that something?
But i don't care cause i'll be at your next concert fist pumping
I'm unorthodox but I'm smoother than a new mopped floor
And some silky smooth silky sox
Did i say that? did i really say that?
Is hip hop back can you put it on your hip like a real pager
Is this a movie? Is this a movie?
Is gucci mane gonna' tattoo another smoothie?
Did i really slip Beyonce my number at the awards
Outside, looking at jay-z like hi boy

4 in the morning and I'm seeking for closure
Matter fact welcome to the metaphorical ocean
Dont get drenched

4 in the morning and I'm seeking for closure
Matter fact welcome to the metaphorical ocean
Dont get drenched
