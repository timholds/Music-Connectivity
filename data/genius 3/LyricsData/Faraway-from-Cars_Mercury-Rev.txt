There's a little part of you
Faraway from cars
Faraway from cash
That's faraway from war
Faraway from tears
And faraway from the past
Faraway from here

Faraway from here
Faraway from shore
Faraway from war
And faraway from tears

Faraway from cash
Faraway from cars
Faraway from fear
And faraway from the past
So faraway from here
