She's quite the mediator
A smoother operator you will never see
She'll see you later
No one dare disobey her openly

She knows music
I know music too, you see
She got the power
The teen queen, Rosalie

Rosalie
Rosalie
Rosalie
Rosalie

She's got the pleasure
Comes from all the cornerstones of the world
She's so fantastic
She's everybody's favorite little record girl

She knows music
I know music too, you see
She got the power
I got the power, Rosalie

Rosalie
Rosalie
Rosalie
Rosalie

Down on me, Rosalie
Shine on me will you please

From Chattanooga to good old Booga Loosa
You can hear her fine
She makes the choices
Then you'd best be smiling when it's choosing time

She knows music
I know music too, you see
She's got the power
She is a tower, Rosalie

Rosalie
Rosalie
