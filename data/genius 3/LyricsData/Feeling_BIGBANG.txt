Translation:

Yeah we back Big Bang aw yeah
And my man Boys Noize in da house
Woo wee party people
Let's go let's go let's go

Let's move here we go
Get loose ya'll know
We gon reach for the sky yup
Party like our time's up
Let's move here we go
Get loose ya'll know
Throw your hand's up in the air
Jump on up like you don't care

The alleyway streelight flickers
The lights twinkle one by one
Feel this familiar deep night, whoever you are
There's no need to care about the other's eyes
In the jungle of buildings that fill up Seoul
You shine more than the neon signs
I'm scared that you might leave
Everything about this brilliant night is intense but
I'm getting turned on at this moment
Do wanna be together today?

The night isn't that long
It's not easy to just stop
Everybody move move
The happy mothers and fathers

Leave the music like this
Dance and sing loudly
Don't stop this feeling
It can't get any better than this (x2)

Ma baby your red lips look like cherry red
My eyes are fixed and steady
But just looking would be impolite
Hey my baby I'm your daddy
Look, I can't let you go with this reluctant feeling
Between us, there's already no limit
Don't be shy, it's just one one night
The lights go off and it's silent
Oh my goodness, there's a twist to her, she's so hot call 911

The night isn't that long
It's not easy to just stop
Everybody move move
The men and ladies

Leave the music like this
Dance and sing loudly
Don't stop this feeling
It can't get any better than this (x3)

Let's move here we go
Get loose ya'll know
We gon reach for the sky yup
Party like our time's up
Let's move here we go
Get loose ya'll know
Throw your hand's up in the air
Jump on up like you don't care

I'm crazy more than ever
I'm crazy more than ever
And it feels so right
Tonight is the night
I'm crazy more than ever
I'm crazy more than ever
And it feels so right
I can't stopped
