I say I'm ridin, I'm swervin
Barely missing the curb
I got this bad bitch and she twerkin
Hit the parking lot and we murk this shit
On purpose, on purpose
We hit the club and we hurtin them folks
On purpose, on purpose
You can save the hate it ain't workin

Say I'm ridin, I'm swervin
Barely missing the curve
I got this bad bitch and she twerkin
Hit the parking lot and we murk this shit
On purpose, on purpose
Don't try me dawg we'll fuck you up
On purpose, on purpose
Automatic K and its squirtin' (Bow!)

Hard in the paint like Josh Smith, do not slip, I bang mine
