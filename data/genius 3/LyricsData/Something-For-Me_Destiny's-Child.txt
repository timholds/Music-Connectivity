Baby, I'ma find a way
Try harder each day
To get with you
And, boy, you know
That you think of me
'Cause there are possibilities
For you and me

[Verse 1: Beyoncé & (Destiny's Child)]
It started out just as friends
(But now, we've changed)
And it's obvious, oh

Mmmmm, baby
You can give me a chance
And you can be my man

My Baby!
