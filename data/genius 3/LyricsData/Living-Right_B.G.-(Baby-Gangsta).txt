It's time I bounce back
Ya'll ain't seen me in a while
Close your eyes
I got a ridiculous smile (bling!)
On the left wrist
Think it's 'bout fifty G's (damn!)
And on the right wrist
Think it's 'bout the same thing (fuck!!)
Now 'round my neck
Aw, this shit's so blue
Got niggas tuckin' they chains in
When I come through
I got a tight crew
Roll with nothin' but soldiers
Oh, you can run up
Believe, you been got ran over
I'm in the black Rover (Rover)
Phantom 'bout the chauffeur (chauffeur)
The comeback kid back bitch, game over
You ain't wanna believe me
I tried to told ya
[?] play wit' me
I knocked his head off his shoulders
I'm a choppa toilin'
Get it right and keep it right
I feel good cause my whole clique eatin' right
I got plays that's cool so get like a man
I told you haters that I was gon' have a lamb

Katrina came through
Flooded a nigga out (out)
I'm runnin' through the tray
Like I'm still uptown (town)
I told ya once before
My ghetto bench was worldwide (wide)
Without that dolla' sign
Nigga just a steel shine (shine)
I go walk through Atlanta
You in his zone (in his zone)
All alone and walk out
With all my jewelry on (yup)
I'm real to the bone (bone)
Don't fuck wit' me I'm a G
I'm even worse cause
I got soldiers slim livin' free
Get no sleep
I think I'm a miss somethin'
And I'm a hustler
So when I sleep
I miss money
And I'm a get money
One way or another
If you ain't know
I'm a go-gettin' muthafucka
But this thing ain't nothin'
I ain't even got started yet
Get yo head
Choppa City boys up next
Everybody wonderin' what's my next move
I'm a just tell ya
It's a seven-figure groove

Poppin' bottles at the bar
Say it's nothin' (it's nothin')
Ridin' good through the hood
Say it's nothin' (it's nothin')
Fuckin' other niggas' bitches

If ya love just stuntin'
Say it's nothin' (it's nothin')
