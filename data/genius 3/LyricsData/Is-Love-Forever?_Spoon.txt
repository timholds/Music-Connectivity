[Verse]
I grew up in a supermarket it was there they told me
If they can't find me they won't leave without me
Now or ever
All I need's a word to get me started, all I need's a look
Some ex-girlfriend, call her Heather
Whispers to me-Is love forever?
Is love forever?
Is love?
Are you quite certain, love?
When I'm older, start to wonder was that love or instinct working?
Have I even felt it ever?
What's the object?
Is love forever?
