[Verse 1]
She never loved me, after all how could she
When all she'd do is tell me how amazing I could be
But never was I good enough to be the one she would see
Every time she closed her eyes and had another good dream
I'd tell her how I feel, but she would simply just ignore it
What was once a pretty picture is turning out to be distorted
Take a line of anger snort it it's like her heart just had a shortage
I would hope she'd pay attention, but she never could afford it
And now I'm no longer important, but she'd stick around I missed the sound
Of comfort in her words, but all she does is just get pissed and frown
I'm wishing now that we could go back to the hugs and kisses how
Could this turn out the way it did maybe she will listen now
The things I did were overlooked and love was all I needed
Slowly she began to form an attitude became conceited
Every night we'd fuss and fight she'd always take my heart and beat it
Til she finally made it stop, she told me that she cheated

[Hook]
I used to think you were the one to let my love unfurl
You used to make my winters wild and my summers swirl
Til you took my heart and sent it to the underworld
Now it's over, I'm moving on to another girl

[Verse 2]
You see I thought I was in love with her it took a while to notice
That she never was the one for me and now my heart feels homeless
The recovery's the slowest part of break ups Cupid showed us
Lies and now I feel the coldest we all need someone to hold us right
Imma be a man about it
Saw the heartbreak coming but thought what if I just ran around it
Man there was no way I had to face it couldn't stand the sound it
Made up in my head am I ok right now oh man I doubt it
How could you just do this after everything we've been through
See I tried to look away, but now it's every single issue
Popping up I can't keep up with it you'd never think I'd miss you
I was looking for true love and simply thought I'd seek it with you
But that shit nearly destroyed me had me broken at my weakest
Thinking all the lies I ate were simply spoken out of sweetness
All my digging for the truth was just provoking all the meanness
Now I'm showing how you made me feel and hoping that you'll see this

[Hook]

[Bridge]
"Hey, umm... It's me
I was just thinking about you
Umm... I miss you
I wanted to see if we could talk sometime
Maybe get a second chance
I kind of miss how we used to be
I want that again, like restart
Umm... Give me a call sometime
I love you... Bye"

[Hook]
