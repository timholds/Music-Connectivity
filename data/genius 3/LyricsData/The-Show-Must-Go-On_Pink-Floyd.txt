[Intro]
(Ooooh, Ma, Oooh Pa)
Must the show go on?
(Ooooh, Pa. Take me home)
(Ooooh, Ma. Let me go)

[Verse: David Gilmour]
There must be some mistake
I didn't mean to let them
Take away my soul
Am I too old, is it too late?
(Ooooh, Ma, Ooooh Pa)
Where has the feeling gone?
(Ooooh, Ma, Ooooh Pa)
Will I remember the song?
The show must go on
