[Verse 1]
This was wrong, right from the start
Nothin' more than a one way ticket to a, broken heart
Lock me up, throw away the key
No matter how you see it, this just can't be

[Chorus]
Oh I know that you belong to someone else
And I try, but I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
I can see the dark clouds buildin', buildin' up ahead
The devil singin' like a chorus of angels, messin' with my head
With all my strength, all my power, I fight the fight
As much as it feels good to us, it's just not right

[Chorus]
Oh I know that you belong to someone else
Oh I try, but I can't help myself

[Chorus]
Oh I know that you belong to someone else
Oh I try, oh I can't help myself
