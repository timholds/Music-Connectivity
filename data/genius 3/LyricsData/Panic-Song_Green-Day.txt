[Verse 1]
Ready for a cheap escape
On the brink of self-destruction
Widespread panic
Broken glass inside my head
Bleeding down these thoughts of anguish
Mass confusion

[Chorus]
Well, the world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shit
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with I don't care

[Verse 2]
There's a plague inside of me
Eating at my disposition
Nothing's left
Torn out of reality
To a state of no opinion
Limp with hate

[Chorus]
Well, the world is a sick machine
Breeding a mass of shit
With such a desolate conclusion
Fill the void with I don't care

[Outro]
I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out
I wanna jump out
