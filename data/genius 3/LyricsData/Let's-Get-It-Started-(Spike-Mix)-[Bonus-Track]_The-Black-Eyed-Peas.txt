In this context, there's no disrespect
So when I bust my rhyme, you break yo necks
We got 5 minutes for us to disconnect
From all intellect and let the rhythm effect
To lose this inhibition
Follow your intuition
Free your inner soul
And break away from tradition
'Cause when we be out
Girl it's gonna be that
You wouldn't believe how
We wow shit out
Burn it till it's burned out
Turn it till it's turned out
Actin' up from north, west

Lose control, all body, all soul
Don't move too fast, people just take it slow
Don't get ahead, just jump into it
Y'all hear about it, the Peas'll do it
Get it started, get stupid
Don't worry 'bout it people we'll walk you through it
Step by step, like the infant new kid
Inch by inch, with the new solution
Transmit hits, with no delusion
The feeling's irresistible and that's how we move it, yo
