[Verse 1]
She knows what's been keeping him out too late
She never was the kind to sit around and wait
She loosened the locket he gave her
She took off her wedding band
And when he gets home he'll find
All she's left behind is

[Chorus]
Silver and gold
Haven't they lost their shine
Tonight she let go for the last time
Just silver and gold
Ties that no longer bind her
Now he's left alone with silver and gold

[Verse 2]
He could've kept her love so easily
It wasn't like she didn't try to make him see
But once she made up her mind
There was no turning back
And he's going to understand
When all he's holding in his hands is

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And what once was sacred, only yesterday
They don't mean a thing as she walks away

[Chorus]
