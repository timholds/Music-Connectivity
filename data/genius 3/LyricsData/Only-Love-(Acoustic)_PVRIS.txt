I'm hoping you weren't heaven sent
Cause only hell knows where you've been
Your built composure's wearing thin
And all your walls are caving in
Before you shut this down
I just wanna lift you up
I'll take all this love I found
And I hope that it's enough

I saw you, yeah you, you're breaking down
I hope you, yeah you, you come around
Now don't you shut this down ooh no don't you give this up
I took all this love I found and I hope that it's enough
Is it enough?

If we don't bend then this might break
Please don't give into this pain
Just keep on counting down the days
And dream of me to keep you safe

Don't you shut this down
No, don't you give this up
I took all this love I found and I hope that it's enough
I saw you, yeah you, you're breaking down
I hope you, yeah you, you come around
Now don't you shut this down oh no don't you give this up
I took all this love I found and I hope that it's enough
Is it enough?

Don't you shut this down
Don't you give this up
Don't you shut this down
Don't you give this up
Before you came around
I was lost and out of place
You're the only love I found and I'm hoping that you'll stay
Please stay
Please stay
Please stay
