(Chorus):
Back when rappers could rap that’s the age I miss
Used a roots instrumental just to pay homage
Notebooks black thoughts ain’t a page I miss
I see all the bullshit wanna I raise my fist
Raise my fist, Raise my fist
It’s me against the world there’s no way I quit
You try to lock me in a cage, so this cage I ripped
Pipe dreams in my brain you can’t fade my bliss…

(Verse 1):
You said I didn’t have flow, I hope, you with it now
Bcuz I do, But I just choose to strip it down
That way it allows, you to see the pictures when I’m paintin’ em
So you can worry about what I’m sayin’ not how I’m sayin’ it
Rakim said it, don’t sweat the technique but I sweat it
You indebted to the 4 years I put into this craft that’s dead it’s
It’s a fact these rappers don’t got half that technic
-al skill I put in before I even asked that I step in
The studio, I said you indebted I don’t mean debit
Talkin’ to you record execs I want my cashback credit
I gotta pile a classics in my backpack ready
For when I blow overnight I’m on the fasttrack steady
Anthologies locked away how I work it’s berserk
Hate me cuz I speak out against shit, with my merciless words
Mind of a veteran like ptsd nervousness worse
Think of the hurt of the earth, assertin’ my turf

(Chorus):

(Verse 2):
I’m bout to lay the new foundation rockin’ the stage
As I keep searchin’ my lost heartbeat for pockets of change
Rhyme schemes spill with ease in my talkative rage
On the page, been doin’ this since I was crawlin’ a maze
I rap till I blow a lung out, ain’t not sleep if I don’t finish
I get on the beat and rip it, So smooth they would think I’m trippin’
Macbook explodes with rap documents too many I don’t think I can fit em
Bleed anger like horny-toad lizard, cold sweat drippin
Plip plup on the stage wood, I ain’t like my friends emotions ain’t hidden, but they get turned off by honesty, So I’m mic grippin
I shit on your freestyles with my nice written
The system ain’t right all these rappers be ice fishin’
Reign is on the radio, unannounced hail snow
Punchlines blow up from mines of the underground railroad
You said I am not the best, so I’m back with the rage
Shovin’ Neanderthal rappers right back in the caves

(Chorus):

(Verse 3):
16 on the scene I come out with a bang
I don’t wanna fit in like Gandhi pushed outta the train
Man the way I be displayin’ these lyrics it’s like an exhibition
I got 30 raps that would fit in the top 10 ever written
I just wanna leave my mark in the sands of time what I do on earth
And be happy with the eternal wormhole of the universe
I gotta save the human race so I must kill these
Wack poets cuz to me, they nothin’ but Lil B
Ok you want me some stream of consciousness raps then
That’s when, every hot rapper list goes in the trash bin
And I spit over used beats with twice as much passion
Oh and did I forget to mention that they were classics
Got my math class raps out for you X factor actors
Ten thousand hours down for this craft that I mastered
Deflatin’ classism and modern naziism
Enter indigo fields of my ajna chakra gandhiism
Breakin’ nike shirts with polyrhythms, we naughty gremlins
Ready to make an entrance robbin’ for the hoods and shock the system
Burnt Orangutans fallin’ from canopy beds fighting now
If you want oxygen got some advice for you sign me now

(Outro):
Huh, So there it is
You find a rapper that can rap like that,  then you can compare em
But I don't wanna hear anyone, talking' bout skill, equating to sales (I see you Kanye, I see you)
Back when rappers could rap age I miss
