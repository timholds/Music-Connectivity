The tree's in the corner
The fire's burnin' bright
Shadows dancin'
In the pale candlelight
Life should be a rainbow
But it's blue
It won't be Christmas without you

I wrapped up all your presents
Wrote my name on every card
I just can't help it baby
I'm taking this so hard
You tell me, what's a man to do
'cause it won't be Christmas without you

I stare into the flame
All I see is your face
All this joy and happiness seems so out of place
As far as I'm concerned
It's just a day I must get through
It won't be Christmas without you
