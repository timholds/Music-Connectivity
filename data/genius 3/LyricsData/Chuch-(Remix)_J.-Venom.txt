[Intro]

[Verse]
Uh, Back with a vengeance
Killin' motherfuckers, and they parents and they kids bitch
Nah, I'm just playing, I ain't play like that
Ya'll know Venom here, asthma attack
Smell it in the air, mix of heroin and crack
Ya'll know me, always got a sack
Got what you need man, always got ya back
Keep it motherfuckin' real, don't brag about racks
Or talk bout' runnin' round toting all the straps
Matter of fact man I keep it kind of level
Check me from the outside, see average fellow
And that's the way I like it, got my reasons and my rhymes
Keep the heat low, no seasons for time
Hate getting out in the cold of the Midwinter
Wondering how the fuck I'm gonna scrounge up for my dinner
So I keep my shield up and my coat on
Man, fuck this song

[Outro]
