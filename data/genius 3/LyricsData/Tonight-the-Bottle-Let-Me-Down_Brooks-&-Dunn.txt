Tonight, the bottle let me down
It let your memory come around
Yeah, the one true friend I thought I'd found
Well, tonight, the bottle let me down

Each night, I leave the barroom when it's over
Not feeling any pain at closing time
But tonight, your memory found me much too sober
I couldn't drink enough to keep you off my mind

And tonight, the bottle let me down
And it let your memory come around
Yeah, the one true friend I thought I'd found
Yeah, tonight, the bottle let me down

I've always had a bottle I could turn to
And lately, I've been turning every day
But the wine don't take effect the way it used to
Well, I'm hurting in an old familiar way

And tonight, the bottle let me down
It let your memory come around
Well, the one true friend I thought I'd found
Well, tonight, the bottle let me down
Yeah, tonight the bottle let me down
