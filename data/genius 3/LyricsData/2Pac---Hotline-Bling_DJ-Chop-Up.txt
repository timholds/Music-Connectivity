You used to call me on my cell phone
Only when you need to  fuck
Call me on my cell phone
Only when you need to fuck
And I know when that hotline bling
What the fuck am I tryna sing?
And I know when that hotline bling
What the fuck am I tryna sing?

[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Was it the liquor, that makes me act blind, times that I'm with her
Anonymous pictures of other niggas tryin' to kiss her
Will I love her or shall I diss her?
I'm sick of this scandalous shit I deal wit', tryin' to paint a perfect picture
My memories of jealousy no longer carefree
Cause so much bullshit your girlfriends keep tellin' me
I'm on tour, but now my bedroom's an open door
So it got me thinkin', what am I tryin' for?
When I was young I was so very dumb, eager to please
A lil', trick on a mission tryin' to get in my P
Me and my niggas is thug niggas, former known drug dealers
We don't love bitches and believe, they don't love niggas
I gotta blame my attraction
But you became a distraction, a threat to my paper stackin'
I thought you changed but now I know
Can't turn a ho into a housewife, baby

You used to call me on my cell phone
Only when you need to  fuck
Call me on my cell phone
Only when you need to fuck
And I know when that hotline bling
What the fuck am I tryna sing?
And I know when that hotline bling
What the fuck am I tryna sing?

[Verse 2: Kastro]
These silly bitches got this game twisted
That's why I ain't really tryna claim bitches
Niggas don't hang can give you game on the same bitches
That be them aim bitches that say they loyal
Promised to do some thangs, care for you but make things so spoiled
Truly cutie bootie bang, but that moving nothing my crib
When I can see from the door, she sure ain't shit
But you in love with her
Wanna go to the club with her
And when you stuck, she up like an ordinary thug nigga

[Verse 3: Kadafi]
See girlfriend I know, your whole M.O.'s preoccupied with mostly
Gettin' clown after clown, town coast to coast - see
I been tryin to stay away from sluts like you
Got me turned off completely by that sheisty shit that you do
Knew from jump yo' aim, straight through them spandex, don't front
Just name, spots on yo' body for me to touch while you clutch this game
I keep flowin like H20 it ain't nothin' for me to say
Why you keep actin like a ho?

[Verse 4: ???]
Damn
What makes these hoes
Wanna go
To the point where you can't find em no 'mo
Solo, better hate 'em more than Frodo
Trick, I thought you said you was done with that ho shit
But now you back it too ho
You need to take your time and flow to succeed
What it really means to be a lady
Instead of giving up the pussy crazy
You need to raise some fucking babies
So they don't grow up
With a mom, yeah a ho slut
But all your dumb ass can say is "so what?"
