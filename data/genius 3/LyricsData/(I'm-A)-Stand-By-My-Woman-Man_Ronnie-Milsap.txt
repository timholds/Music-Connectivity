At five o'clock she knows I'll soon be home
She don't worry bout me running round
Cause all of my good times are waitin' right there for me
And she knows where I'll be when the sun goes down
I'm a stand by my woman man our world turns around a little gold band
And love leads us through life hand in hand
I'm a stand by my woman man we fall asleep at night thinking ain't love grand
That's why I'm a stand by my woman man
When she's down she knows I'll be beside her
Cause I'm not just her lover I'm her friend
Our love keeps gettin' better and I'll gladly spend forever
Standin' by the woman who stands by her man
I'm a stand by my woman man...
I'm a stand by my woman man...
