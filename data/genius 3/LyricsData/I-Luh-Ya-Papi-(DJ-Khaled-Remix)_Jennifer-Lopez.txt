I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
Yeah that my papi
I luh ya luh ya luh ya papi
All my mami's bounce

[Tyga]
I keep it trill for a baddie like you
Cause you a bad chick and your friends bad too
Your body is my temple, Imma have to praise you
Or write it on the wall, Imm have to tatoo

[Verse 1: French Montana]
I love you, mami, I-I love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami
Shorty got me catching feelings
And that rave drop reaching for the ceiling
Southside Bronx, Teterboro, just overseas
Take the pants out here, drop to her knees
Oh my, I'm a don like Omar
Speed it up slow ma, throw it back, throw my
Rock-rock Gators like my Detroit players
You can hate to love us, you can love to hate us
From the bottom it been real
From the bottom shorty been trill
And even though we made it to the top
Still J.Lo from the-the the block
Ey, I love you, mami, I love you, mami
Baby, you the shit, I-I love you, mami

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Big Sean]
Do you love me? Do you swear?
Am I still the one? Even when I'm not there
Cause you know how it go and go
When you wanna go and go
Have you seen what's her face?
Is her number in your phone?
And your answer's yes and yes
But you still say no and no
Even though I know you know
I know I know you know I know
You know? It sound dumb-de-dumb-dumb
They say what we want's wrong, fuck it
Least know what we want
And it sucks to see you cry
Know a brokenhearted girl could make the whole world drown
And even though your makeup smears
Man I'm the one that's been the clown, why the fuck we around?
Cause girl you know I got that jaw drop shit
Plus I know your insecurities, that mall cop shit
I give you that screwface shit
Bring the ugly side out, two faced shit
Tryin' all new ways shit
One night turn into a few days shit
I luh yah J-Lo

[Jennifer Lopez]
I didn’t see it
But I see it now
I think I love you
And I need you now
Ain’t had none like you in a while

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyga]
Who that, better than your T pop your rolex
Get you one limit, Spend till you head ache (dizzy)
We can go round when your ready (light weight or like wait)
Pack heavy overnight like a Fed-Ex (You Know)
I like em brown, Puerto Rican, J-Lo
You the only one like a peso
Long pretty pelo
Mami be the angel with that halo
T-Raw playa, leave her around me Imma take her
That's what you lack, top bar we on top it
What you talkin, if you talk bout how I'm stuntin
Where it's tropic, We ain't waitin for the summer
I know you want to scream it (...)
I luh you too J-Lo

[Jennifer Lopez]
All day, 24 hour
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drop it how you want, I ain't trying to call Miley
I'm loving me some you
Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof
Cause I love my papi
