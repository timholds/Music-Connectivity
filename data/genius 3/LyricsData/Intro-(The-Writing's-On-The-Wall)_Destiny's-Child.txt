[Kelly:]
LeToya Barzini I wanna thank you
For having you organize
This meeting here today

[LeToya:]
And Kelly Steracki I also want to thank you
And all the other
Dons of the four families
Beyonce Corleone, from the South West, ah
LaTavia Menser from the
Four-Four

[LaTavia:]
Our objective of this meeting today is to discuss Destiny's Child's
Commandments of relationships

[Kelly:]
You know it's so unfortunate, so unnecessary
For us to end up with broken hearts

[LaTavia:]
Yes ,Godfather
Times have changed
Relationships aren't like the old days
You know?

[LeToya:]
See what we need is a man of his word
All this, uh, cheating, uh, backstabbing, uhm, hating
No more, no more

[LaTavia:]
But, Godfather
How do we avoid all these mishaps?

[Beyonce:]
It's obvious
The Writing's On The Wall;
Thou shalt not hate
