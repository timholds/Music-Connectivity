[Verse 1]
I've been walking in my sleep
I've been walking in my sleep
I've been moving both my legs but they don't belong to me
(Don't belong to me)
Shiny people on the streets but I just can't relate
(I just can't relate)
No it doesn't mean a thing, watch it all just float away

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I awake
If I've been dreaming all my life?
Don't let me know
This isn't really happening

[Chorus]
Sleepwalking away cause I'm dreaming
Sleepwalking away cause I'm dreaming

[Verse 2]
I've been talking in my sleep
I've been talking in my sleep
Like a record in reverse telling secrets I should keep
All these words they come out wrong
At least that's the way it seems
See, I've been using the word love but I don't know what it means

[Refrain]
Am I awake
If I've been dreaming all my life?
Don't let me know
This isn't real
It only feels that way to me from time to time
Is this really happening?

[Chorus]
Sleepwalking away cause I'm dreaming
Sleepwalking away cause I'm dreaming
Sleepwalking away cause I'm dreaming
Sleepwalking away cause I'm dreaming
