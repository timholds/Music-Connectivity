[Verse 1: Alex Ruffin]

Dag I'm feeling like hacksaw
With the wood in my hand now I'm boutta just blast off these thoughts
They splattered all over this white paper
What I'm doing I'm in the cut as if a taper
Feeling hella clutch like Reggie Miller on Pacers
You can never bite my style even with the teeth of a saber
A young Jedi with a baby blue light saber
A Yoda like mind state they darker then Darth Vader uh
I'm real evocative with speech
I got a dollar and a dream, a hundred followers that tweet
They acknowledge what I speak so I'm positive I'mma be
What they believe in, so I'mma go off
The pencil equal the needle now I'm boutta sow off
Fake people more like Mosquitoes man they bout to know off
With plenty to learn never acting like I know all
They always acting real crazy yellin' why he show off, I say

(Yea, Yea, I'm Ready Set Set, Yea, Yea, I'm Ready Go Go (4x)

[Verse 2: Carmine]

Hate is a four letter word so is rich
That's the only thing we got in common bitch
Yea I'm positive ill make deposits bitch
You should hang it up on some closet shit
What the fuck you tryna do with that
I'm pricing Hublots where the fuck is your wrist at?
That's french shit, how the fuck is your accent?
In a merci bleu coupe with the AC blasting
Fuck you because I like the words
You renting my style man you like the shirts
You can't rent my drive we ain't fuckin' hertz
My girl got more common sense then a fuckin' purse
Go to Columbia set important goals
I rather import Columbia for your fuckin' nose
Get a gold crucifix, Diamonds through his toes
On judgement day hey I'm Ready Set Go

(Yea, Yea, I'm Ready Set Set, Yea, Yea, I'm Ready Go Go (4x)

Go (15x)
