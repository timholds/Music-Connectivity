[Intro: LaZe and Booki]
Come on, ah
Yeah
Come on, let me see your hands man
Clap them hands
Clap them hands, come on
Clap them hands, yes
Clap them hands

[Verse 1: LaZe]
Standing on stage one day, ah thats my vision
Yeah, that's my motherfucking dream
No i will never ever will let it seem
I will never care whether you call it superstition
You fucking suckers won't be able to destroy this vision
Man I know I'll be the one to show to you who was wrong
Yeah, I know I'll be the one, the greatest to ever live
Just take another whiff, and listen to this "jiff" and
Come Be my guest, but don't suggest to me
That I should give up and go after money
Cause no that's not my fucking mentality
Boring and rich, thats not what I want to be
Cause what I'm doing right here is my destiny
And I won't be the one who could have had to be
No, I'll be the one who was always said to be
Yeah bro, come on and trust me, you will see that...

[Hook: LaZe and Booki]
I'll be the motherfucking greatest (4x)
You'll be the motherfucking greatest (4x)
We'll be the motherfucking greatest (4x)

[Verse 2: LaZe]
Y'all haters, raiders, soon-to-be-waiters
I'm an unpopular opinion stater
Not the usual next door neighbor
I'm the one to cut you off cut your cord, your lord
Come lets treat this like a sport, enter my fort
My mission, vision, which my spirit is in no abort
Yes life is short, so let's make the best out of this
Funny as wiz, till i collapse I will be the greatest in this buiss
Yeah, not perfect but tell me who is
I don't really know whether it is
The perfect time to be what you wanna be
Cause every time I see someone trying these
Stupid fucking dreams, it really always seems
They won't achieve a single single thing
But for me i'll be the motherfucking king ah

[Outro: Laze and Booki]
Ah, come on
Laurenzio on this beat, on this track
Booki
Yeah
