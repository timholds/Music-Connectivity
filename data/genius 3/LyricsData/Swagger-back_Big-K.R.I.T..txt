[Hook:]
Hey I'm fly, and y'all crying
You can hate me or love me but I shine
I got my swagger back, aye I got my swagger back
I got my swagger back, aye I got my swagger back
Shorty I'm paid, and I'm on
Ridin' fours slammin' Cadillac doors
I got my swagger back, aye I got my swagger back
I got my swagger back, aye I got my swagger back

[Verse 1:]
I just jumped clean and I'm feeling kind of fresh
It was thanking God that a player's so blessed
A king by air anytime anywhere
Aye a parking lot pimp so all the dying bitches stare
Yeah I'm bumpin' Big [?] just incase a nigga tussle
I'm a countrified [?] player motherfucker
I got that debonair bonafide pimpin'
Type of flow that rustling hoes into submission
Got it in the kitchen, cookin' up a feast
I'm [?] plus a underground beast
Everywhere they know me, from the burbs' to the streets
From the words in the verse to the base in the beats
Get a thick milkshake from a brawl like a lease
Chillin' with some mobsters where every word is capisce
If I get it off the the dock then I'm gettin' it for cheap
Cuz' them chump bad boys make it where you can't sleep

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Every time I'm on it, grindin' and coastin'
Ride with my nigga, first question is you smokin'
Everybody like this, why did I write this
Predictin' the future like a motherfuckin' psychic
See me on top cuz' I got what you wanted
I don't pop pills but shorty like rollin'
So I keep pourin', shorty keep twerkin'
Cadillac on [?], really really do I heard it
If she get to flirtin' really don't phase me
Hoes come and go but money is my lady
Might have my baby [?] us at the business
Investin' in the hood to bring the world to Mississippi
Show em' how I'm livin', flippin' while I'm cruisin'
Break a bitch down tell her "watch me do it do it"
This here is a movement, Krizzle is for choosin'
Ain't no way in hell a nigga like me ever losin'

[Hook:]
