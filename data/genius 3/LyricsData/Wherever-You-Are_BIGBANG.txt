Exploded on the highway
The radio kept on playing
And we were on our way

Now all i got left of you
Will be lying around for a, day or two
Its not a lot of money
Thats what they say

I like to know what youre thinking, wherever you are
You still keep me thinking, wherever you are
Did you know i was stealing?
Did you just let it pass
Wherever you are

There was a conversation
In lack of better words
I wanted the piano
But i got the picture
To go

I want to know what youre thinking, wherever you are
You still keep me thinking wherever you are
I want to know what youre thinking
I wanna know how youre breathing
Wish i could take you for offa ride
In grandpas car

-- wherever you are!
-- wherever you are!
