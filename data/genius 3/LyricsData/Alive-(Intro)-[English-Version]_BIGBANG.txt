I'm still alive, I'm still alive, I'm still alive
We seem to be died but we never die
We never hide for avoiding others' eyes

Everyday we are falling down but I'm alive
I don't have what I can lose, Putting past aside, I jump out
My figure falling down deeply is beautiful
I throw myself to the sky, I'm in freedom
As this moment, I'm still alive, I'm still alive

I’m still alive, I'm still alive, I'm still alive
I’m livin’ that, I'm livin’ that good life
I’m still alive, I'm still alive, I'm still alive
We livin’ that, we livin’ that good life
