You can't see me, you won't hear me
I'm the Nightstalker, coming to haunt you
I'm your nightmare, I'm your worst fear
I'm the Nightstalker, you know I'm here

I'm on the prowl tonight
Prey your not a victim
Cause when I hit the streets
Another one bites the dust
By the blood of demons
I walk this earth
I hope I didn't scare you
You helpless soul

I prey on your fears, it feets my strength
Your just another victim, awaiting death

You can't see me, you won't hear me
I'm the Nightstalker, coming to haunt you
I'm your nightmare, I'm your worst fear
I'm the Nightstalker, you know I'm here

Do I make you feel uneasy
Maybe a little queezy
Do I scare you maybe
Bring a chill to your bones
You'll never be the same
When you play my game
I will haunt and taunt you
Ans scare you out of your skin

I prey on your fears, it feets my strength
Your just another victim, awaiting death

You can't see me, you won't hear me
I'm the Nightstalker, coming to haunt you
I'm your nightmare, I'm your worst fear
I'm the Nightstalker, you know I'm here

I'm on the prowl tonight
Prey your not a victim
Cause when I hit the streets
Another one bites the dust
By the blood of demons
I walk this earth
I hope I didn't scare you
You helpless soul

I prey on your fears, it feets my strength
Your just another victim, awaiting death
I prey on your fears, it feets my strength
Your just another victim, awaiting death
