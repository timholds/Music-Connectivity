TokyoUh, there's no turning back
Like about face, man there's no turning back
Nothin' come easy, my nigga believe me
Fall short on my dream, how I'm supposed to do that?
I come from Chi-buya, some call it Chiraq
West side, now Bed-Stuy is where I relax
New York, but they still might smoke you like Newports
Just do like a black bitch's hair and relax
Thank God for my brothers, they always get me
Soon as I blow, man, they comin' wit' me
Stay in the buildin', is we talkin' millions?
If so I'm tryna' sell 100 [?]
Surroundings change, niggas change like Iguanas
Family first, not just mama and papa
[?], make yo' sentence like commas
This ain't no Mary J, don't stick to no drama
Nights, I would stare at the ceiling and pray up
Hopin' this shit would come easy like virgins [?]
Find out that this shit wasn't no lay up
If I want this dream, for this shit
I'm goin' stay up and grind 'til I can, fast as I can
These dudes careers be like flash in da pan
I'm anime-watchin', when [?] get to poppin'
Gon' be the most waviest blacks in Japan
Pass and advance, no I do not get old
Unless you a rebel, then peace for the low
These bitches got nerve, actin' like light skin and curt
I ain't sweatin' these hoes, they goin' be at the show
My story they may never know it
I pray to the Lord, but no church in the wild
Gettin' no younger, no Benjamin Button
Ain't waitin' for nothin', I want this shit now

[Hook]
I'm here right now, tomorrow who knows
But my heart is somewhere in Tokyo
I'm here right now, tomorrow who knows
But my heart is somewhere in Tokyo
I'm here right now, tomorrow who knows
But my heart is somewhere in Tokyo
I'm here right now, tomorrow who knows
But my heart is somewhere in Tokyo

A goldUn Ballad[Jordan Bratton]
I've never had, a pot of gold
You're too scared to jump, you could never fly
I wonder how, you stay yourself
Don't let your soul be sold, for another life
That you already been through
That you already been through
