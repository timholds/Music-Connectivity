(Death is really just a prelude, we can raise the dead
Block and Vinnie Paz the debut gonna take your head) x 2
Regardless, regardless

[Vinnie Paz]
I fucking hate God, hate everybody that worship him
You the gay rapper, put a fucking skirt on him
I'll fucking murder him; I got a great banger
I'm the opposite of love: kill, hate, anger
I'm the opposite of God love
I'm a vampire, drink blood from a wine jug
I'm a divine thug .38 you know
Vinnie Paz Brooklyn act we waiting to blow
That's probably the reason everyone hating us fo'
I wanna see bunny rabbits I'm taking your dough
I'm taking your heart, then I break it apart
I should've known that these faggots were snakes from the start
I'm amazingly smart - like Christopher Rios
You'll be swimming with the fishes Luca Brasi does
Mi gente amigos, I'm with Block McCloud
Vinnie P. Siciliano he pour the rocks in brown

[Hook]

[Block McCloud]
Be careful what you wish for, because the devil's listening
Block and Vinnie on one track it's like pure Hell is risen
Choosing to tune into this fire music self inflicted
Pure evil like that girl from The Ring in your television
Each verse is like a spell from witch's thinner
Your health is slipping, fire swells in the pit of sinners that melt your siblings
Suffer the little children of the land
Block is building a fan base that looks like the Village of the Damned
Taste the sulfur, ain't Gods to puncture like shrapnel
And make you suffer like sadist lovers- cut you like scalpels
Pluck your eyeballs with forceps, claim your firstborn unless
You pour a cup of lamb's blood on your doorsteps
Block and Vinnie Paz, the acting Jedi Minds
In a Satanic temple drinking the reddest wine
Smoking the ash of a pastor we bled mixed with ash and lamb's breath
To bring hiphop back from the dead

[Hook]
