[Verse 1]
I'll be your satellite
When you [?] alone
I know where you draw the line
I know what you draw it for
I know where you draw the line
Yeah, I know what you draw it for

[Chorus]
You got them to love you
[?] that you adore
You got angels above you
I know I love you more
I know I love you more

[Verse 2]
I'll be your satellite
Out here on my own
You know where to draw the line
I  know what you draw it for
[?]
[?] that you are

[Chorus]
You got angels above you
I know I love you more
I know I love you more
I know I love you more

[Outro]
[?] star
Out there on your own
When you're feeling [?], I'll come and make you right
When you're feeling lonely, I'll be your satellite
No one's gonna break you
No one's gonna bring you down
Nothing's gonna shake you
I'm your satellite, I'm your satellite
