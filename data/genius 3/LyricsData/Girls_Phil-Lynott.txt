Oh won't you send a letter home
To say I'm living on my own
Girls
I need someone to love
I need someone
Girls
It's true I've been telling you all these lies
And I can't understand it
Why I've been telling thee all these lies
If you know it's a fact
Then you know I want you back
Girls

I need someone it's true, I need you
Girls
It's true for me there's you
Girls
Got class, I need her fast
Girls
She's been telling me all these lies
And I can't understand it
She's been telling me all these lies
That girl don't love me no more
Oh girl

I had to write this letter
To tell you how I came to meet him
He was sweet and I loved him
Now each time we meet I can't seem to forget him
I feel so depressed

Lost love of Romeo
Casanova has finally lost out on love
I'm jealous of his past

Oh won't you send a letter home
Say I'm living on my own
Girls
I need someone to love
I need someone to love
Girls
With class, that's fast
Don't move slow
Girls
Oh no not alone oh no
Girls
For me
I've been telling you all these lies
And I can't understand it
I've been telling you all these lies
I must have been crazy
Girl
Oh girl

My dream any sadness, sorrow or gloom
Your laugh that fills the air
With the scent of the sweetest perfume

You feel so good
You just don't care
I lay awake night crying
Because my dream may not come true
You see I love you
Please this is my one and only dream

Girls
Girls
Who's fast, she's got class, she loves last
Girls
She's not slow
She won't go
She won't leave you, alone
Girls
Don't leave me alone
