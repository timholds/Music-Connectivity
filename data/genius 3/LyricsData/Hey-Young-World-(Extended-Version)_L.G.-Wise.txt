VERSE 1 (LG Wise)
Generation in a curse
And they feelin' sad
Too many shorties are in da hearse
Before they knowin they dad
How many sons will never know they daddys
So young and confused
So its the streets where they learn to live
So when they choose then they lose
Its like the day that Pac died
A place in your heart you gonna cry
I can't lie
The Lord will come and wipe da tears from yo eyes
But Jesus shed his blood to save a thug
Then they got us bustin slugs
Them haters bust his head
But he still showed em love
Its the thugs that need yo love
Its the thugs that need yo hug
Lord we need you on des streets
Thats why we dying from des slugs
So me and da Outlawz
We come father asking you for forgiveness
So you can come into our heart
And help us savin our children
Now hey young world
From Lauderdale to da Bay
Now hey young world
From MIA to L.A
Now hey young world
From Carolina to VA
Lord hear these thugs crying and come and save us today
CHORUS
To all my shorties on da blocks (hey young world)
To all the thugs slangin rocks (hey young world)
Even if you on lock down
All my ladies the world is yours
(2X)
VERSE 2 (EDI)
These days it don't pay to play
You better make your way
Cause life ain't guaranteed to you young dudes
In the wildlife
Still livin childlike
Criminal minds of the juvenilles up
