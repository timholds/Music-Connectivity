(Strider)
It's the way that you move
The way you grind
The way you groove
The way you blow my mind
The way I want you to be mine
Its my prime
Escalades with weighty on the side
Break it down, sit down unwind
To bling like this it ain't a crime
Check it
My style is off the hook
New range in the book
Action undercovers in this came I play the crook
I'm causing maniac, got you shook
Shorty take another look
And leave with me this time is mine
We're rollin out lets make it grime
(Krazy)
Oh what a night
I could have died
I've never seen a honey looking so right
The way you move
Your making moves
I love the way you shake your body like Beyonce
I think you know I wanna rol
I'm asking shorty where it is she wants to go
Tell me what I gotta do if I wanna get next to you

(Bridge)
All I wanna do is just take a ride
And show the boys what I got in the passenger side
Yeah
I wanna make you my baby
It's the thought of your lips just kissin on me
Back seat of my jeeps where I wanna be
Yeah
So won't you be my baby!

(Chorus)
Shorty
Tell me what you wanna do
Shorty
Cos I like the way you grind and move
Shorty
Baby come on what I gotta prove
Tell me how your feeling me
Cos I really wanna get with you
Shorty
Come on girl what you gotta loose
Shorty
Ain't no lies babe I speak the truth
Shorty
Hurry up chick I'm leaving soon
Tell me what I gotta do I really wanna get with you
(Spike-E)
I flow to the beat as if I'm the drums
I'm grinding on you as if you're the one
Im sitting in a click of 10 so you wanna know where I am son
Gonna hit a black benz plus some girls plus some action
I see this girl in a low cut pink dress
Im thinking to myself I might show interest
I wanna bring her ova show her how a weighty soldier gets down
It's late night but it's far from over. Ho!

(Bridge)
All I wanna do is just take a ride
And show the boys what I got in the passenger side
Yeah
I wanna make you my baby
It's the thought of your lips just kissin on me
Back seat of my jeeps where I wanna be
Yeah
So won't you be my baby!

(Chorus)
Shorty
Tell me what you wanna do
Shorty
Cos I like the way you grind and move
Shorty
Baby come on what I gotta prove
Tell me how your feeling me
Cos I really wanna get with you
Shorty
Come on girl what you gotta loose
Shorty
Ain't no lies babe I speak the truth
Shorty
Hurry up chick I'm leaving soon
Tell me what I gotta do I really wanna get with you
(Melo-D)
I'm so melo no one else compares
Im thinking about getting on you tonight
Gonna take you somewhere
Where we could
Maybe be alone
Slip into the zone
Coz I've been watching you
And now my mind won't leave you alone
I never though a girl could completely take over my mind
It's insane the way my brains got you locked inside
But for real though
I never felt like this before
But you should know
My feelings for you will stay pure
(Rocky)
Jumpin in my hummer mumma
Lets do a runner runner
Go on a shopping spree
And goto dolce and gabanna
You say you got a man
But you don't understand
There ain't no baby gonna love you like rocky can
(Flava)
We can roll around
May be hit the town
But maybe baby I can show
You how we get down
(Krazy)
So baby tell me whats the deal if I wanna get next to you babe

(Chorus x2)
Shorty
Tell me what you wanna do
Shorty
Cos I like the way you grind and move
Shorty
Baby come on what I gotta prove
Tell me how your feeling me
Cos I really wanna get with you
Shorty
Come on girl what you gotta loose
Shorty
Ain't no lies babe I speak the truth
Shorty
Hurry up chick I'm leaving soon
Tell me what I gotta do I really wanna get with you
