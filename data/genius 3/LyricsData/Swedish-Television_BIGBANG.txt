Hello
Can anyone find me now?
Well I don't think so
And man
If you would really wanna hurt me you did it now
Oooohhh
I can take alot, but I just about had enough
You should see me now

Tryin' to remember the warmth from her fathers hands
(aaahhh aaahhh ahhhh)
But now its all about you coming home from the track
All she can't think of is you... not looking back
The billboards of the moon light alot better then she thought they would
Now I know she can't take it anymore

Her feelings still grow here without you
But she can still feel your blows talking to herself now
With your brown turtleneck sweather
Just to spite the world
Like a living room collision
On swedish television some time ago..

But now its all about you coming home from the track
All she can think of is you.. not looking back
The billboards of the moon light alot better then she thought They Would
Trying to remember the warmth of a fathers hand

But now its all about you coming home from the track
All she can think of is you.. not looking back
Trying to remember the warmth of a fathers hand
Now I knows she can't take it anymore
