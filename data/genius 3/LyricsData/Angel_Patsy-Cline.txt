I can see an angel walking (walking)
Someone else is by his side (by his side)
I can hear an angel talking (talking)
And he looks so satisfied (satisfied)

I can see an angel smiling (smiling)
By his side I'll never be (never be)
In my heart I'll go on crying (crying)
Only tears are left for me (left for me)

Time will change many things
New seasons will come and go
But I will never change
All my life I'll love him so

I can see an angel laughing (laughing)
He's the one that I adore (I adore)
I will always keep on hiding (hiding)
All my love forever more (ever more)

(Time will change many things)

He's the one that I adore (I adore)
