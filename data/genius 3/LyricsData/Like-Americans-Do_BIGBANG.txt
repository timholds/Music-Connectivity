[Verse]
If your heart breaks
Tear it apart
If your mind fails
Give it a start

Everything you need
Underneath your shoe
Pick up the pieces
And fix it with glue

[Chorus]
Believe in the dream
Like Americans do

[Verse]
If you lost your job
Tell me about it
Had a sweet drunken father
Shout it out

Old scars make this friendship true
I’m not too proud to wait for you

[Chorus]
Or to believe in this
Like Americans do

[Verse]
Love is lonely
Like a Saturday night
Or your Sundays best
Torn in a fight

Dancing with mirrors to the devils tunes
Loners in the neon just a chosen few

[Chorus]
Believing they’re saved
Like Americans do

[Verse]
If your heart breaks
Tear it apart
If your mind fails
Give it a start

Everything you need
Underneath your shoe
I’m not too proud to wait for you

[Chorus]
Or to believe in this
Or pretend to
Like Americans do

[Verse]
Love is lonely
Like a Saturday night
Or your Sundays best
Torn in a fight

Dancing with mirrors to the devils tunes
Loners in the neon just a chosen few

[Chorus]
Believing they’re saved
Believing they’re saved
Like Americans do
