Yo
Baby girl, are you missin me
Cos I'm still missin you
All
I'm just calling to say that I'm really really missing you girl
Still wanna be part of your world
I gotta let you know
That I can't let go
Its kinda lonely baby
Flava
I think I need you more then life itself
But I ain't about to put down the mike for a girl
I'm feeling your pain
I still just the same
Just one difference
I'm flava you still love James
Pick up the phone
Coz I know you wanna speak
Its been a week
I ain't a creep
Fulfilled your needs and fantasies
Just like the old times
Remember the old rhymes
On the cold streets we first meet
Seemed so right
All
And it don't matter what your friends may say
Coz I still think about you everyday
And I just wanna get close to you
Tell me what I gotta do girl
I'm just calling to say that I'm really really missing you girl
Still wanna be part of your world
I gotta let you know
That I can't let go
Its kinda lonely baby
I wanted to say I'm still thinking about you everyday
I wanna see your pretty smile again
I gotta let you know
Still thinking bout you no I can't let go
Spike-e
I've got something to say
Times we chilled together held each other slipping away
And now I feel that I can't hold another
Missing each day now there's no one here to run to cover
Missing you babe now I feel I never find another lover
Missing your ways and every day is the same
It rains sitting here lonely feeling rage and pain
But if you come back soon babe
Times don't change
Ill always be here and here I'll stay
And it don't matter what your friends may say
Coz I still think about you everyday
And I just wanna get close to you
Tell me what I gotta do girl
All
I'm just calling to say that I'm really really missing you girl
Still wanna be part of your world
I gotta let you know
That I can't let go
Its kinda lonely baby
I wanted to say I'm still thinking about you everyday
I wanna see your pretty smile again
I gotta let you know
Still thinking bout you no I can't let go
Krazy
There's only one thing I've got to say
That is that I'll miss you every day
We were made for each other
I know I was wrong I'm still thinking about ya
I want to know what I did wrong
All I know is a got to stay strong
I need you I want you I need you to hold
Baby won't you come back home
All
I'm just calling to say that I'm really really missing you girl
Still wanna be part of your world
I gotta let you know
That I can't let go
Its kinda lonely baby
I wanted to say I'm still thinking about you everyday
I wanna see your pretty smile again
I gotta let you know
Still thinking bout you no I can't let go
I'm just calling to say that I'm really really missing you girl
Still wanna be part of your world
I gotta let you know
That I can't let go
Its kinda lonely baby
I wanted to say I'm still thinking about you everyday
I wanna see your pretty smile again
I gotta let you know
Still thinking bout you no I can't let go
