[Chorus 1]
Way gone for my sweet baby
So strong and I don't mean maybe
If I'm wrong then I don't know nothing
'Cause I'm way gone for her sweet loving

[Verse 1]
Way gone she's my one and only
So long to sad and lonely
She waltzed into my world
Now I'm way gone for my sweet girl

[Chorus 2]
Oh if I'm half the man
My sweet baby thinks I am
I guess I better pack my bags
'Cause I don't plan on coming back

[Verse 2]
Way gone and I've crossed over
I'm lucky as a four leaf clover
I don't want nobody to save me
'Cause I way gone for my sweet baby

[Chorus 2]

[Verse 3]
Way gone she's a one-way ticket
Rock on gonna get down with it
Sweet lips and brunette curls
Yes I'm way gone for my sweet girl

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
Way gone - for my sweet baby
Way gone - and I don't mean maybe
Rock on - Time to get down with it
Way gone
