Feat. Da Gents

Lady...

(Montell) (Da Gents)
You don't understand the physical attraction
Between a (woman and a man)
A woman and a man
See, you don't need to man to be
(Calling you) calling you
(Spoiling you) spoiling you
You wanna have a good time
And tonight it's all about you

1 - (Da Gents)
We don't have to be lovers
We don't have to be friends
All I wanna do baby, is hit the skins

(Montell)
Cuz I, I, I, I...

2 - (Montell and Da Gents)
I wanna get laid, it ain't about love tonight
It ain't about love, all of the time
I wanna get laid, it ain't about love tonight
It ain't about love, all of the time

(Montell)
Baby, baby
You don't need no commitment
If it's me you wanna get with
Then let me in, let me in
And show me a little skin
And get laid for the hell of it
For the taste, for the touch
For the smell of it
Don't you be ashamed
I don't even have to know your name

Repeat 1
Repeat 2

(Montell)
Take it to the breakdown...

(Da Gents) (Montell)
Every hour of every day
Every second of every minute
(Said I want you)
I wanna get laid
(Said I lust for you)
I wanna get laid
I wanna...

(Montell)
See you naked in the raw (what?)
I'm takin' off your bra (right)
Wassup y'all?
See (I wanna) see dem panties hit da floor (now)
Leave 'em at da door (ta-dow!)
Ya can't move slow, cuz baby
(I wanna) hit the saddle
Now I'm ridin', ridin' on your backside
And then (I'm gonna) get my roll on deep
I'm deep into a coma like sleep
I got laid

Repeat 2 to fade
