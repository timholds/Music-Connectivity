I end up too weak to fake it;
And you just suggest I throw it all away
Giving up too many afternoons;
Now to groping for some apparition
When I should just be getting back to you

Open up; How can I open up?
I'm going to be like you as soon as the voices stop
Here's someone I never met before
Where the clown invites the clown
I'll take you down and down and down;
Remember we go

Sooner or later, sooner or later
I will change and we will be all right

Sooner or later, sooner or later
I will change and we will be all right

Never asked for an apology;
You know I don't believe in mixed emotions
I can see we can't control the world;
With your voice now front and back of me
I think you had me confused with the man who lost his nerve;
The man who fell to Earth
