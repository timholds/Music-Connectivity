[Hook]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

[Verse 1]
Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick
And kicks it quick; you know how black niggas get
With the hoods, fatigues with the boots with trees
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, making crazy G's
Hitting buckshots at niggas that open spots
On the avenue--take my loot, and I'm bagging you
Pimping hoes that drive Volvos and Rodeos
Flash the roll, make her wet in her pantyhose
Damn, a nigga's style is unorthodox
Grip the Glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks
Just in case a nigga want to act out
I just black out, and blow they motherfucking back out
That's a real nigga for ya

[Hook]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

[Verse 2]
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths
Just in case Dread want to riff
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very
Not your ordinary: we watch you get buried
That's a real nigga for ya
Get mad, do a quarter, flip the script, and rip your lawyer
Spit at the DA, cause fuck what she say
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway
Up north, bound first stop for the town
Of Fishkill, where the hand skills are real ill
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover
Ha-Hah! Yo G, pass the buddha

[Hook]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

[Hook]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

[Verse 3]
Money, hoes, and clothes
Blunt smoke coming out the nose, is all a nigga knows
Flipping on foes, putting tags on toes
Watching the stash grow, clocking the cashflow
The neighborhood gravedigger
Getting paid so much, all the bitches want to see a nigga
I guess they figure I'm paid, I want to get laid
Or since I got loot, I want to knock boots
I'd rather beat my dick than trick
And if she don't suck, then we don't fuck
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck
Yes, flex after two or three Becks
As I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?
A fly guy? Well fuck it, I'm the high guy
From Bed-Stuy, putting the swelling on your eye
And your nose even; when I choke ya, you stop breathing
And when Jake come, I'm leaving

[Hook]
To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)

To all my Brooklyn (Niggas!)
To all my Uptown (Niggas!)
To all my Bronx (Niggas!)
To all my Queensbridge (Niggas!)
(Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!)
