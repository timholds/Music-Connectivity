[Hook:]
Everyone's got a bicycle but me
Cruising down the avenue, like feathers on the sea
Everyone's got a bicycle but me
It's so unsettling
Unsettling

[Verse One:]
I don’t know what happened, she don’t know it either
I’m sitting in the water under the bridge with Aretha
Frankly it’s a problem; I’m seeing all the pain
This isn’t a pond, it’s a bucket holding rain
I’m looking at the bottom, there’s a hole, I’m feeling the same way
I’m hoping on tomorrow, but slipping through the day
I gather all my thoughts in a collection
These wet slippery days are the ones that I hold on to with protection
Reminds me of a time when I was younger
Feasting on the thought I call strength, but never solving any hunger
Who could be the one to come and save me?
Will you put in any effort? Or pass and just go half on a baby?
Man… Positive for sadness… Black bile
And my friends say it’s over due to wack style
I’m not the only one treading on the path
We’re all in the same float, I speak on our behalf

[Hook:]
Everyone's got a bicycle but me
(I’m on my own, they tell me I’m on my own)
Cruising down the avenue, like feathers on the sea
Everyone's got a bicycle but me
(I’m on my own, they tell me I’m on my own)
It's so unsettling
Unsettling

[Verse Two:]
I call lonely these nights that I pray for the unnoticed
The thinkers and the poets who were forced to flow soulless
Girls are aiming the highest but get trapped within the lowest
Of the men who claim closest, but never stay focused
I’m a dry wall away from being knocked down, taken out
Even the truth will be wondering what the fake’s about
I wish it was easy to live happily
Instead of sleeping with a never-ending agony
Hurts seeing the pain reach it’s pivotal
Like a novel at the end the way the text does
And even if the ending isn’t visible
I’ll think of the same daydream that L.E.X does
Next to me is an empty chair, nothing’s there
I’m flying solo on the ground, so people stop and stare
And they walk away and leave me never feeling right
I’m all on my own, and I’m feeling like

[Hook:]
Everyone's got a bicycle but me
(I’m on my own, they tell me I’m on my own)
Cruising down the avenue, like feathers on the sea
Everyone's got a bicycle but me
(I’m on my own, they tell me I’m on my own)
It's so unsettling
Unsettling

[End Verse:]
But what is there to do
When you know that you've been a fool
By the rainiest of summer?
Rainiest day of summer

Just when you decide
You wanna take a little step outside
You get plummeted by the downpour
On the rainiest day of summer

I’m not the only one treading on the path

I’m not the only one treading on the path
We’re all in the same float, I speak on our behalf
