[Verse 1]
Not that long ago, seems like yesterday
We were caught up in love, we were swept away
Seems like overnight, from out of the blue
Somethin' went wrong, between me an' you

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll move on, I'll be strong
Do what I have to do
No matter where you are, you'll always have my heart
I may never get over you

[Verse 2]
A hopeless dream's, insanity
I'm just a fool with a fantasy
I close my eyes, I feel your touch
Just as real, as it ever was

[Chorus]
I'll move on, I'll be strong
Do what I have to do
No matter where you are, you're always on my heart
I may never get over you

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Yeah, I'll move on, I'll be strong
Do what I have to do
No matter where you are, you're always on my heart
I may never get over... you
