Living your life in a fool's paradise
And that's not for me
I tell you, yeah
A point of society
Living your life in a fool's paradise
But what can I do

I didn't make this world
I was only born
That's everybody's attitude
Who's life was torn, oh
(Life) is not what you make it
That's what the upper class make a sense of you
Well (come on, come on now)
People, open up your minds
'Cause this is what you wanna do

Living your life in a fool's paradise
And that's not for me
I tell you, yeah
A point of society
Living your life in a fool's paradise
It's part of growing up

A child shows much perception
But he's pointing the finger
In full spite of profit and bogetters
Who strives for more, oh oh
More money, more power, more security
He stays so empty insde
So busy trying to get ahead
That he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
That he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
That he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
Except for

Living your life in a fool's paradise
And that's not for me
I tell you, yeah
A point of society
Living your life in a fool's paradise
If there's some people choose
Who's life they're willing to lose
But never
Will they fight their own war

That he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
That he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
That he starts forgetting how to live, live, live
