Yeah, yeah, yeah!

[Hook: Travis Porter]
I say my beat (beat) loud (loud)
Smokin' on that lour (lour)
Got a nigga finna turned up can't turn me down (can't turn me down)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million... (a million)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million...
(Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!)

[Verse 1: Marcus Manchild]
Okay my beat loud like a band up in it
Kickers kickin' like it's Jackie Chan up in it
I got the slav no ceilin' 2 bad hoes in it
Can't tell me shit, I'm the man, you get it
I got the bass turned up past 20
Parkin' lot pimpin' tryna get some bitches with me
Black on black, you can't see me ridin' in it
Cause I got the windows tinted
Nigga mind yo business
And then I hop and drive that 6 trey
Juiced up like OJ
But I'm from the AC not from the A
Boy I reside where Big Moe stay
So I walk straight past that crowd
Got 10 blunts that's full of that lour
Now I'm at the bar finna drink right now
I'm so turned up can't turn me down

[Hook]
I say my beat (beat) loud (loud)
Smokin' on that lour (lour)
Got a nigga finna turned up can't turn me down (can't turn me down)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million... (a million)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million...

I say my jewels loud (loud)
Juiced up in the crowd (crowd)
Got a nigga finna turned up can't turn me down (can't turn me down)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million... (a million)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million...

[Verse 2: Marcus Manchild]
I say I pulled up
Chevy to the front and put the roof up
Yelling "I'ma try and like do something"
From the city that originated 2 cups, I'm screwed up
Like wait up, go on get the waiter
Ya I already know what ya boy finna order
They know what I need when they see they say I'm G
And I got Big K.R.I.T. and my homie Travis Porter
Then I told em that I walked through the crowd straight loud with the juice
Bring more ice cause well wanna deuce
What I really want is some more of that patron and a lil' more ciroc a lil' more goose
Like hold up damn what I'm on
Trey feelin' how I'm feelin'?
Cause I'm really feelin' myself and myself feelin' like a million!

[Hook]
I say my beat (beat) loud (loud)
Smokin' on that lour (lour)
Got a nigga finna turned up can't turn me down (can't turn me down)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million... (a million)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million...

I say my jewels loud (loud)
Juiced up in the crowd (crowd)
Got a nigga finna turned up can't turn me down (can't turn me down)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million... (a million)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million...

(Yo, yo, yo! Big K.R.I.T.)

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T.]
Hey yo I'll be there in a minute, won't be long
I got a chevy heavy metal on chrome
And them hoes they won't leave me alone
Original and you lookin' like a clone
At the tippy top, wanna supersize?
And only pretty chicks be welcome inside
They be so hot in here they hollerin' bye bye
Sky high, we're now fly
And when we through we droppin' down to the trees
I told 'em see me at the top in a minute
And ain't no plan when we bumpin' inside
Who woulda thought they'd get it live on the grind
I gotta DJ with a DJ in the lamb
I holla ho, they holla back
And any country that we party that we...
That nigga trippin' cause trilly how it goes

[Hook]
I say my beat (beat) loud (loud)
Smokin' on that lour (lour)
Got a nigga finna turned up can't turn me down (can't turn me down)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million... (a million)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million...

I say my jewels loud (loud)
Juiced up in the crowd (crowd)
Got a nigga finna turned up can't turn me down (can't turn me down)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million... (a million)
I'm feelin' like a million (a million)
A million...
