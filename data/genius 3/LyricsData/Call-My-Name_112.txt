Ooh, call my name
Whenever you need my love
Whoa, baby call my name
Whenever you need my love

The time has come
Baby, I know you have someone
Who won't give you love, oh no
Just let him go and soon the pain will pass
Baby I'm gonna be there tonight
Won't you just call my name

Ooh, call my name
Whenever you need my love
Baby I'm gonna be there tonight
If you just call my name
Whoa, baby call my name
Whenever you need my love
My love

I understand baby your hurtin'
So take my hand
Your wish is my command
I'll show you how to turn that hurt around
Baby I'm gonna be there tonight
Ooh, just call my name

Ooh, call my name
Whenever you need my love
Ooh yeah, just call my name
Whoa, baby call my name
Whenever you need my love
My love

Girl you need someone
Who can give you what you need tonight
(I know you're hurtin')
I know you're hurtin
But my love will make you feel so right
He said he loves you but
I tell you that it's only a lie
I'll do so many things
If only you would call me
Baby, baby

Girl you need someone
Who can give you what you need tonight
I know you're hurtin
But my love will make you feel so right
He said he loves you but
I tell you that it's only a lie
I'll do so many things
If only you will call me
Baby, just call me

Ad lib until fade
