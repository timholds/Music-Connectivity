[Verse 1]
Overhead the albatross hangs motionless upon the air
And deep beneath the rolling waves in labyrinths of coral caves
The echo of a distant tide comes willowing across the sand
And everything is green and submarine

[Chorus 1]
And no one showed us to the land
And no one knows the where's or why's
But something stirs and something tries
Starts to climb towards the light

[Verse 2]
Strangers passing in the street
By chance two separate glances meet
And I am you and what I see is me
And do I take you by the hand
And lead you through the land
And help me understand the best I can?

[Chorus 2]
And no one calls us to move on
And no one forces down our eyes
No one speaks and no one tries
No one flies around the sun

[4:56 - 19:11 - Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Cloudless every day you fall
Upon my waking eyes
Inviting and inciting me to rise
And through the window in the wall
Come streaming in on sunlight wings
A million bright ambassadors of morning

[Chorus 3]
And no one sings me lullabies
And no one makes me close my eyes
So I throw the windows wide
And call to you across the sky
