I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
I can tell ‘bout the night tales and the dry spells
All the wrong ones and the right things to stay away from
And how we took off and how we on top
And how we won’t fall, how we going up
Or how we came up, or how we came up
It all started in the basement
Was an attic but we called that shit the basement
Bass used to break all my momma’s vases
Unc shot my first 8 then nigga I probably wasn’t eight then
Always had the gas like I broke wind
They said my way of making dollars never made sense
Come take a dive, a waterfall in the deep end
I can tell you ‘bout the nights out in Fort Bend

[Hook: Travis Scott]
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
No you don’t tell

[Verse 2: Travis Scott]
Yeah, I can tell ‘bout the night tales
And all the dry wells, and all the long roads
And all my ideas before the cornrows
How we came up and how we came down
Going donuts, coffee couldn’t help now
How we zoned out, made it out the wood now
And what it do when they wanna be your friend now
How to get it, how to live and get it in now
How to go from scrappin' pockets, making his demands now
I been impulsive, non-emotional, staying humble ‘bout it
Tilt the posture, sick, pass the bottle
Five-o-four hot boys, minus the bad rap like Silkk the Shocker
But I'ma pull up the silk, to shock her with the silk
Nigga you know I been a rocker, dripping milk and knockers
Take it up another notcher, take it up another notcher
I top a, pop a pill, pop a seal to forget about you
I’ll bumbaclot you, bumba bumba blocka shot you
Bling and bang, a bang a rapper
Bangarang, I brought my money back
Orangutan diamonds hangin' on my neng-a-lang
Bitches hanging on my dang-a-lang

[Hook: Travis Scott]
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
You ain't told no tales, you ain't told no tales
I can tell baby, I can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
How bout I come over there
I can tell baby, I can tell
All of them bitches can tell
I can tell baby, I can tell
All of them bitches can tell
No you don’t tell
