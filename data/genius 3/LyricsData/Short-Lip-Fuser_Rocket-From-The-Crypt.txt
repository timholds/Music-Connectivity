Watch it slip, watch it slide
I bet ten dollars on the losing horse
Feel my grip, of my gripe
Watch me do it again

Where's my dinner?

One of these days
You're gonna be sorry
One of these days
You're gonna get beat (Hey)
One of these days
Right before you
One of these days
You'll fall asleep (Hey)

One of these days
You're gonna get beat yeah

Feel my grip, of my gripe
I bet ten dollars on the losing horse
Watch it slip, watch it slide
Watch me do it again

Where's my dinner?

One of these days
You're gonna be sorry
One of these days
You're gonna get beat (Hey)
One of these days
Right before you
One of these days
You'll fall asleep (Hey)

One of these days
You're gonna get beat yeah
