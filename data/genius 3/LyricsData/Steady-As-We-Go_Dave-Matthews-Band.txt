[Verse 1]
I'll walk halfway around the world
Just to sit down by your side
And I would do most anything girl
To be the apple of your eye

[Chorus]
Troubles they may come and go
But good times they are the gold
So if this road gets rocky girl
Just steady as we go

[Verse 2]
Any place you want to go
You know I'll be next to you
If it's treasure baby you're looking for
I'll search the whole world through

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
When the storm comes
You shelter me
When I don't say a word
And you know exactly what I mean
In the darkest times
You shine on me
You set me free
And keep me steady as we go

[Bridge]
So if your heart wrings dry my love
I will fill your cup
And if your load gets heavy girl
I will lift you up

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ah
Hold me
Shine on me
Oh, shine, shine
Shine on me
Shine, shine
Yeah, shine on me
Hey, shine
