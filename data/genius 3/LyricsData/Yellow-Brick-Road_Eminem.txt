[Intro]
"What we have to do is deal with it when these individuals are young enough, if you will, to be saved, not in a religious sense, but not to constitute what this country at times calls their throwaway children."
"We seem to be approaching an age of the gross." {burp}
"We all have this idea that we should move up a little bit from our parents' nation and each generation should do a little bit better."

[Verse 1]
Alright, come on, let's cut the bullshit, enough
Let's get it started, let's start addressin' this issue, and open it up
Let's take this shit back to the basement
And we can discuss statements that's made on this tape and
Its whole origin of the music that we all know and love
The music that we all enjoy
The music you accuse me of tryin' to destroy
Let's rewind it to '89 when I was a boy
On the east side of Detroit, crossin' 8 Mile into Warren
Into hick territory; I'd like to share a story
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me
You have well informed me, I am well-aware
That I don't belong here: you've made that perfectly clear
I get my ass kicked damn near everywhere
From Bel-Aire shopping center just for stopping in there
From the black side all the way to the white side
Okay, there's a bright side, a day that I might slide
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin' my ass
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks
Oh, them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks
Them good old notorious so well known tracks

[Hook]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home

[Verse 2]
I'd roam the streets so much they'd call me a drifter
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike
Just to get picked up to get me a lift to
8 Mile and Van Dyke and steal a goddamn bike
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park
That was the halfway mark, to meet Kim, had to walk
Back to her mama's on Chalmers after dark
To sneak me in the house when I'm kicked out my Mom's
That's about the time I first met Proof
With Goofy Gary on the steps
At Osbourne, handin' out some flyers
He was doin' some talent shows at Center Line High
I had told him to stop by and check this out sometime
He looked at me like I'm out my mind
Shook his head, like, "White boys don't know how to rhyme."
I spit out a line and rhymed "birthday" with "first place"
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit
With compound syllables sound combined
From that day we was down to ride
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line

[Hook]
So, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road
As we go on another episode
Journey with me as I take you through this nifty little place
That I once used to call home sweet home
Come on, let's go back, follow the yellow brick road

[Verse 3]
My first year in 9th grade, can't forget that day at school
It was cool 'til your man MC Shan came through
He said that Puma's the brand ‘cause the Klan makes Troops
It was rumors, but man, goddamn, they flew
Musta been true, because man, we done banned they shoes
I had the new ones, the Cool J, Ice Lamb, suede too
But we just threw 'em in the trash like they yesterday's news
Guess who came through next?
X Clan debuted, Professor X (vanglorious)
Exists in a state of red, black and green, with a key, sissies!
Now with this being a new trend, we don't fit in
Crackas is out with Cactus albums, blackness is in
African symbols and medallions represent Black Power
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard
And Butta would go to the mall
With 'em all over our necks like we're showin 'em off
Not knowin' at all we was being laughed at
"You ain't even half black!
You ain't 'posed to have that, homie, let me grab that!
And that Flavor Flav clock, we gon' have to snatch that!"
All I remember is meeting back at Manix's basement
Sayin' how we hate this
How racist but dope the X Clan's tape is
Which reminds me, back in '89, me
And Kim broke up for the first time; she was tryna two-time me
And there was this black girl at our school
Who thought I was cool
‘Cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein' me
And oh the irony, guess what her name was?
Ain't even goin' say it, plus, the same color hair as hers
Was and blue contacts and a pair of jugs
The bombest goddamn girl in our whole school
If I could pull her, not only would I become more popular
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the
Same time; but it backfired
I was supposed to dump her but she dumped me for this black guy
And that's the last I ever seen or heard
Or spoke to the "Oh Foolish Pride" girl
But I've heard people say they heard the tape and it ain't that bad
But it was: I singled out a whole race
And for that I apologize, I was wrong
‘Cause no matter what color a girl is, she's still a ho
