You tell yourself you're happy here
And never mind the cost
You hide beneath your shallow fear
Deny your life is lost
The tension starts to wear on you
Your mind's in disarray
The things you feel are out of time
With all the words you say

The world is dark and heavy
And it leans on you, it leans on you

Listen to what I say
I always have my way
When I say move, you move
When I say jump, you jump

Now all your hopes go dirty grey
Your love becomes a chore
You've watched it all just drift away
No surprises left in store
The window ledge is calling you
Your mind's in a disarray
The way out seems so simple now
In the cold, cold lift of day

The world is dark and heavy
And it leans on you, it leans on you

Listen to what I say
I always have my way
When I say move, you move
When I say jump, you jump

Jump, I said jump
So jump

The world is dark and heavy
And it leans on you, it leans on you
The world is dark and heavy
And it leans on you, it leans on you
The world is rough and jagged
And it tears you up, it tears you up
The world is rough and jagged
And it tears you up, it tears you up
