I'm so sick and tired
Of all these things
That drag me down
I've got no where to go
They say that life
Is in these hands
You give everything
You give yourself away you give
And still you choke
And find yourself running for the door

Come and take me
Home
Lead me to your door
Take me where you are
Lead me to your door
At least just for a while

It's some kind of life
Forever days
We're in the cold
Unfamiliar way
So take this fear
And fade it out
It won't make me sad
Cause I get sentimental lord
In other ways
And I don't want to let me down here anymore

So come and take me home
Lead me to your door
Take me where you are
Lead me to your door
And let me in
Just let me in
And let me leave
Just let me leave this world
Come on now let me leave this world
At least just for a while
