[Verse 1]
I devoted all my love and all my time
More than anyone before, now others tried
To gain my love but [?] love even more
Now changes, changes

[Chorus 1]
Changes
Why are you putting me through changes, baby?
Changes
Your love has truly really really changed, babe, yeah

[Verse 2]
You say you wanna try because deep in your heart
You know that I'm the one, baby
Put your mind at ease and give your heart tranquility
Now changes, changes

[Chorus 1]
Changes
Why are you putting me through changes, baby?
Changes
Your love has truly really really changed, babe, yes

[Refrain]
You say that your feelings for me have truly changed
'Cause I'm in love, I cannot stay the same
And this is why my heart cannot accept this change, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Changes
And now I'm afraid to ever fall in love again, yeah
Changes
And now I'm afraid to ever fall in love again

[Refrain]
You say that your feelings for me have truly changed
'Cause I'm in love, I cannot stay the same
And this is why my heart cannot accept this change, yeah

[Chorus 2]
Changes
And now I'm afraid to ever fall in love again, yeah
Changes
And now I'm afraid to ever fall in love again

Could it be that you realize
That I'm not the one that you thought I'd be
Somebody tell me
Could it be that you realize
That I'm not the one that you thought I'd be
Ooh baby, oh baby
Could it be that you realize
That I'm not the one that you thought I'd be
Truly really really, truly really really
Could it be that you realize
That I'm not the one that you thought I'd be

[Outro]
