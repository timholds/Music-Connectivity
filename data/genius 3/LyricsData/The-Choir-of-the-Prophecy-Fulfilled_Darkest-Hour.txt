When the screams can't carry far enough
When the sands of time burn razor marks
When the ice burns cold and I can feel no more
I'll know, I'll know
When the screams can't carry far enough
When the sands of time burn razor marks
When the ice burns cold and I can feel no more
I'll know, I'll know

I've seen this all before
I've felt this way before
I've heard this song before
Before
I've seen this all before
I've felt this way before
I've heard this song before
Before

All this sings the prophecy
As the burning bridge falls out from under me
All this sings
All this sings
All this sings the choir of the prophecy fulfilled

When the screams can't carry far enough
When the sands of time burn razor marks
When the ice burns cold and I can feel no more
I'll know, I'll know
When the screams can't carry far enough
When the sands of time burn razor marks
When the ice burns cold and I can feel no more
I'll know, I'll know

I've seen this all before
I've felt this way before
I've heard this song before
Before
I've seen this all before
I've felt this way before
I've heard this song before

All this sings the prophecy
As the burning bridge falls out from under me
All this sings
All this sings
All this sings the choir of the prophecy fulfilled
Fulfilled

On bent knees of shame
Face down in the tears
Waiting for the waiting to strike
To strike me down
On bent knees of shame
Face down in the tears
Waiting for the waiting to strike
And strike me down

When the screams can't carry far enough
When the sands of time burn razor marks
When the ice burns cold and I can feel no more
I'll know, I'll know
When the screams can't carry far enough
When the sands of time burn razor marks
When the ice burns cold and I can feel no more
I'll know, I'll know

I'll know
I'll know, I'll know
I'll know
I'll know it's happened again
I'll know
I'll know it's happened again
I'll know
I'll know it's happened again
It's happened again
It's happened again
I'll know
I'll know it's happened again
I'll know
I'll know it's happened again
