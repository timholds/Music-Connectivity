[Hook]
Na na na na na
Naaaaa No
Naaaaa naaaa no (x2)

[Verse 1]
The sand loves when
The waves come
The sky can't wait
For the light of the sun


[Bridge]
So how could you
Look me in my eye and not see what
What I feel inside
Tell me how could you
Doubt the fact that I
I love you
I love you

Don't you ever think like that
Don't you ever, never do that
There will never be two things
That go together better than you and me

North needs South
East needs West
And no needs yes, yes, yes
Up needs down
Life needs death
And no needs yes, yes, yes

[Hook]
I need you
I need you
I need you
You
I need you, hey

[Bridge]

[Hook]
I need you
Oh baby, I need you
(Na naaaaa naaaa)
Everyday, I need you
(Na naaaaa naaaa)
You, I need you
(Na naaaaa naaaa)

(Hey hey hey)
I need you
(Na naaaaa naaaa)
Said I need you, baby
(Hey Hey Hey)
Like the desert needs the rain
Like joy needs pain
(Hey Hey Hey)
