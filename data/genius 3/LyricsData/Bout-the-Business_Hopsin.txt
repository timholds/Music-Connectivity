[Intro]
Seems like yesterday when a nigga had no luck
Seems like yesterday when a nigga had no bucks
Seems like yesterday when the world didn't give no fucks
And yesterday, after yesterday, and today I'm

[Verse 1]
These bitches know I'm the man
After the break up I gotta be, started Undercover Prodigy
I've been in counselling, sermons in churches
But still they can't get these fucking demons outta me
What's my philosophy? How'd I get the world to rock with me?
How'd I get this killing following?
How'd I go from being no one in Panorama City to being famous and boggling everyone's mind?
I don't go to bed as early, I be up all night up until 7:30 in the morning
My legacy legendary, you will never catch a nigga stepping dirty
I know God has got me, I don't ever worry
I get it by any means necessary
The haters want my career dead and buried, that's a long shot fuckin' Stephen Curry
Bitch I know, I done revived my whole plan
Fuck the matrix, I had to break it and now I'm the program
You won't ever catch me bowin' down in the eyes of no man
Why should I be co-dependent? Mothafucka I'm the golden ticket
This is my show and you don't get no admission
You won't survive a head-on collision
Man, I'm so committed I done broke a business what's the business the new U-P coalition
Got you, eyeing all of this dough I'm gettin', pussy
Niggas do not get no percentage when it's time to rock
I'm the coldest with it
So don't ever question it, it is evident
Just when you thought a nigga fell off
I am back from the dead again, I am The Revenant

[Pre-Hook]
Man, life is a struggle, you know what it be like (for real)
So I gotta get it, I'm sure you can see why (I do)
If niggas ain't eating we hitting the green light
I'm bout to put on for eight-eighteen like

[Hook]
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (I got 'em talkin' lately)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (A nigga popping lately)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (I see you watchin' baby)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (A nigga popping ain't he)

[Verse 2]
My life isn't the same, why would it be?
I got haters who thinkin' so crookedly
I'm fed up, I said fuck it and took a leap
Now I'm killing shit, my nigga, look at me (damn)
A boss in the building got niggas cryin' steady, caught in they feelings
I'm like a deadly roman dog in the village
It's fuck 'em all if they involved with the villain
I shit on anything you thought was appealin'
I hope you eatin' with the pay increased
I be feastin' just to say the least
I might flee away and take a freak
Out to Fiji maybe stay a week
Maybe three, shit I'm debatin' geez
All the problems when you makin' cheese, nigga
I'mma reinvent the eight-eighteen, God damn it
I'm sorry I had to stunt
Sometimes I'm a massive cunt
I clown niggas and I laugh a bunch
Talk shit when I grab my nuts
I'm DMing and all the ratchet sluts
My story doesn't happen much
I backed off now I'm back for lunch
I pack a punch, get active chump
You probably had to hunch
I do best when I'm mad as fuck
I'm mad corrupt, this accurate
Man, I couldn't see myself stuck in the trench
I just had to give it one hundred percent
Man I couldn't live with myself knownin' all this time I been on this planet wasn't for shit
Shout out to all the fans who been holding me down ever since day one
Keepin' my name up, FV is bankrupt and the Prodigy came up

[Pre-Hook]
Man, life is a struggle, you know what it be like (for real)
So I gotta get it, I'm sure you can see why (I do)
If niggas ain't eating we hitting the green light
I'm bout to put on for eight-eighteen like

[Hook]
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (I got 'em talkin' lately)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (A nigga popping lately)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (I see you watchin' baby)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (A nigga popping ain't he)

[Bridge]
Fuck any nigga who try to kill what I'm doin' here
I've been up for nights just tryna keep this shit movin' (a nigga popping lately)
Nigga fuck the club, these hoes can wait, if you don't relate
Then you should probably keep an eye out on shit that you doin' (a nigga popping lately)
And who said it can't be me, I been up grindin' for eighty weeks nigga
I got no time for ADD niggas, I'm tryna put on for eight-eighteen nigga
I'm tryna put on for eight-eighteen nigga
I'm bout to put on for eight-eighteen like

[Hook]
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (I got 'em talkin' lately)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (A nigga popping lately)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (I see you watchin' baby)
Bitch I'm 'bout the business (A nigga popping ain't he)

[Outro/Ad-Lib]
Damn
