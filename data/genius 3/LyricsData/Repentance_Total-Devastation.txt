Dark moment in the dawning day
Before the rays of light break the sky
Confessions of crimes yet undone

Cry now for the relief
Run to the chalice of damnation
Break of dawn reveals your lies

Last one to suffer in the sins of time
Felt them burn unerased - torn

Victim they made you - carrier of others' crimes
Though you are one of them
Without remorse, hand in hand with the master of
Without remorse, hand in hand with the master of lies

Cry now for the relief
Run to the chalice of damnation
Break of dawn reveals your lies

Everlasting pain that seeds your life

Guilt eats you inside
As you hide in the shadows of betrayal
Your cries are heard for the last time

Dark moment in the dawning day
Before the rays of light break the sky
Evil one giving helping hand
You take it hopeless - torn

Victim they made you - carrier of others' crimes
Though you are one of them
Without remorse, hand in hand with the master of
Without remorse, hand in hand with the master of lies
