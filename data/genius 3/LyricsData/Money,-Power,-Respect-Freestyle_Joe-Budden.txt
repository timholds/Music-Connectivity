[Fabolous]
They call me F-A-Beezy, sometimes Stizzo
The wrist on freezy, neck on glizzo
The coupe move easy at two-double-izzo
Truck look cheezy [?]
And it's jacked up like it sit on stilettos
Can't you see the glit on the pebble that sit on the bezel
None of you little scraps couldn't get on my level
Take more than a hot song to try to sit on the devil
Got respect when I killed Money Power the first time
When they tried to knock down the towers the first time
And the only reason I'm talking bout it
Is so you know the real talk of New York's about it
I'm with a bitch, with a tight ass that shakes
Her suck game will one gulp White Castle shakes
Got home right past the lake
When I come, they stop us this time, might blast the jake
I'm the nigga on the couches in clubs
And I stand out from the rest of the slouches and scrubs
Bottles and bottles with a train of pretty hoes
That look like they could be amazing videos
We in the caps with the Yankee logos
Blowing on the stanky dro dro
The pinky snow-globe, and you know the links be so "oh"
Niggas look fast but they blinks be slow-mo
I could spot a kinky ho though
All hood, but she just tryna make you think she SoHo
Plus I know the game like the back of my hand
When I'm lazy, you can catch me in the back of sedans
When I'm gone, you can bet I'm coming back with a tan
With the Mickey D signs on the back of my pants
And I act like the man, cause this my time
Plus the hood say they miss my dimes
It's young money

[Ransom]
All you see me with is Coogi, dogs and long chains
Fucking with some bougie broads with long brain
Plus now I'm usually calm, the storm came
But still keep a toolie on like John Wayne
Catch me in the kitchen, dope bricks on the fire
Them niggas that be spittin, those pricks is some liars
Never been pitchin, sold clips to them buyers
Me? I hang on the block like broke kicks on the wire
The kid is so nasty with it
Copped a new Benz and only paid half to get it
I'm a gorilla that had to get classy with it
Your dumb bird gave me head because Fab was with us
Could care less who your bitch be feeling
I'm in a loft with nice floors and crispy ceiling
As long as I get it off and get these millions
I retire to smoke weed like Ricky Williams

[Hitchcock]
Now your cake is gone, niggas wanna hate the Storm
Cause they know my team reign surpreme, and I'm Jason Bourne
Catch a case Im gone, just another face to mourn
Stay down 'fore the tre-pound leave your face deformed
Listen pal, you ain't really pitching vials
Just wanna rap back and forth like 'Kiss and Styles
Every other day, you could say I be switching dials
Fourty-grand, fifty-thou, and I got the fifty-cal
It's Hitchcock, Hannibal of rap
You ain't gotta see a show to see an animal attack
Im an animal a warrior in fact
With tre snubs, repping A-dub in the corner with gats
And Im in a fast car, with a crash bar
Built in the dash part sorta like Nascar
Outlast yall because I treat the track like a cell phone
I burn it down to the last bar

[Stack Bundles]
You're welcome
You ain't gotta thank me for what i did to the mixtapes
Make sure the labels get my shit straight
You ain't gotta pat me on the back (back!)
Just pack me in that 'Bach ('Bach!)
With a dime, fine wine and some blinds in the back
Curtains is too extra
Though the silk shirt's fucking with my chest hairs
I'm in love with the texture
The gorgeous one has spoken, clear stones in his hair
Pink in his eyes like Jesus has awoken
It's all in the belt buckle, a mansion in that
And if you call shorty, buckle, just imagine the neck
And the trousers Mugler, the shoes is Maury
These rap niggas startin to bore me
Most MCs square, so the button-up's MC squared
I'm insulted when they offer me ears
The babes want me in [?]
And you know the boys want me in states
I'm retiring pyrex - call me Seymour Cake!

[Joe Budden]
Now niggas say they in the hood like Mr. Softee
They in the hood getting treated like Mr. Softie
“I clap the four-fifth”, if you believe that
Then you believe Rick James died of natural causes
I'm twisting up trees-chronic to switching up ebonics
Started in the fifth grade, switching up etonics
Know a few dudes that'll spit at your dome
So go see 'em if you really want invisible stones
Tryna get at me to hit him
Just type 40 acres and a mule in your navi system
My hood -- they kidnapping your kids
Trying to Tom Cruise and Jamie what Collateral is
Wack dudes in the game is a problem
But they like Maurice Malone jeans, their name will stay on the bottom
Murdering that? Nah
Heard him, he's sub-par
Coyote Ugly rappers, keep working at your bars

[Paul Cain]
Cain got the heart of a soldier, mind of a general
Strategy is important, timing is critical
Clear tracks out, lyrically I'm a beast
I'm Brooklyn's backbone, epitome of the streets
Only the strong survive if you're physically weak
You get gunbut, stabbed and shot, and critically beat
Cause listen, ain't no shook hands in Brooklyn
Presidential with the matching bullet bracelet, it's a good look man
Call me whatever I hustle and I rap a little
See the color stones chain look like a pack of Skittles
I give em anthrax, every bar is that official
I know I'm a gangsta I ain't got to pack a pistol
I don't rap in riddles, I give it to a nigga
Straight, no chaser, I'm like Hen' on the rocks
If it ain't the fifth, it's probably the Glock
I'm the nigga Clue and Duro call when they need the bodies to drop
If it ain't the chain, it's probably the watch
When I ride
If it ain't the truck or sedan, it's probably the drop
Play the block, I don't party a lot
I'm the one who sent the goon with the snub
To get the jewels from the club
I could never blow all my dough
When I get at least ten people robbed at all my shows
And all I know: money, clothes, birds, and cars
Running from Po's, champagne, furs, and Rs
Quite sure you must've heard of the god
If not I'm Cain, Triangle Offense, I'm a third of the squad
I'm the first line of the defense, the star point guard
Is back starting, yall be used to riding the bench
Ayo, fuck that "no women, no kids" shit
When the shotty blows, everybody goes, business is business
But dig this, fuck a guilty conscience
I'll put a slug in you, really give you something to live with
Fuck street fighting - I pull a hammer in a split second
The kid breathe fire, and speak lightning
These niggas ain't writing
All they did was analyze my flow, and use my style so their liking, nigga

Now the year's new, I laid my game flat
I want my spot back, take two, motherfucker
