La ba bo di da bo di da bo da
La ba bo di da bo di da bo da
La ba bo di da bo di da bo da
La ba bo di da bo di da bo da

[Verse 1]
Sold his soul to crusade on a screen
A Worthless individual that knows everything
Don't hold back he's not pleasant or sweet
It's ignorance and jealousy that make's his heart beat

Oh, You don't know
You can't hurt him back

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause he's a fly on the wall
Yes an insect that crawls
If pesticide won't do it we've got nothing at all

[Chorus]
Bye bye
And I won't hurt like that
Bye bye
And I won't hurt like that (Hurt like that)

[Verse 2]
Sold his soul for a scrolling crusade
Hiding insecurity through this masquerade
Fi gets fi now thereâ€™s blood on the screen
It drips upon the floorboards but his conscience is clean

Oh, You don't know
You can't hurt him back

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause he's a fly that won't stall
Yes an insect that crawls
He validates existence through the post on your walls

[Chorus]
Bye bye
And I won't hurt like that
Bye bye
And I won't hurt like that (Hurt like that)
Bye bye
And I won't hurt like that
Bye bye
I won't hurt like that (Hurt like that)
Bye bye
Bye bye
