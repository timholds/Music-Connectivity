[Verse 1: Dels]
As the moon burns slow and the dust all settles
I pull words from the air and I fill them with mettle, see
You said, If you're thirsty lick the tears off my cheeks
Before they dry out - that's what you whispered to me, breathe
Puff, Puff, Pass, blow clouds in the sky
Skeleton Bones and flames in your eyes, see
Blah, Blah, Blah will I see you again?
I had a right laugh, there's no need to pretend
That you live in my head
That you live in my head

[Verse 2: Dels]
As the sun melts your face and drips on my palms
I spew my thoughts, you're eating my past
You said don't get too close because I am a killer
Aim for your heart, so you won't get up
Projections, dreams, crystalised scenes
We brush it off because it ain't what it seems
Blah, Blah, Blah will I see you again?
I had a right laugh, theres no need to pretend
That you live in my head
That you live in my head
That you live in my head
(You live in my head, you’ll never leave)

[Bridge]
I see you, you...
Because you live in my head
I hear you, you, you
Because you live in my head
Can’t feel you, you, you
Because you live in my head
I see you, you, you
Because you live in my head
I hear you...
(You live in my head)
