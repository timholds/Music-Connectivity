[Verse 1]
I used to ramble all over town
I'd be the last one out, I'd, close 'em down
Stay out all night
Baby, I was wrong

[Verse 2]
I didn't know that I could, feel this way
Thanks to you, girl, now I, have it made
So satisfied
Since you came along

[Chorus]
This old heart, ain't what it used to be
Girl, your love, sure is good to me
This old heart, ain't what it used to be
Girl, your love, sure is good to me

[Verse 3]
You were the first to ever, get inside
You took the lonely off of, my good heart
Turned things around
Oh, and now it's gone

[Chorus]
This old heart, ain't what it used to be
Girl, your love, sure is good to me
This old heart, ain't what it used to be
Girl, your love, sure is good to me

[Bridge]
Yeah, this old heart was barely beating, barely hangin' on
'Til you came around and made it strong
This old heart, ain't what it used to be
Girl, your love, sure is good to me

[Chorus]
This old heart, ain't what it used to be
Girl, your love, sure is good to me
This old heart, ain't what it used to be
Oh, girl, your love, sure is good to me

[Outro]
Sure is good to me
Sure is good to me
