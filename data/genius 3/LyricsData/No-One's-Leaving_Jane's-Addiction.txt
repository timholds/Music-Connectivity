I'm a white dread-I'm a white dread, so?
I'm a got a ring and I hang it from my nose
Got a little game and I take it to the park
I don't care who plays as long as the game is on
My sister and her boyfriend slept in the park
She had to leave home 'cause he was dark
Now they parade around in New York with a baby boy...
He's gorgeous!
Ain't nobody leaving!
No one's leaving...
Blacks call each other 'brother and sis''
Count me in 'cause I been missed
I've seen color changed by a kiss
Ask my brother and my sister
My sister and her boyfriend slept in the park
She had to leave home 'cause he was dark
Now they parade around in New York with a baby boy...
He's gorgeous!
Ain't nobody leaving!
No one's leaving!
Yeah, that's right...
Yeah, that's so...
Wish I knew everyone's nickname
All their slang and all their sayings
Every way to show affection, how to dress to fit the occasion...
Wish we all waved...
All waved... All waved...
I wish we all!
Wish we all!
Wish we all waved...
