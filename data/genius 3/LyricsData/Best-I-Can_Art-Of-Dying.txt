Tonight I feel like the world won't miss me
So much to say but there's no one listening
If we're alone are we all together in that

I threw a penny in a well for wishing
And prayed for all the things I think I'm missing
A little time is all I really need

I am doing the best I can with everything I am
Don't you know nobody's perfect
Do you understand how hard I'm trying to do the best I can
The best I can

A second chance to give you something
It takes a lifetime to come from nothing
I refuse to believe in running away, no

I am doing the best I can with everything I am
Don't you know nobody's perfect
Do you understand how hard I'm trying for you
I am doing the best I can with everything I am
Don't you know I think you're worth it
Do you understand how hard I'm trying to do the best I can

The best I can

I got a picture of what matters and I keep it close to my heart
It's a little faded but so am I

Cause I am doing the best I can with everything I am
Don't you know nobody's perfect
Do you understand how hard I'm trying for you
I am doing the best I can with everything I am
Don't you know I think you're worth it
Do you understand how hard I'm trying to do the best I can
The best I can
The best I can
The best I can

And I'm doing, oh I'm doing the best I can
I am, I'm doing the best, oh the best I can
The best I can, oh the best I can
Oh I keep doing, keep trying
