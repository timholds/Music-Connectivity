[Intro]
I think I’m having a meltdown

[Verse 1]
I feel the tension
(I feel the tension)
Confessions told
(Tell me, tell me everything)
Insanity is taking over
The fantasies are driving me mad

[Pre-Hook]
Before
Never let go
Before I fold
Before
Never let go
Before I fold

[Hook]
You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Controlling me losing it all
You know that I am heading for a meltdown
Just take away the tears
I’m suffocating, don’t leave me here waiting

[Verse 2]
The cry within
(Cry within)
The flesh is bold
(Tell me, tell me everything)
Calamity is waiting silent
The razor is cutting the pain and letting it out

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Over and over in my head
I see your scars
Remember the day when we first met
Take me back

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Outro]
