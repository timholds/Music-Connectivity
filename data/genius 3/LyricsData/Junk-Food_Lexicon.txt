[Chorus:]
So perfect, it's poison
Your no good for me girl
Well I know, and I know
You gotta hurt me baby

So perfect, it's poison
Your no good for me girl
Well I know, and I know
Your lost without me baby

Your my junk food baby, (uh uh)
Junk food baby (whatever)
Junk food baby (uh uh)
I love you but your killing me

Your my junk food baby, (uh uh)
Junk food baby (whatever)
Junk food baby (uh huh)
I love you but your killing me

[Verse 1:]
Yeah she puts the calories on
Like an extra cheese calzone
Now I'm tired and fatigued
At night I can't sleep
And I'm wondering how come

Sh- sh- sh- sh- she's a nasty girl I know
Trust me dude I know
The flick of her ear spells confidence
Her attitude says "Your too slow."

Yeah man, she's got me hot
I'm on the run
I just can't tell if it's to or from
But I stepped in gum
Now I'm stuck in place
Duck to the taste
Up to your waste

Stuck to this blind and big potential
But it'll fade like it's written in pencil
I'm a, grown man
I gotta eat better
Gotta get the sweets out forever, come on!

[Chorus:]
So perfect, it's poison
Your no good for me girl
Well I know, and I know
You gotta hurt me baby

So perfect, it's poison
Your no good for me girl
Well I know, and I know
Your lost without me baby

Your my junk food baby, (uh uh)
Junk food baby (whatever)
Junk food baby (uh uh)
I love you but your killing me

Your my junk food baby, (uh uh)
Junk food baby (whatever)
Junk food baby (uh huh)
I love you but your killing me

[Verse 2:]
She's not someone you can trust
I could tell the first time we touched
Didn't give me a name
Wrote a D on her neck
Said it stood for Dangerous

But I was hungry so I took a bite
Tried to satisfy my appetite
Two scoops with the works dripping out the sides
I got heart disease and I...

Aww man, her plan is dark just like her tan
She acts like this cause she can
She's like a Killah! A pycho Killah!
Caskets say, I'm getting swept away
.
Your killing me, filling me
Up with fats and carbs and lards
She looks like she knows something I don't know
She's laughing at a joke and I'm too slow

[Chorus:]
So perfect, it's poison
Your no good for me girl
Well I know, and I know
You gotta hurt me baby

So perfect, it's poison
Your no good for me girl
Well I know, and I know
Your lost without me baby

Your my junk food baby, (uh uh)
Junk food baby (whatever)
Junk food baby (uh uh)
I love you but your killing me

Your my junk food baby, (uh uh)
Junk food baby (whatever)
Junk food baby (uh huh)
I love you but your killing me

[Bridge:]
There's a party in the girls, throw the keys around
There's a party in the girls, throw the keys around
There's a party in the girls, throw the keys around
And you ain't getting in unless your cool like them

There's a party in the girls, throw the keys around
There's a party in the girls, throw the keys around
There's a party in the girls, throw the keys around
And you ain't getting in unless your cool like them

[Chorus:]
So perfect, it's poison
Your no good for me girl
Well I know, and I know
You gotta hurt me baby

So perfect, it's poison
Your no good for me girl
Well I know, and I know
Your lost without me baby

Your my junk food baby, (uh uh)
Junk food baby (whatever)
Junk food baby (uh uh)
I love you but your killing me

Your my junk food baby, (uh uh)
Junk food baby (whatever)
Junk food baby (uh huh)
I love you but your killing me... (whatever)
