[Verse 1: Lyndsey Gunnulfsen]
Your doubts of me are constant reminders
Of why I should stop hoping
It's hard to dream with eyes stitched open
I can feel them pull me under
They can take my sights but they can't take me

[Chorus]
They pull me under every night
They're always waiting for me and I know it
And they sing together
Put your heart to your eyes and you'll find
Yeah, you'll find, what you're looking for

[Verse 2: Lyndsey Gunnulfsen]
I can feel them pull me under
Taking my sights but you can't take me

[Chorus]
They pull me under every night
They're always waiting for me and I know it
And they sing together
Put your heart to your eyes and you'll find
Yeah, you'll find, what you're looking for

[Verse 3: Lyndsey Gunnulfsen]
Keep your eyes off the door
And I won't let them pull you under
Keep your eyes off the door
And I won't let them pull you under

[Verse 4: Josh Herzer]
Keep your eyes on me
I won't let them pull you under
(Keep your eyes on me)

[Chorus]
They pull me under every night
They're always waiting for me and I know it
And they sing together
Put your heart to your eyes and you'll find
Yeah, you'll find, what you're looking for
