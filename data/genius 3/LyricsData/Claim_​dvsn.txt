[Verse 1]
And I know youâ€™re tired of waiting
I know a lot of girls hate you
Or they wanna replace you
'Cause of the way that I rate you
You've heard a lot, but it's all game
A couple dopeboys, ball players
Couple niggas straight out the fraud game
Same one, but they all changed
They hit a lick, hit a lick, hit a lick
Hit a lick, hit a lick with you, with you
Surprisin' themselves
When he got you he didn't even know what to do
With you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't even blame him
But I'm back around the way and
You know I've been waitin' for so long

[Chorus]
Surprised you're still talkin' to the same dude
Nobody's last-named you by now
I guess I can't blame you, ooh
But I'm just tryna change your mind now
Somebody should have claimed you
Somebody should have claimed you by now, oh
Hey, hey yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Wanna give your two weeks in
A release for the trip you've been plannin'
You stayed in for two weekends
Datin' them dudes you've been
Girl that's a good reason
To unload yourself, take control of self, yeah
Girl, I know you well, plus you know yourself, yeah yeah
You've been wastin' time
You know that I'm right, to be honest, I

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't even blame him
But I'm back around the way and
You know I've been waitin' for so long

[Chorus]
Surprised you're still talkin' to the same dude
Nobody's last-named you by now
I guess I can't blame you, ooh
But I'm just tryna change your mind now
Somebody should have claimed you (claimed you, baby)
Somebody should have claimed you by now, oh
Hey, hey yeah, yeah
