[Verse:]
Baby girl you're all
That I'm thinking of
You put this feelin inside of me
It says you are the one
Yeah, the only one
I couldn't help myself but put it in words
You are the sunshine in my life, girl
And you know, I'd say it over again
Nothin could ever tear us apart
Lemme tell you babe

[Chorus:]
All of my life I've been searchin for that one
And now that you've come to me I don't have to run
Chasin' all the girls while I'm hangin' with my crew
Now it's all about just me and my boo
Everyday 'n everynight it just goes on
That's how much love I have for you girl I'm so sprung
Baby this was meant to be, it's such a blessin'
Cuz we will be together, forever

[Verse 2:]
As I look above
Thankful for your love
Two thirty you will be callin' me
When I pick you up
We'll go to the park
Ain't nothin better than being with you girl
You are the sunshine in my life girl
And you know, I'd say it over again
Nothin could ever tear us apart
Let me tell you babe

[Chorus:]
All of my life I've been searchin for that one
And now that you've come to me I don't have to run
Chasin' all the girls while I'm hangin' with my crew
Now it's all about just me and my boo
Everyday 'n everynight it just goes on
That's how much love I have for you girl I'm so sprung
Baby this was meant to be, it's such a blessin'
Cuz we will be together, forever

[Bridge:]
Bein' inside of you is so heaven in my heart
The way you say my name I know you feel the same girl you are my one
And the only one
That's why you're my baby
And this is what I have to say...

[Rap gd]
Yo, listen
I love you down in every way
It doesn't matter baby everyday
From the bottom to the top have it'cho way
It's all about the way you feel baby
Wanna make it like extacy
To where you're sayin' my name softly
And we can take it down south baby
Any freakin' route as long as you and I can be as one, hey

[Rap T. O. P]
You know I do it all for you you're my boo that's true wanna let the world know you're my baby
Got a lotta love comin' from above and I thank him everyday, it's the T-O-P
I don't wanna be without your love
Through the push 'n shove you're all I ever wanna be thinkin' of

[Chorus:]
All of my life I've been searchin for that one
And now that you've come to me I don't have to run
Chasin' all the girls while I'm hangin' with my crew
Now it's all about just me and my boo
Everyday 'n everynight it just goes on
That's how much love I have for you girl I'm so sprung
Baby this was meant to be, it's such a blessin'
Cuz we will be together, forever
