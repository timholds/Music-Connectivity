Six A.M. you left me for the last time
On my doorstep blinking in the sunshine
Blamed and framed, I'm frozen in the picture
Hanging in the space you left inside me
Climbed upstairs into the final scene
Waiting for the credits to appear
For all the years that I've been starring
Starring in a film with you and leading
Leading with a star I knew but I'm waking up
In a lone beam of light where the dust is dancing as the music fades
On my way out for the very last time
Off my doorstep straight into the sunshine
Walking west and following the coastline
Looking for a sea change
You led me here when the world began
And the breakers shook the moonlit sand
Saw your pale face shining through the spray
And I was blown away
With the feeling I was starring
Starring in a film with you and leading
Leading with a star I knew but I'm waking up
In a lone beam of light where the dust is dancing as the music fades
