Look here bitch I'm better than you
You couldn't even talk 1 and 1 is two
Say What?, yeah you heard me say
You colored out the lines, barbie won't play

Screw you, oops did I cuss?
Look I got a bigger busssst
Could I borrow that book shelf
Think Granny needs a little elf

Why? Be yon say, what'd I do
Walked on water floating with
Damn bitch collaborated
Scott Irish french stew

Didn't do much but feed a child
Black to the mix to the silly wild
All but a page in a book or a file
Pasteurized pie, a virtual cornucopia of smile
