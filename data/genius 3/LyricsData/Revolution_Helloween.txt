Only a few steps ahead
You'll see chances You can't ignore
Only a few days ago
Life seemed useless and sad
Now You can see what it's like
When You know what You're fighting for
Now You can see what it's worth
To believe in your faith

Revolution, revolution
Tear it once apart
For a brand new start
Revolution, revolution
Let me guess what's in your mind
And lies in your heart

Now You can see things much clearer
As long as You understand
How You can use your conviction
And build something new
Follow your visions
Keep being suspicious and curious
Never accept an excuse
And learn how to say no

Revolution, revolution
Tear it once apart
For a brand new start
Revolution, revolution
Let me guess what's in your mind
And lies in your heart

Solo:

In the midnight hour
Making future plans
Selfless with the tragedy in your eyes
Feel the mighty hunger
Deep inside your soul
Keeps You fighting for justice
And for the truth

Revolution, revolution
Tear it once apart
For a brand new start
Revolution, revolution
Let me guess what's in your mind
And lies in your heart
