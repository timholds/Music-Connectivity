[Verse 1: Jason Chu]
Tired of feelin' weak, too tired to not repeat
Starin' at the mirror, I fear what I see
Haunted by all my dreams, razor sing me to sleep
Either that or anything to maybe get through to me
Cheated on, cheated on her, tryna cope
Pills and porn fill my home
I feel far gone, where is God?
I thank God Pop don’t got no hand guns in the house
If he did I might not make it past fall
And if Prozac and prayers don’t work
I pretend that the heartbeat in me don't hurt
I hear the lil' grudges, bad habits
Lil' packets, packs of matches
Lil' cuts from lil' scissors hidden in the highest cab'nets
They whisper lies, so many lies, sweet little lies
Tellin' me my family is better off if I die
I been choked by the fight, but I know I can write
And if my words breathe for me maybe I’ll be alive

[Interlude: Matt Almodiel, Emily Chen  & Jason Chu]
I, ooh, I live if I breathe
(I live if I breathe, live if I breathe)
Live if I, ooh I live if I breathe
(I live if I breathe)

[Verse 2: Jason Chu]
If silence is a curse, words can be prayers
If my heart is a hearse, these verses are rebirth
Hear me out, full of doubt, fear of crowds
Full of fears I can’t share with my mom
But I can write for my peers
These are psalms, these are hymns
As I bare myself, new peace draws near
The hopes of a future, I don’t see it but I dream it
Despite my darkest secrets, I lit a light and found my freedom
Needy and out of control, but I found a way to adjust
I had enough of the guilt, I had to give it all up
Afraid of lettin' it go, that fear was rippin' me up
Had to stop relivin' the past so the present don’t pass me up

I learn to listen, and I learn to speak
I learn to love by learnin' to receive (yea)
I learn to listen, and learn to speak
I learn to love by learnin' to receive

[Matt Almodiel]
I'mma take it down, I'mma start from scratch
I know one day there ain't time for me to come back
You see we come from hurt, with hurt there's pain
There ain't nothin' on my sleeve that I'm ashamed of

[Verse 3: Jason Chu]
And now my story recorded
Shows the hope and the courage
That I always had inside of me even though I ignored it
Tearin' up at my Mac, as I look back on my voyage
From the teenage depression, adolescent sensitive horrors
In the dark for so long, I forgot to look for the light
I felt abandoned and left, I didn’t know what was right
Now I write what I write for your healing, for your sight
For your hope, for your home
For your future so you can fight
And I know you think you’re the only one
To feel like the only one
Who’s had to walk this journey alone
But I wrote you this poem and I fit these words to a song
To let you know struggle’s just a part of the growth
And I got through the cutting, and I’m facing my problems
And I still got some issues but I’ve started unsubscribing
I’m just a broken kid with dreams and a story to tell
And I know you got your story as well
Now inhale, let it breathe

[Outro: Matt Almodiel]
I know, I know that I can try
I know that everything's alright
One day, I know that things will change
You'll see, this won't get the best of me today
I'll breathe my way
I'll grow each day for me
I'm better once I live if I breathe
Live if I breathe
Live if I breathe
Live if I breathe
Live if I breathe
Live if I breathe
Live if I breathe
