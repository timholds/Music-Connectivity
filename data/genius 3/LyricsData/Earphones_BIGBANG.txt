One man can make a lot of waves
Another man will get a lot of surf
On the other side of the planet
A little boy with earphones on
And a big smile on his face
On the wrong side of the planet
Starts shaking with the music
But can he really dig it
Will little stompin' feet ever regret it
I don't know
Sometimes you win
Sometimes you lose
And if you pick what others choose
You're gonna sing the blues

But you're gonna find
A better place and a meaning
Some other time
I'm sure you'll find the feeling
Let go of your mind
Sometimes you need to lose control
You gotta go down and
Take a fall

Now there's a man who's blind as a bat
He doesn't care, he knows where it's at
On the other side of the planet
He's singing with sunglasses on
And a big smile on his face
Not on the wrong side of the planet

He starts shaking with the music
And you can really dig it
Nobody's going to regret it
Oh i know
Sometimes you win
Somtimes you lose
And if you pick what
Others choose
You'll sing the blues

But you're gonna find
A better place and a meaning
Some other time
I'm sure you'll find the feeling
Let go of your mind
Sometimes you need to lose control
You gotta go down
And take a fall
