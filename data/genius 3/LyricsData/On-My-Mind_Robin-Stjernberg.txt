I can't believe you, stick around, I put you
Trough everything that's been and all I've done
I'll say this to you, you're the rock I turn to
Cause I can't seem to find my way alone
And if I die tonight, you'll still be out on my mind
When everything you love, just fades away
And see the flashes of, the choice you made
I've been in seas of fire and if I die tonight
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind... oh, yeah
You'll still be on my mind
Was gonna tell you, what you meanin' to me
But I can't find a word strong enough
My heart is beating, it will keep on beating
Cause baby all I do is all for ya!
And if I die tonight, you'll still be out on my mind
When everything you love, just fades away
And see the flashes of, the choice you made
I've been in seas of fire and if I die tonight
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind...
When everything you love, just fades away
And see the flashes of, the choice you made
I've been in seas of fire and if I die tonight
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind... mm no no
You'll still be on my mind...
When everything you love, just fades away
And see the flashes of, the choice you made
I've been in seas of fire and if I die tonight
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind
Oh, you'll still be on my mind...
When everything you love, just fades away
And see the flashes of, the choice you made
I've been in seas of fire and if I die tonight
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind
You'll still be on my mind...
