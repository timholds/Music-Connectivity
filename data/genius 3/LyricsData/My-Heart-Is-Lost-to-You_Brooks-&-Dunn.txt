[Verse 1]
Maybe it was the moonlight
The scent of you on the breeze
Maybe it was your shadow that fell over me
Such a beautiful stranger
Eyes darker than coal
Your first look crossed the desert
Into my soul

[Chorus]
Mi Corzon perdido en ti
My heart is lost to you
You have captured my love completely
My heart is lost to you
Oh my heart is lost to you

[Verse 2]
Maybe it was the music
The way it moved with your hair
Or the heat of the moment
That hung in the air
But when I saw you there dancing
Mesmerized by the gaze
There was some kind of magic
That led me away

[Chorus]
