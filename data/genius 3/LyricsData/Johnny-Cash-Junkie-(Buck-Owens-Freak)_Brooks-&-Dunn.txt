[Verse 1]
I grew up on Waylon, Willie and the Stones
Soundtrack to my life is a hillbilly song
Old boys like Merle, that man in black
Said what they wanted, never looked back
I tear up to "Crying In Time"
Me and Johnny fight to walk the line

[Chorus]
I still drive a pick-up, I still wear boots
I grew up country, I'm proud of my roots
Red, white and blue are the colours I bleed
I'm a Johnny Cash junkie and a Buck Owens freak

[Verse 2]
We got redneck women driving ATV's
Wearing camo bikinis on CMT
I throw back a beer, I pledge allegiance to Hank
I'll take a little less pop, a lot more twang
Three cords and some down-home soul
Some things never grow old

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Three cords and some down-home soul
Some things never grow old

[Chorus]
