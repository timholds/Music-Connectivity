[Intro]
Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be a player
Don't wanna be..

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
I'm yours, you're mine, for sure

[Verse 1]
I had enough of running wild
I'm switching up my whole lifestyle
I don't wanna live the way I used to
I'm giving up the booty calls
Spending C's at the ta-ta bars
No leaving with two or three girls to get me off

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need is one who's really down
Someone to turn this player's life around
Girl, I feel like you could be the one
To make a difference in my life
'Cause I'm tired of living trife

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
I'm yours, you're mine, for sure

[Verse 2]
No rolling with an entourage
Celeb style like a movie star
Sippin' Dom with the ladies all around me
Dropping girls off at the wee hours of the morning
Gettin' beeps from a la di da di
A true player never gets a chance to sleep, no

[Pre-Chorus]
All I need is one who's really down
Someone to turn this player's life around
Girl I feel like you could be the one
To make a difference in my life
Cause I'm tired of living trife

[Chorus]
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
I'm yours, you're mine, for sure

[Bridge]
Baby girl, I'm bugging over you
You got me giving up the things I used to do
You got so much in life to gain
And to prove to you I'm getting out the game
No more player style

[Chorus (Repeat until end)]
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
Don't wanna be a player no more
I think I found someone I could live my life for
I'm yours, you're mine, for sure
