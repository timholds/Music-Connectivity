Three days was the morning
My focus three days old
My head, it landed to the sounds of cricket bows...
I am proud man anyway...
Covered now by three days...
Three ways was the morning
Three lovers, in three ways
We knew when she landed, three days she'd stay
I am a proud man anyway...
Covered now by three days...
We saw shadows of the morning light
The shadows of the evening sun
Till the shadows and the light were one
Shadows of the morning light
The shadows of the evening sun
Till the shadows and the light were one...
True hunting is over
No herds to follow
Without game, men prey on each other
The family weakens by the bite we swallow...
True leaders gone, of land and people
We choose no kin but adopted strangers
The family weakens by the length we travel...
All of us with wings...
All of us with wings...
All of us with wings!
All of us with wings!
All of us with wings!
All of us with wings!
Erotic Jesus lays with his Marys
Loves his Marys
Bits of puzzle, hitting each other
All now with wings!
'Oh my Marys! Never wonder... Night is shelter for nudity's shiver...'
All now with wings...
