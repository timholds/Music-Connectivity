[Intro: Mariah]
Uh, whoa, whoa
ReRe's got a new boyfriend (yeah, uh-uh)
ReRe and Kenny sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh, baby
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh, baby (oh)
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh, baby
Whoo!

[Hook]
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I need a, I need a, I need a, I need a
I love a, love a, I love a, love a
A lover, a lover, a lover, a loverboy

[Verse 1: Mariah]
I got myself a lover who knows what I like
When he invites me over I come every time
And when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go, it's delivered on time

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah]
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
He's all mine
I need a, I need a, I need a, I need a
And his loving makes me high
I love a, love a, I love a, love a
Like a taste of ecstasy
A lover, a lover, a lover, a loverboy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

[Chorus: Mariah]
Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
Loverboy, come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
(You can make me)
Shudder with anticipation all night long

[Verse 2: Mariah]
I got myself a lover and he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven to feel him inside
'Cause when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go, it's delivered on time

[Pre-Chorus: Mariah]
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I get weak
I need a, I need a, I need a, I need a
When he's gettin' extra sweet
I love a, love a, I love a, love a
When he caressed my whole body
A lover, a lover, a lover, a loverboy
All I need is him to be my loverboy

[Chorus: Mariah]
Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
(I enjoy the way you rock me)
Loverboy, come on and take me
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation all night long

[Verse 3: Cameo]
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you (yes, I do)
'Cause you affect me, you fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do, oh
This stuff is starting now, oh
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now, ooh
My eyes roll in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you (Candy!)
Simply put, you're the reason why (you're the reason why)
Even though I'm real shy, it's like candy
I attempt to look my best for you, indeed I do, just for you

[Chorus: Mariah & Cameo]
Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more (give it to me), touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long (all night long)
(Strawberry) Loverboy, come on and take me
(Raspberry) Only you know how to make me
(All those good things)
(Diamonds and gumdrops)
Shudder with anticipation all night long
(That's what you seem to me)
Loverboy, come on and love me (oh)
Give me more, touch me and touch me
(This stuff is starting, staring now)
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
(Strawberry) Loverboy, come on and take me
(Raspberry) Only you know how to make me
(All those good things)
(Diamonds and gumdrops)
Shudder with anticipation all night long
(That's what you seem to me)
Loverboy, come on and love me (oh)
Give me more, touch me and touch me (baby)
I enjoy the way you rock me...
