[Hook: Evanescence Sample]

How can you see into my eyes Like open doors

[Verse 1: Youngin]

Listen closely as I bare my motherfucking soul on this shit
'cause this will never come again
I forgot don't nobody give a fuck about the music that I make
I'm the only nigga that'll hear
I'm alone on this motherfucking planet Earth
Shit I wonder why I'm here in the first place
Is it for Amariana's sake, to help guide her in the right way
And try to keep her safe
But I'm failing at that too the truth is I don't even see her
She cries every time I go
And that image will forever be stuck in my head
For how long, dog I don't even know
And you don't even know the half of the shit I feel
So how the fuck you gonna try to give me advice
Why the fuck you think I'm quiet as shit, and I stay to myself
It's the only way I act nice
When I open my mouth a lot of evil comes out
And the demons inside start to show face
And they really show-off when I start to showcase
This flow over beats with a lot of bass
That I purposely place in the instrumental that I produce
To get your muhfuckin speaker knocking, keep your body rocking
But you'll never know it
'cause a rapper from another city is who you jocking
But fuck that, it's over with and done now and I'm one now
With the fact that I'll never make it
How the fuck I'm supposed to get love from the outside
When my own homeboys won't even play it, and that's real shit
That I deal with every motherfucking day
So I always try my best to stay the fuck away
I wake up in the morning and look into the mirror
At my own face and say

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Youngin]

This is something that I'm feeling from my fucking heart
Can't you hear the fucking passion in my voice
This the last song that you'll ever hear from me
Until somebody decides to fuck with the boy
All the Michael Jordans of the hood tend to always go unnoticed
'cause they ain't got a way out
People sitting around and waiting for them to make it
The same people don't wanna help out
I done already had a vision of my future
And you wouldn't believe the shit a nigga saw
Nobody was there, just me alone on the streets
And let me tell you what a nigga saw
Somehow BM knew where a nigga was
And brought Amariana pass there to see me
And I apologized because I failed her
Please baby don't grow up to be me
Illuminati want my mind, soul, and my body
Secret society trying to keep their eyes on me
Is it the eyes of above or below please tell me
But I guess I gotta wait and see
And I'm from D.C. not the DMV
I could give a motherfuck about your unity
Especially when I'm hated by my own people 'cause of my skin
Light skin, dark skin, please
We are all the same to the people that's running this shit
And y'all killing niggas over shoes
And the KKK probably sitting back chilling
All they gotta do is turn on the evening news, and enjoy the show
And if I die today let the record show
Nobody ever knew another one of me
This a suicide note from an emcee
Time to put this rap shit six feet under me and I'm wondering

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Youngin]

My heartbeats getting weaker, every time that I speak on a new beat
And my soul is escaping as i mix it all down
But soon I'll be at peace
I'm at war with my inner-self because he wants to be exposed
But the physical won't let him out
And the animosity inside is getting real
I'mma fuck around and end up in the crazy house
I got a bottle of pills and a blade right beside me
Trying to figure out how I wanna go
And I've been trying to escape through an exit
What's keeping me around I don't even know
But it's holding me back I wish it lets go
And let me move on with the life I wanna live
I'm convinced that Earth is hell and we've been sent here
To suffer through eternal punishment
As the world turns, we need to learn more about it
So we can be properly prepared for Armageddon
I see the reaper closing in and he getting closer and closer
And fuck it dog I'mma let him
Because I'm ready to go, I done had it up to hear
With this bullshit that I'm feeling in my heart
It's only one way to achieve complete freedom
And that's to go join B.I.G. and Pac
And like B.I.G. said "you're nobody 'til somebody kills you"
But what about killing yourself
I guess I gotta forever be unknown and unseen
Like a nigga album that got shelved
As I take a final look into the mirror, my life gets weirder
I don't believe who I see
Is it you Gary, he responds with a head nod
Then looks deeply into my eyes, as he asks me

[Hook]

[Outro: Youngin]

Now i lay me down to rest
I had some shit to get off my chest
I plan to die right where this song ends
I pray God let's me in but I don't give a f... (gunshot)
