[Verse 1]
Under rocks of memories
Underneath to desire
I found what I'm missing in your fire
Up above the skyline
High above the lights
You've become the echo of my life

[Chorus]
Woah oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you
Woah oh oh oh oh, I couldn't let you go if I tried to
You fly me so high, I look down below
The shadow of night hides the way that we glow
Woah oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you

[Build-up A]
Woah, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Woah, all these feelings, all these feelings
Woah, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Woah, all these feelings, all these feelings

[Build-up B]
You fly me so high, I look down below
The shadow of night hides the way that we glow
Oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you

[Drop]
I wanna lose myself inside you

[Build-up A]
Woah, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Woah, all these feelings, all these feelings
Woah, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Woah, all these feelings, all these feelings

[Verse 2]
Out of ashes rising
Out of breath with you
In the end I'm finding a perfect truth
And out of this sunrise
And out of this moon
I know you'll be coming with me soon

[Chorus]
Woah oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you
Woah oh oh oh oh, I couldn't let you go if I tried to
You fly me so high, I look down below
The shadow of night hides the way that we glow
Woah oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you

[Build-up A]
Woah, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Woah, all these feelings, all these feelings
Woah, just keep breathing, just keep breathing
Woah, all these feelings, all these feelings

[Build-up B]
You fly me so high, I look down below
The shadow of night hides the way that we glow
Oh oh oh oh, I wanna lose myself inside you
