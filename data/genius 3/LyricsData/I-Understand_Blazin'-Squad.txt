(Krazy)
I think about you every day
Every night, I know you see
I know you think I know you
Feel that i'm right, I wanna
Make things new, let the past
Flow through, I'd love to have
Fun like we used to do

(Rocky B)
I understand what you're
Goin' throgh, if I was in
Your shoes I'd feel like you
And have a clue, but you
Gotta let me into your
Problems, and we can
Innovate, communicate
And gradually solve them

(Flava and Krazy)

(Chorus)
Hey shortee, hear me

Goin' through, its ok baby

Make it through, the krazy
Dayz when we get emotinal
And wanna cry just believe
Me shortee, I got your back
And we will make it through

(Kenzie)
Come on now girl express
Your feelings to me, if you
Can't explain to me what the
Problem be, and I got your
Back you know that I really
Want you, shortee understand
Coz I know what you're

To the future and forget about
The past, open up your heart
Girl don't leave me in the dark

To know these things, come

(Flava)
Listen babe, we can go for
A bit, I can show you a life
Never missed, with my hand
On your hip and my lips on
Your lips, we can call it a kiss
We can hold each other
We can make a wish

(Strider)
I can't take it no more, coz
Its hurting me so much that
I can't breathe, coz this pain
Is just far too great for me
And if you trust in my life
I'm sure that you will find
That my love that I give will
Never be declined

(Repeat Chorus to fade)
