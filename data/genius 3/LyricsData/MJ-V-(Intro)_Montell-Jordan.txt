(Talking)
Man, who would've thought I would've made it this far?
It's number five
Five albums
I recognize that it's because of you (c'mon)
It's only by your grace that I'm even here
So, how can I keep it hot?

*beat comes in* Like this...

(Singing)
M - my masterpiece, monumental
O - outstanding on instrumentals
N - to the ladies for the nights that you're naughty
T - to the thugs and the niggas in the party (set it off)
E - fifth record, everybody put ya hands up
L - in your Lex or your Lands, turn the jams up
L - not stutterin' the name, who's the man, what? (Montell)
Uh-huh, uh-huh, yeah, c'mon

M - my masterpiece, monumental
O - outstanding on instrumentals (enterprise)
N - to the ladies for the nights that you're naughty (that's right)

Family and friends, are you with me?
Here ya go again, are you with me?
To my ladies, are you with me?
Lookin' so tasty, are you with me?

To them thugs, are you with me?
Sittin' on them dubs, are you with me?
'Specially for the fans, are you with me?
Time to raise your hands, are you with me?
C'mon
