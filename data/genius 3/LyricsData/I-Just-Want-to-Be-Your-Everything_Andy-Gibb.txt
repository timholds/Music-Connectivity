[Verse 1:]
For so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you
Is more than strong, girl

Take it from me
If you give a little more
Than you're asking for
Your love will turn the key

Darling, mine
I would wait forever for those lips of wine
Build my world around you, darling
This love will shine, girl
Watch it and see

If you give a little more
Than you're asking for
Your love will turn the key

[Chorus:]
I, I just want to be your everything
Open up the Heaven in your heart
And let me be
The things you are to me
And not some puppet on a string

Oh, if I
If I stay here without you, darling
I will die
I want you laying in the love I have to bring
I'd do anything
To be your everything

[Verse 2:]
Darling, for so long
You and me been finding each other for so long
And the feeling that I feel for you
Is more then strong, girl

Take it from me
If you give a little more T
Han you're asking for
Your love will turn the key

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
