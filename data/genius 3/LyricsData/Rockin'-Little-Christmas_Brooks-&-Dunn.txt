I wrote a letter to Santa last night
Told him what I want to make my Christmas right
If I don't get it, I'm gonna be blue
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you

I don't want no tinker toys
Don't wanna waste my time drinkin' with the boys
There's only one thing that I wanna do
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you

I want a rockin' little Christmas
Rockin' little Christmas
If I get my wishes
It's gonna be delicious
A stockin' full of love for two

Well, I've been a good boy all year
I deserve a little Christmas cheer
I want your arms around me the whole night through
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you

Tell me baby what's it gonna be
Where you gonna spend your Christmas Eve
Will I be merry or will I be blue
I wanna rockin' little Christmas with you
