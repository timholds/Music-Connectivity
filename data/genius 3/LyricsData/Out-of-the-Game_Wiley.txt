Kicked out the game's what you get
Me? I walk out the game, then I walk back in it
Kicked out the game's what you get
Me? I walk out the game, then I walk back in it
Kicked out the game's what you get
Me? I walk out the game, then I walk back in it
Kicked out the game's what you get
Me? I walk out the game, then I walk back in it

[Verse 1]
Certain pricks try and call my name like dem man are ready for the king
No way, I live in the city of sin
Where you will trip up but you gotta get up
Girls try to set up but that's not a ting
I've got haters, raters plus alligators
Plus newcomers that are gonna try a ting
So I prepare myself, got [?] my health
Pen to paper, then I start writing about
Everyday life on a everyday hype like
Every day's mines and no day's yours
Watch the crowd sing along, 08' touring
I had the girls, yeah, Nolay's raw
But I want five mics, you get under four
And I ain't say a lot, but the kids say more
The work rate's high but your one's poor
Who am I? I'm real, add nine to a score
Add nine to a score, I'm in my late twenties
Before I reach three-o, I'm gonna be rich
So don't joke about my age if you're near twenty-four
Cause four years go quite quick
The flow's quite sick, I gave 'em a bit
But that weren't enough so I gave 'em more
The 21st century holds me responsible
For grime kids that are going on raw

Kicked out the game's what you get

Kicked out the game's what you get

Kicked out the game's what you get
Me? I walk out the game, then I walk back in it
Kicked out the game's what you get
Me? I walk out the game, then I walk back in it

[Verse 2]
I'm colder alie, that's right, Wiley's older alie
There's a few badman that I know on the road
They know me why I'm a soldier alie
I'm colder alie, too cold for them
Alie, them man ain't cold, they are spengs
Saw me on the ends but they never said a word
But they wanna try a ting with twenty-two friends
Ain't twenty-two but I've had many, two lengs left
Still feel strong, ain't got no strength left
Forget benchpress
I'm old-school like a Webley Tempest, had one way back
Skeamz, just give me a beat and I'll spray that
When I spray bars I'm colder alie
The return of the North West stroller alie
Alie, I've got fam in North West
Some spitters wanna talk till they got no talk left
None of them boys ain't colder alie
See me, KB and Riko and Gareth
Stopped at the shops, black [?] alie
I'm the black cloud that's over your life
I ain't gonna move, don't try and remove me
There's no way you are going to [?] me
I'm too unruly, I'm colder alie

Kicked out the game's what you get

[Verse 3]
I've got your girl in a dance with my tunes playing, grime tunes playing
You was sway before but now you're swaying
There's a few spitters that I rate in the scene
But you're not one of, that's what I'm saying
And there's a ton of youts that ain't playing
You can't test none of them, speak in poetry
Ain't gonna save him, it ain't gonna pay him
While I'm on the grind like pay out, day in
Wiley's in power, Ghetts is in charge?
He wouldn't last an hour with Devlin, Scorcher
Skepta, Jme, Frisco or Marc
Plus the kids now have got heart, the scene's too dark
Couldn't outsmart the new grime wave
They're on point? They don't know the half
Yeah I'm on point, I've got three different paths
And a fourth one, five years' time where we kipped upstairs
Sleep, I don't care if you wake up
Waste your time, I make money and laugh
It's my path, I choose my direction
I do the deals and I take my half
Don't wanna do it but I gotta be a businessman
Them times, start going on harsh
I told everybody that I'm gonna make sure
I save all my best till last

Kicked out the game's what you get

Kicked out the game's what you get
Me? I walk out the game, then I walk back in it
Kicked out the game's what you get
Me? I walk out the game, then I walk back in it
