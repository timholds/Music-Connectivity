[B.G.]
Uhh yeah nigga yeah-shit real round here
Uhh yeah nigga yeah-shit real round here
If you want it, you can get it my nigga-cause shit real round here
If you want it, you can get it my nigga-shit

[Verse 1 - B.G.]
Look if you ain't know ask somebody they'll tell you bout me
Nothin fake, nothin fraud, nothin bitch about me
I'm a G I been runnin these streets since a youngin
Since fourteen I been buckin, slangin heat ain't nothin
You want beef say somethin you can get it I ain't trippin
Once it's on just know you better not let me catch you slippin
Cause wherever we meet I'm a smash ya
Broad day light or around the club I'm a get at ya
If you let me tip down on you nigga you chaptered
I guarantee ya that it's gon'be a closed casket
I'm bout this what's understood don't need to be explained
Before the money and the fame I was a gangsta in the game
I ain't lyin when I tell you about me and my background
About me or my life style I ain't never backed down
I ain't never froze up, I ain't never turned state
I ain't never missed when I empty the clip out the K, nigga

[Hook - B.G.Repeat 4X]
However you want it nigga - you could get it cause shit real
It's get it how you live - you could kill or be killed

[Verse 2 - B.G.]
It's never die, do or get did nothin less fuck with the kidd
Get tooled to the head, tooled to the chest
Nigga I'm the best when it come to this street shit
You got ya hands full fuckin with me with this beef shit
I be on some all night flight, no sleep shit
Me, my dogg and two K's fuck that four deep shit
We comin with it - hundred round drummin with it
You runnin from it - we runnin with it, you bitch ass niggas ain't fuckin with it
I'm out c'here head first ready to go head up
Walkin with ya head down, bound to get ya head bust
Oh here the feds come I'm off the scene, off the block
I know to bust and move when it get hot
Shut down the shop open up another on the other side of town
Got yay and I got browns, Gizzle was a hustler and a headbuster all in one
Don't get it twisted I do this rap shit for fun, ya heard

[Hook - B.G.Repeat Till End]
However you want it nigga - you could get it cause shit real
It's get it how you live - you could kill or be killed
