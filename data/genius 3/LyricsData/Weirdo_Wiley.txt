[Verse 1]
Looking for the sky while I'm chilling on the sofa
I'm a weirdo, why you calling me a joker?
I make boiled eggs when I go into the kitchen
Even left my rucksack in the cab now it's missing
And my day's getting worse, my veins my burst
Dessert and dinner but I had dessert first
And I got the pang I will never buy merch
Here I go again getting busy on the verse

[Hook]
I'm a weirdo
But I'm not a bipolar
I'm a weirdo
But I'm not a bipolar
I'm a weirdo but I'm not a bipolar
Turn up at the show I ain't even on the poster
I'm a weirdo but I'm not a bipolar
Turn up at the show I ain't even on the poster
You ain't on the same planet as me
You ain't on the same planet as me
They ain't on the same planet as me
They ain't on the same planet as me
I'm a weirdo but I'm not a bipolar
Turn up at the show I ain't even on the poster
I'm a weirdo but I'm not a bipolar
Turn up at the show I ain't even on the poster

[Verse 2]
I'm a weirdo but I'm not a bipolar
Turn up at the show I ain't even on the poster
I walk around the place I ain't even got a chauffeur
I was like Kai, wow, no one ever knows you
I was like Kai you was the number one coaster
Used to be on Twitter you just chatting 'bout toasters
Now you're living in a space world full of focus
Shout out to the weirdos and the bipolars

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
When I land I've got a flow for you
When I land I've got a flow for you
When I land I've got a flow for you
When I land I've got a flow for you
Why? Cus I'm a weirdo, I'm not a bipolar
Turn up at the show I ain't even on the poster
I'm a weirdo but I'm not a bipolar
Turn up at your show, I ain't even on the poster

[Hook]
