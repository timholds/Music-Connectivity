[Verse 1]
I woke up early in the morning
Hoes blowin' up my phone
I ain't used to small talkin, when they know I'm tryna bone
Fuck 'em
I'll holla later, man
Right now my mind elsewhere
My Mom's healthcare, get'n out this hell here
A lot of niggas fail
Frail niggas won't prevail here
We seen it all man, niggas can't even spell scared
A Fresh Prince but yo my city ain't no Bel-Air
Fuck if you would sell, I'd worry bout my welfare
So farewell to them broke days and bonjour to the most paid
Soon as my dough straight
I throw the wifey in some Dolce
And put some chains on my niggas like I own slaves
I get up
Look out the window hope the sun shining
Down on my niggas out there front lining
I hit the streets and see them boys out
They locking up some older head
So Goddamn homey, hold your head
And hold your head

[Hook]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'mma make to the end though
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my
Headed for the sky, I'm on my way

[Verse 2]
Paint a picture to show the deaf what it's like to listen
And speak the words and tell a blind man what he missin'
For all my niggas doin' time man up in prison
Felt you had to resort to crime, man fuck the system
We raisin' babies up in Hades where there ain't no hope
Ain't no fathers, don't take no scholarship to slang no dope
Politicians hollerin' bout problems but I ain't gon' vote
He talk about change
Still we floatin' in the same ol' boat
So tell me how I'm supposed to feel when the President spoke
When he ain't never had to struggle
Ain't never been broke
Ain't even roll through the ghetto ain't neva been close
Trustin' this government's like trustin' the devil in oath
For rebel with quotes, I get up
Lifestyle of the young, black and reckless
A generation of niggas strapped and askin' questions like:
"Tell me why I ain't got shit?"
I let this liquor fill my liver with them toxics
As I sip

[Hook]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'ma make to the end though
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my
Headed for the sky, I'm on my way

[Verse 3]
Yeah, to all my niggas paper chasin'
I pray for your patience
Just keep the faith that you gon' make it one day you'll be cakin'
Takin' this shit one step at a time
That real shit is stuck on my mind
But to that bullshit I'm deaf and I'm blind
Destined to shine I'mma find a way
Cause hey
Damn it them jobs out there ain't tryna pay
I pray
Granted nine to five is how you survive
I ain't tryna survive, I'm tryna throw my Momma in rides
I'mma provide for my seed I'm the soil
I'll teach 'em bout' loyalty
I'll teach 'em that his skin black like oil that's for royalty
I'll show 'em all the things that my pops was never showin' me
Treat 'em like a growin' tree with this poetry
I get up
And show the sons how to lead not to follow
The present is our gift but our seed's got tommorow
So please niggas raise your kids
And help em' overcome that bull shit they daze us with
I blaze the shit

[Hook]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'ma make to the end though
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my
Headed for the sky, I'm on my way

[Hook]
I get up
I see the clouds from my window
I pray the sun gon' shine this way
And where I go as the wind blow
Momma your son gon' find his way
And if I gotta crawl I'ma make to the end though
Up to the top if climb my way
And tell 'em I'ma rise, I'm on my
Headed for the sky, I'm on my way
