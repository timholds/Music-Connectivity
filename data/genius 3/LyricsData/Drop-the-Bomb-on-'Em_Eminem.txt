[Intro]
Yeah, boy
Them better ring the alarm, boy
Them know what's coming, boy
Bluh! Bluh-Bluh! Haha
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
Oh my God
Fucking bumbaclot
I'm hard as Kenard
The little boy who shot Omar in The Wire
Tie a whore up with barbed wire
You're nothing but a brah, boy
I'm the real deal
And Charbroiler on the bonfire
And bon voyage, bitch
I'm like Chef Boyardee in this bitch
Send a bomb to my mom's lawyer
I'm a problem for you, boy
You think you're Tom Sawyer
Until I pull you out the fuckin' storybook and stomp on ya
Fuckin' ficti-tional characters and fairy tales
Prepare yourself
For Captain America on Ferris wheels
But it ain't fiction
It's fact boy, beware, it's real
Them lyrics you wield
Equal zero to a hero's shield
Mr. Fly by the seat of his pants parasail
Fall, hit the trampoline, bounce, and grab a pair of stilts
And I ain't wearing zilch
Zip, zero, nothing; no, nada
Like your fatha fucking your motha

[Hook]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me

[Verse 2]
Boy, I'm the Real McCoy
You little boys can't even fill voids
Party's over, kids, kill the noise
Here come the killjoys
Me and Dre the steel alloys
The rap Crown Royals
That scalp cowboys
Now, how that sound for you?
Yeah boy, you know we're about to put it down for you
So kick your shoes off in the foyer
Have a sound voyage
And sayonara
See you fuckers tomorrow
Get some R&R
And marinate in some marinara
And have a Coke and a smile
Don't make me open a jar
Of whip-ass on you
That's the last straw you're hopin' to draw
Yeah, you're fresher than most
Boy, I'm just doper than all
Boy, I'm that boy, boy
Them boys, them no up to par
I just show up
Go up to the stage
And blow up the spot
There ain't no boy who can do what I do
Boy, I'm a star
Boy, I told you, boy
I'm a soldier boy, I'm Deshaun
Holton in this bitch
I'm the Proof, boy, you're a fraud
I'll destroy you, boy
Fuck around and blow you to sod
Oh my God, boy
You didn't go there, no you did not
I got a whole storyboard for you
Boy, you're the plot
You're gettin' got
Whether you try to avoid it or not
Apology not accepted, boy
Detroit is a rock
We get to beefin'
Ain't no tellin' at what point it'll stop
All I got to do is point to the spot
When the bomb drops
Boy, does it drop
And when it does, boy, there's a problem

[Hook]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me

[Verse 3]
Boy, don't jinx yourself
Boy, I'm Micheal Spinks with the belt
Stringer Bell
Boy, my name rings bells for itself
I'm sick as hell
Boy, you better run and tell someone else
Bringing hell
Boy, sing them telegrams and get dealt
And to that boy on them sedative meds
Who said he was better
I bet he never seen Freddy
In a black and red little sweater
Back, better than ever
The cheddar shredder
The grater
The beef grinder
I'll settle vendettas a little later
Giving haters incubators
Think you made a mistake
By saying Shady was ghost
I ain't even close to the gate
You got one foot in the grave
Just stay put and behave
I'm 'bout to turn this fuckin' place
To Beirut in a day
So, hey, wouldn't you say I'm the shit?
Couldn't agree with you more
If you were to say that my fuckin' shit doesn't stink
Shady fucking Aftermath, boy
The ship doesn't sink
It just floats in the fuckin' water 'til we fill up the tank

[Hook]
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
Please don't drop the bomb on me
Shady, please, please don't drop the bomb on me
Drop the bomb on 'em
I don't want no doggone beef, see
Ain't no reason to sick the dogs on me
