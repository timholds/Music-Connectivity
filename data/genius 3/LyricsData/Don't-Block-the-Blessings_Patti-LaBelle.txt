There's no such a thing as a broken heart
It can't be shattered, can't be torn apart
It won't start bleeding when love seems gone
It just keeps beating on and on and on and on
Someday this hurt that I feel will pass
These tears I cry over you won't last
I know my dreams won't really die
And there's life for me so much life when I
One by one I learn, don't block the blessing
See all the love that still surrounds my life
Step by step I'll move out of the darkness
And make my way in to the light
There's no gain living in the past
Wishing for yesterdays we no longer have
Each new moment brings me some
Brand new chance to overcome
One by one I learn, don't block the blessings
See all the love that still surrounds my life
Step by step I moved out of darkness
And made my way in to the light
There's no gain living in the past
Wishing for yesterdays we no longer have
Each new moment brings me some brand new chance
I think I will overcome
Don't block the blessings
Don't give up what ever you do
Don't block the blessings
Good things will hapeen for you
