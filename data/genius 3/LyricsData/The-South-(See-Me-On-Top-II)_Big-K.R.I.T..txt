[Intro]
Mississipi Nigga (Mississippi playa)
Ay check me out

[Verse 1]
I ain't got time for these niggas out here that's steady hating
[?] just copped them Chevy so knock us niggas skating
Hip hip to the end of this expedition that we've been taking
Headed down to Jackson just the see what the fuck was shakin
I told them niggas I'm the realest of the real
I've got that gangster, gangster, gangster of grills
So a nigga wanna know bout me from the 3OB, that block I'm from
Where niggas don't play around [?] spray around [?] got them guns
See what I mean my nigga, see what I'm saying cuz
While you was running yo mouth we out here making bucks
Turn on TV screen and see CT300 on BET
We at the block on the 12's [?] diamond and DVD
I been a G forever forever that's what I be
I turn this G style like a bitch that wants to fuck with me
Too many niggas done fell victim tryna battle me
Why have you got the life that [?] cavalry
Pull up run up cut up cut up watch me get deep up in em
And keep going going going like hood cat spitters
You niggas is uptight like a broad with some fucked up extensions
I know more niggas with white than a triple K convention
Back again shawty shawty with all that crunk shit
Make a nigga girate and fall out just like all that crunk shit
Know men know me K.R.I.T yeah I put shit down
The only mainstream martyrs thats still underground
Follow me to the South, follow me to the streets
If you can't keep up my nigga follow me on the beat
I got a reputation for wreckin and that's for sure
I got the game in a choke hold and I ain't letting go
I'm on a mission familiar player I stop for nothing
Unless there's dimes on my side and they steady twerkin something
They know they quote it the poet yo guess I'm bouts to blow
I love this music but truly nigga i'm bout my dough

[Outro]
And the boys wanna know about the [?]
