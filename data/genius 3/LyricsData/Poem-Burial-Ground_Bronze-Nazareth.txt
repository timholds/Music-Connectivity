[Intro: movie sample (Bronze Nazareth)]
This is sacred land, my father's land
(Yo, yo, yeah, yeah, yo.. yeah, yeah
Yo, yeah-yeah-yeah.. yo)

[Bronze Nazareth]
My ratherness thought, savages taught, madness we brought
Actions and hagglers assault, records match dastardly coughs
Graphics evolve, flash the magic is brought
You lack sight, muthafucka, your swords & masters is dull
We grappling dough, evac' in shackles and cuffs
Mathematical snuffs, madness is lust, I had to construct
Actions involved, flashin' what's tucked, passin' his grimiest muck
A butcher had struck, hackin' his surface and skulls
Lackin' a purpose for rational reason, for swinging it hard
My grandyears handwriting on walls, I send lightning through halls
That strike like Wolverine claws
Raps are bullets that soar, through cartelege of ya jaw
Filaments, ligaments tore, that's how a Pillage is born
I'm spillin' your soul, like wolves with the braids in the comb
My halo is old, got it from grandad when he died
Beagle sad eagle eyes, stay dark, as broke as street lights
Deep as ocean sea life, need me like gambler's need dice
Shambles and hoods with street bite, that's why I couldn't see right
Once said this couldn't be life, it hits like three pipes
I'm still ill as three sick slaves, dig emcees deepest grave
Legs meet this amnesia shave, I bleed on pave
Them sleep with waves, nigga, read each page

[Interlude: movie sample]
It rests on thirteen acres of Earth
Over the very center of Hell
He here is the first to offer, to the daring
To look into the final madning space
Between life, and death
With sights and sounds far beyond anything you tested
Avoid fainting...

[Bronze Nazareth]
My sinister stings, glammer like minister's rings
Echo like singers who sings, in hills, and valleys of kings
Alleys and gallery armed, Malory Gatling cold heart
Trap you when powerline sparks, outdine and follow my heart
Archery shower of darts, cowards with flowers depart
Calculus algebra horror, falcon beak, arrowhead sharp
Marriage your marrow in barks, stare at a mirror and crack it
Carnage with targets and ratchets, suspense condense when I ham' it
Like keeping arms in our jackets, our fondest verse like a harness
The crowd's they know my informats, dying of thirst in the phantom
Driving a hearse through your basement, my K-nicks just game in
Feeding the bite for they say amen
Peeling cotton and slaving, that's how the blaze feel
Like bottles, my kiss of death might of got you
Stocking my shelter with gospel, hot like lava on the bodies of models
Why I'm an apostle, hospital cutthroat
My God, who sent you, ask the MC from a new slope
I'm boggling kinfolk, modeling bottling pinstrokes
I'm well for your mental, your pour with chains of the limo
Language is terminal, since urban sermons is burning you
Lyrical seep through, brain angles from deep throats
Chemical alchemy too, throw you from balcony stoopes
Isin't he, too, sick, like that chronic fatigue
Deeper than subtonic leaves, pull trees, it's Wu Free

[Outro: movie sample]
What happened was true
The most brutal series of crimes in America
This is just as real, just as close
Just as terrifying as being there
Even if one of them survives, what will be left?
After you stop screaming, you'll start talking about it
