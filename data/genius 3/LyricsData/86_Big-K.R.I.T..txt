[Pre-hook]
Now usually I talk about that Cadillac on vogues
But today it's all about Monte Carlo, propped up on lows
I set it out, I set it out, I set it out for sure
I keep it cooler than a polar bear's toes
You better hop in before I close that door

[Hook]
86, 86, 86
Kill 'em KRIT, 86, 86
Kill 'em KRIT, 86, 86
Kill 'em KRIT, 86, 86
Kill 'em

[Verse 1]
They're like
There he go again talking 'bout that candy paint
Slabbin' out, working wheel in the daytime
Don't settle for the trap, hi-hats and the clap
Bih', what you know about that bassline
Big booming, slip the lever
Haters grip for the backseat of the car like a fallen star
All these screens of light, I can charge at night
Ladies drink for free when they' at the bar
Pull up, barely stood up
High fiving every old school player tippin' in the lot
With a couple pretty things on they' shoulders
Then they told her "Krizzle gotta give 'em what you got"
So I kill 'em with the low
Joe Lewis knocking down doors
Grippin that wheel
They like "What happened to the lac?"
I told 'em 'bout this muscle

[Pre-hook]
Now usually I talk about that Cadillac on vogues

86, 86, 86
Kill 'em KRIT, 86, 86
Kill 'em KRIT, 86, 86
Kill 'em KRIT, 86, 86
Kill 'em

[Verse 2]
Dynamic, panoramic
I ain't seen the roof since you seen mine
Forgiato, paint melado
When you seen me, shawty you seen shine
Glass house, I put the ass out
When I roll supreme, I call it creepin' clean
I hit the gas on the low when I'm on the scene
Ya I be waking up them neighbors with the 15's when I vroom
Candy paint on the fleet
6 deep with the slab, ballin' in these street
Pull up on the curb - what the fuck, what you heard?
I swang and I swerve, I'm swangin' for keeps
That's that old school flow
Sugar Ray knocking down doors
Grippin' that wheel
They like "What happened to the lac?"
I told 'em 'bout this muscle

[Pre-hook]
Now usually I talk about that Cadillac on vogues
But today it's all about Monte Carlo, propped up on lows
I set it out, I set it out, I set it out for sure
I keep it cooler than a polar bear's toes
You better hop in before I close that door

[Hook]
86, 86, 86
Kill 'em KRIT, 86, 86
Kill 'em KRIT, 86, 86
Kill 'em KRIT, 86, 86
Kill 'em

[Bridge x2]
86 kill like that right there
Creep up slow like that right there
Monte Carlo like that right there
Yeen seen nothing like that right there
86 (x8)
