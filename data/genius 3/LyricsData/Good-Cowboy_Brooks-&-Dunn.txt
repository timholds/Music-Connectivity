[Verse]
Say things to me like a cowgirl would
I'll do tricks for you like a cowboy should
You look romantic laying in the hay
I need you tonight in a new kinda way
When you look at me with those eyes
It makes me start to fantasize
Do it to me like I know you could
So I can do it to you baby like a Cowboy should
Riding the range I think of you
I dig your chili you know it's true
Make big money put it in the bank
That longhorn caddy got a great big tank
You're the kinda woman who's above the rest
Nothing for me but the best
You say you need a fella who really can
Do it you good like a cowboy man
Got a massive wardrobe of cowboy clothes
From the top of my head to the tip of my toes
Ah, you look so good in my hat with fringe on it
So put on my boots ,doggone it

[Outro]
Do it to me baby like I now you can
And I can do it to you honey like a good cowboy should
