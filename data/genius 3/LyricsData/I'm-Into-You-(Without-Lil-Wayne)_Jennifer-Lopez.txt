[Intro]
Na na na na na na, eh
Na na na na na na, eh
Na na na na na na, eh
Na na na na na na, eh

[Verse 1]
You got me and I could not defend it
I tried, but I had to surrender
Your style got me under the spell
Let me no other choice but to get down

[Pre-Chorus
It’s too late, it’s too late
It’s too late, it’s too late
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
When I look into your eyes, it’s over
You got me hooked with your love controller
I’m tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah

Na na na na na na, eh
Na na na na na na, eh
Na na na na na na, eh
Na na na na na na, eh

[Verse 2]
Listen, now I’m strong, baby, I bring the fire on
Sharp shooter, you can call me "The Zion"
I’m not the one easy to get to
But all that changed, baby, when I met you

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s too late, it’s too late
It’s too late, it’s too late
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
When I look into your eyes, it’s over
You got me hooked with your love controller
I’m tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah

Na na na na na na, eh
Na na na na na na, eh
Na na na na na na, eh
Na na na na na na, eh

[Verse 3]
I'm not burning and I'm feeling you boy
Get it on if you feeling my world now
I love the way that you moving
And I'm listening to how you grooving
So if you need me, just call on the crew

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
When I look into your eyes, it’s over
You got me hooked with your love controller
