Quick to tell a bad bitch
To take a grip
Quick to tell a bad bitch
Run a lot
And she gonna take it out of town
And run it back
And she gonna take it out of town
And run it back
Cause I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it like that

Yeah I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it like that

The talkin nigga
Im about the action
I could sing a love song like a Jackson
And still slide through your black
She love R&B niggas with a passion
I could break a bitch down to a fraction
They love Jake&Papa like their momma cookin'
These niggas hatin'
Like they hate their momma's whippin

Young telephone guy
They say lalalala
Lalalala
Say lalalala
Lalalala

They get a JP
Baby follow me
I can fuck you so good
Just enjoy and see
Running one nigga with my finger on the trigger

Quick to tell a bad bitch
To take a grip
Quick to tell a bad bitch
Run a lot
And she gonna take it out of town
And run it back
And she gonna take it out of town
And run it back
Cause I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it like that

Yeah I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it like that

The talkin nigga
Im about to action
[Lyrics from: http://www.lyrics.az/jake-and-papa/-/i-got-it.html]
Go one take my pinky ring off and go on to slappin
The way I run a play
You think Im
I hate niggas
They make me sick to my stomach
Hatin ass niggas make sick to my stomach
I keep it cool
Come my momma
Tell me good
But deep down man I wish a nigga would

I put it on it until she lick it
And weakin
Every time you gonna fuck with me
It will be a hell of an evening
The thing is to be faithful nigga
You must be dreaming

Im the player from the 818
I get dope by the pound
Cause Im not that great
So if I tell her to run around
She gonna believe
And she gonna put her Nikes on and spread like at the Olympics

Quick to tell a bad bitch
To take a grip
Quick to tell a bad bitch
Run a lot
And she gonna take it out of town
And run it back
And she gonna take it out of town
And run it back
Cause I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it like that

Yeah I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it like that

Quick to tell a bad bitch
To take a grip
Quick to tell a bad bitch
Run a lot
And she gonna take it out of town
And run it back
And she gonna take it out of town
And run it back
Cause I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it like that

Yeah I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it
I got it, I got it like that
