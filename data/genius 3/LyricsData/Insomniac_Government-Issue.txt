I'm lying here in my bed
All lifes' problems on my head
I write about the things I see
I sing about you and me
Lyrics are rolling round and round
Gotta get up and write 'em down
Stupid assholes with big mouths
Stupid screaming outside my house
Open eyes in the night
What'll happen when I die
Thinking about what's her name sick of playing this stupid game
Sex is wrong sex is barred
Try to change my thoughts but it's getting hard
Why even bother with this thing
When you're not even listening
I can't get to sleep
