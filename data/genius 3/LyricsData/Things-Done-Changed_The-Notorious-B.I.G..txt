[Hook x4]
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

[Verse 1]
Remember back in the days when niggas had waves
Cazal shades and corn braids
Pitching pennies, honeys had the high-top jellies
Shooting skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly
Lounging at the barbecues, drinking brews
With the neighborhood crews, hanging on the avenues
Turn your pages to 1993
Niggas is getting smoked, G: believe me
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick
Cause real street niggas ain't having that shit
Toting Tecs for rep
Smoking blunts in the project hallways
Shooting dice all day
Wait for niggas to step up on some fighting shit
We get hype and shit and start lighting shit
So step away with your fist-fight ways
Motherfucker, this ain't back in the days
But you don't hear me though

[Hook x4]
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

[Verse 2]
No more coco-levio 1, 2, 3
1, 2, 3... all it is to me, is a mystery
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it
But I stay seeing bodies with the motherfucking chalk around it
And I'm down with the shit too
For the stupid motherfuckers want to try to use Kung-Fu
Instead of a MAC-10, he tried scrapping
Slugs in his back and that's what the fuck happens
When you sleep on the street
Little motherfuckers with heat wanna leave a nigga six feet deep
And we coming to the wake
To make sure the crying and commotion ain't a motherfucking fake
Back in the days our parents used to take care of us
Look at 'em now, they even fuckin' scared of us
Calling the city for help because they can't maintain
Damn, shit done changed

[Hook x4]
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
Remember they used to thump but now they blast, right

[Verse 3]
If I wasn't in the rap game
I'd probably have a key knee-deep in the crack game
Because the streets is a short stop
Either you're slinging crack rock or you got a wicked jump shot
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums
Eating 5 cent gums, not knowing where your meal's coming from
And now the shit's getting crazier and major
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky brand pagers
Going out of town, blowing up
Six months later, all the dead bodies showing up
It make me wanna grab the 9 and the shotty
But I gotta go identify the body
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts
Every time I turn around, a nigga getting took out
Shit, my Momma got cancer in her breast
Don't ask me why I'm motherfucking stressed, things done changed

[Hook x4]
Back in the day
Things done changed on this side
