I still got my sub ho (ho)
I still got my sub ho (ho)
I still got my sub ho (ho)
I still got my sub ho (ho)
I still got my sub ho (ho)
I still got my sub ho (ho)
I still let my trunk knock til the tape pop
My rims chop chop while my bass knock
(Nigga wut?)
I done cut up my bang and shook up the stars (Nigga wut?)
(Nigga wut?) (Shook up the stars)
I done cut up my bang and shook up the stars (Nigga wut?)
(Nigga wut?) (Shook up the stars)
I done cut up my bang and shook up the stars (Nigga wut?)
(Nigga wut?) (Shook up the stars)
I done cut up my bang and shook up the stars (Nigga wut?)
(Nigga wut?) (Shook up the stars)

[Verse 1]
Young Krizzle I'm back again
Old school and I'm backin' out
Country boy still rep that rep that
Hit the bass and I'm actin' out
On the ave with a bad bitch stackin' clouds
Show a pimp what that ass about
In the parkin' lot deep while the whole world sleep
Pourin out hennessy 'til I'm passin' out
Gotta keep my eyes open cause I heard that five scopin'
For the car with the big ass sub and the top chopped off, so I drive slowly
Fuckin' bangin' in the back wood like a lac' should with the lights bright, windows tinted
Stopped at the gas station for a bag of chips
A fountain drink and some peppermints just to freshen up
Shawty say she down to fuck
But we gotta make a move cause it's after 2
And her man is the type to bust, she frightened of em' but I ain't though
Now she wonder what she came for
But I ain't trippin' no place, I ain't even gonna flip
Over another nigga bitch, move over to the next

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
(I still got my sub ho) jammin' on that drug flow
King Kong's in my trunk, in a fight with my thump, better let my sub go
Shawty in the front seat proceed to get high as fuck
She ain't worried 'bout her man no more
Hell, he don't know how to treat his ho
That nigga never ever slam no doors
I thought I saw some light but I'm trippin'
I gotta bust this right 'fore I miss it
I hit the super 8 because it's super late and she know the way and I dig it
All in my ear, have no fear, says she wanna fuck with me
Well, I told 'er that's all good while she grip my wood but a pimp don't fuck for free
She laughed and answered her phone, I swear it's 3 in the morn'
Like who could that be, she looked at me like he won't leave me alone
Well thats a damn shame, he don't know my name and I ain't got no time wit' yo folks
Lets just get this room and do what we do and be up out this thang around 4

[Hook]
