[Verse 1]
A hundred miles an hour
Out on highway 10
Top down burning up the night again
Ain't no one can catch you
But girl I'm going to try
I can see that dangerous look in your eyes

[Chorus]
You're my kind of crazy
Full moon saying you know what I like
How about it baby
Let's you and I go out and get crazy tonight

[Verse 2]
I saw you at the drive-in
Dancing on a car
Rocking to the radio underneath the stars
Living every moment like it was your last
Don't know where you're going
You're just going fast

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I ain't afraid of nothing
When I'm out with you
Running through the shadows
Chasing down the moon
Pushing to the limit
Isn't far enough
Let's go off the edge
And fall all the way in love

[Chorus][x3]
