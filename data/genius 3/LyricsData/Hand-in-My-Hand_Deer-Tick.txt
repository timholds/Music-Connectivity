Everybody is alone in this world
Touches feeling close but never touching
And everyone is alone

So long as I'm awake
I'll never dream alone again
Everyone is rolling for themselves

She lives down Elk
I say it's a ghost town
When she's not, not around

Everybody is alone in this world
Touches feeling close but never touching
When everyone is alone

She don't need a thing
All I can do is give
That is some touches

She don't understand
I'll take her hand (in my hand)
Again and again

Everybody is alone in this world
Touches feeling close but never touching
And everyone, everyone is alone

I take her hand
In my hand
Again and again

Everybody is alone in this world
Touches feeling close but never touching
And everyone is alone
