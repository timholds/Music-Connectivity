(Olu)
Tunnel vision, Buggin' out
Awake but it feel like a lucid dream.
I might be tripping, Im zoning out
But I play it off when they look at me
I'm dilated see the evidence
Big bitch round me with her brights on
Like belly out shh bright as hell she swervin might have been slightly gone
The po-po's keep starin at us, The locals be glarin at us
Ro-mancing for the starter, I. this loud pack caused laryngitis
These beats got me near excited
That ass got me so excited
Ill bite the bullet, I'll kiss the rifle
I got the spins but I got the fight.(right)
Think im losin my mind
But it could be worse so im sure that im fine
Losing track of the time. my jacket or wallet
Or havin some glass, can't remember the night
In love with this dime. I think, about what she like
I might as give in and desire, cuz shorty's on fire
Kissin that pink eye and now she sings at the choir
Like haley maguire
This is my plight
The life
