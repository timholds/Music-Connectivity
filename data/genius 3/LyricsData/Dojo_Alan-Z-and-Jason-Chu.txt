Chorus
[Jason Chu]
你问我爱你多久
你问我开不开心
你来到在我 DOJO
你爱不在我的心

Verse 1
[Alan Z]
I’m what the game been lacking
Here to cause a chain reaction
To let greatness back in
Until these flunkies that’s making whack shit
Fades to blackness
Ain’t no caption needed, no Asian accent
I beat this game on legendary
Every stage I mastered
I spend my days in practice
To become this trained assassin
And my nights inside a famous actress
While she plays Miss Jackson
If you’re nasty, I’m Nas when he made Illmatic
I’m better than you at everything to a degree, I majored at it

[Jason Chu]
Yeah yeah it's the head boy
Beats banging hard fucking with your head, boy
I eat so much, why you ain't fed boy?
You need a life and you ain't even dead, boy
I'm running laps with good intent, you know the deal
Dim sum with Xiao Long Bao, you know the meal
Last drop, see the count, you know a mil
Tell 88Rising come on, write up a deal

[Alan Z]
Vicodin pills, couldn’t relieve the pain that I’m bringing
Women like my appeal, they scream my name when I’m singing
Turn them to SZA, make her feel Love Galore when I’m freakin'
She got a man but I got it covered for just The Weekend

[Jason Chu]
My old hair was lowkey Steve Aoki or Weeknd
My new hair more like, "Ooh yeah he clean"
2017, I rocked a lot of that Preme shit
This year it's Chinatown swap meet for the team shit

[Alan Z]
If you fall under that mumble rap, you don’t want to scrap
If you can’t spit 100 flat
Rather listen to Thundercat
This ain’t martial arts when I spar with y’all
I don’t mean Tekken
I mean taking over your block when I say I’m Marshall Law

[Jason Chu]
Who want to brawl? Come get it
Take a spin (You know) Come fidget
I want a yacht in the South of France
Golden Space Jams
A Skyline that drifts without no hands (Skrrrrt)

Chorus
[Jason Chu]
你问我爱你多久
你问我开不开心
你来到在我 DOJO
你爱不在我的心
[Alan Z]
你问我爱你多久
你问我开不开心
你来到在我 DOJO
你爱不在我的心

[Alan] It’s over, watch me come and stop your regime
[Jason] Dynasty, I’ma be honestly king
[Alan] Simba but I ain’t lyin', I was born to ascend
[Jason] I’m eyeing all of you tyrants, let the tourney begin
[Alan] You’re sparring now with a Spartan, but I ain’t signed to 300
Come step into my dojo and get killed if you really want it
[Jason] This rap shit is a homage, to those that came above us
You get wet up from your pad up if you step into my summit
BOIII
