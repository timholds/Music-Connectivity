Baby went off to summerschool and she didn't feel allright
Nobody spoke to her and she couldn't sleep at night
No one there knew what she had been through

If they ever make one baby we should go right ahead
Saturn freeway
Then we could reverse the violence
And go right ahead
Saturn freeway
Go right ahead

I'm just trying to cheer you up
But who am I to know
I never heard the shots they fired
Just glad they let you go

Don't feel sad now you are safe and sound
Don't be bad when it brings you down
I know a girl and she's still hiding

We could be like superman we could go right ahead
Saturn freeway
Then we could reverse the violence
Go right ahead
Saturn freeway
If they ever made one baby we should go right away
Saturn freeway
