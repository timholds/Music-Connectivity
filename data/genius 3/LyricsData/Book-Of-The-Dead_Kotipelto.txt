[Bonus track]

Since ancient times there's been
A need for some security
To make sure that after death
Our lives go on in eternity
We must be prepared
For our travel through the night
Without proper guidance
We'll be lost, never seeing the light

I am ready for
What lies ahead
I'll be guided by
The book of the dead

I've made sure that I can leave
My tomb when necessary
I've got the spells surrounding me
On the walls they are forming a scenery
A satisfactory afterlife
I know is secured
I feel the magic coming to me
And from all illness I will be cured

I am ready for
What lies ahead
I'll be guided by
The book of the dead
