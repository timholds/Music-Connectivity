"What you doin' man?"
"I think I'll go on down the corner"

One of the black boys said "I need none of your pity"
It's your mama that don't like you loose in the city
But stick about, take note, take a tip and take no back lip
Come closer, let me see you snap your fingertip

Because standing on my corner just might suit ya
Or maybe, baby, there's something else that you wanna do, yeah

Like rolling dice, nice
Like shooting pool, hey that's cool

I'm a little black boy and I don't know my place
I'm a little black boy and I just threw my ace
I'm a little black boy, recognize the face

One of the black boys said "I'm a-giving a warning"
"People been putting me down, I'm so tired I'm yawning"
A new suit, pretty boots to boot, I'm feeling slick, yeah
I'm gonna go to town, look around, pull a chick, yeah

Of course standing on the corner just might suit you
Or maybe, baby, there's something else that you wanna do, yeak

Like playing poker, joker
Like to back a race, ace

I'm a little black boy and I don't know my proper place
I'm a little black boy, get my head in it's space
I'm a little black boy and I just play my bass
I'm a little black boy and I just threw my ace
I'm a little black boy, recognize the face
