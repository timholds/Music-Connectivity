[Verse: Bless]
Look
Y’all wonder why my temperament’s annoyed
Had a vision this morning that Aaliyah bled, dying in my arms
So I broke up with my dreams, and fell in love with doubt for a second
Looking in the mirror, disgusted at what I see
Because we all live and die in a grave, so I can either man up or die as a slave to reality
I don’t count on being remembered by Aaliyah for walking around acting like my life was too fly for me
So when I hug them, I’ll make sure it means something, wait
Never mind that because my goal when I see her and her mother is to hug them tight
Then tell them that I love them, that’s a reminder to love your life
Look, I support God myself but F a life group; y’all don’t want me to like myself
People of God right? If I’m supposed to be ashamed for not praying in a day
Not everything is wrong dog
What makes y’all so important?
And what day did God write the bible because I really need to know
To know my name isn’t to know me, dog
To know me is to know me because slowly my remorse dies down
But that’s not important, right?
God fearing, my only flaw is my giving heart
And that’s conducive to being frugal and living smart
While the youth were just “living art”, I was suited for jumpings and one stabbing
I’m living being burned and being partially blind
But my peers never learned
Who should I take this out on?
Living my life without arms, without head, they live theirs without heart
Without three, they’d be dead in my thoughts
If I’m caught in this web again, destroying my five year old soul
And though I’m standoffish, that five year old knows
It’s a shame how most of you act grown, but never seem to show any growth
I would say that I’m a dream chaser, but if I’m chasing my dreams
How come it seems that no one’s seen waivers?
I mean, I’m a human being but wrists bleed when these people just won’t stop yelling louder than banshees
I’m like dang, please chill
Because we feel that even Aaliyah Peters has her own unique skills
On guard, my god, no more stress
If you think you’ve seen a threat, you ain’t seen one yet
This is Byron letting all of my demons through without knowing a thing about the people that I’m speaking to
In the midst of it all when I kill you dead, I’ll recall a call when I couldn’t resolve my own problems and let them fall down
Cause truthfully, I just started rapping to get away
I never knew that it would take this long for me to recover
Usually, y’all would blow a fuse, but not today
Because I struggle with these scars
Thank God for Aaliyah’s mother, what’s up?

[Outro: Bless and Aaliyah]
Say, I love you (I love you)
I love you BJ (I love you BJ)
Are you the Flying Baby?
(Yes, I'm the Flying Baby)
Good, I love you too
(I love you too)
