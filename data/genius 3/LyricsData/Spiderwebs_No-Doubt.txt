[Verse 1]
You think that we connect
That the chemistry's correct
Your words walk right through my ears
Presuming I like what I hear

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm stuck in the
The web you're spinning
You've got me for you prey

[Chorus]
Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message and I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back

[Verse 2]
You're intruding on what's mine
And you're taking up my time
Don't have the courage inside me
To tell you please let me be

[Pre-Chorus]
Communication
A telephonic invasion
I'm planning my escape

[Chorus]
Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message and I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back

[Post-Chorus]
And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls

[Bridge]
Now it's gone too deep
You wake me in my sleep
My dreams become nightmares
Cause you're ringing in my ears

[Chorus]
Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message and I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back

[Post-Chorus]
Oooh, the spiderwebs
Leave a message and I'll call you back
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So, leave a message and I'll call you back
I'm walking into spiderwebs
It's all your fault, no matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls
It's all your fault, it's all your fault
No matter who calls, no matter who calls

[Chorus]
Sorry I'm not home right now
I'm walking into spiderwebs
So leave a message and I'll call you back
A likely story, but leave a message
And I'll call you back

[Post-Chorus]
And it's all your fault
I screen my phone calls
No matter who calls
I gotta screen my phone calls
