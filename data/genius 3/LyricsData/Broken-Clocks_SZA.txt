[Verse 1]
Run fast from my day job
Runnin' fast from the way it was
Jump quick to a pay check
Runnin' back to the strip club
I'm never going back, never going back
No you can't make me
Never going back, never going back (nah)
They never take me (yeah)
I've paid enough of petty dues
I've heard enough of shitty news
I've had a thing for dirty shoes since I was 10
Love dirty men alike

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Better day than yesterday (keep cuttin' up)
Ooh oh
I just take it day by day
Ooh oh oh
Never hearing what they say
Ooh ooh
I just do it my way

[Chorus]
All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burning daylight
Still love and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love (still lovin'), still love
It's still love but it's still love
Nothin' but love for you (nothin' but)
Nothin' but love (nothin' but)
Nothin' but love

[Post-Chorus]
All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talking a lot, sorry I'm faded
Think I've forgot, you love me
You love me
You love me

[Verse 2]
Got a shift at 10 AM
Gotta dip at 10 PM
Gotta get that cash
Won't get past the lunch break
I ain't had a smoke break
In about two days don't break
Been about three years since I dated you
Why you still talking 'bout me like we together?
I moved on for the better
You moved on to whoever
I was down for whatever and then some
You gon' make me late to work again

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
Better day than yesterday
Ooh oh
I just take it day by day
Ooh oh oh
Never hearing what they say
Ooh ooh
I just do it my way (just do it)

[Chorus]
All I got is these broken clocks
I ain't got no time
Just burning daylight
Still love and it's still love, and it's still love
It's still love, still love, still love (still lovin')
It's still love but it's still love (still lovin')
Nothin' but love for you
Nothin' but love (nothin' but)
Nothin' but love

[Bridge]
I don't eat, can't sleep past 9 AM
Heartbeat make me feel young again (make me feel like a)
Can't beat em just join the party (come and join the party)
I don't wanna, don't need nobody

[Post-Chorus]
All that I've got, pieces and pages
Talking a lot, sorry I'm faded
Think I've forgot, you love me
You love me
You love me

[Outro]
You love me
You love me
You love me
