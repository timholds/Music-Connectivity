(B and Dee Money want millions)
(Bricks, this shit finna kill these niggas.)

[Chorus]
I just act a fool, never follow rules
Do what I wanna do, neck iced up wit jewels
Run up a check on a bitch
Mouth full of gold, look like piss
I ain’t have it back den, now a nigga livin' rich

[Verse]
I ain’t have shit when growing up
I ain’t ate in so long. I had throwed it up
Wanna take away the pain, so I roll it up
Westside by my neck so I throw it up
Talk bad on my name, but fuck it
Cause a young hoe still wanna fuck me
Y’all niggas just don’t know, all the shit I went through

[Chorus]
I just act a fool, never follow rules
Do what I wanna do, neck iced up wit jewels
Run up a check on a bitch
Mouth full of gold, look like piss
I ain’t have it back den, now a nigga livin rich

[Chorus]
I just act a fool, never follow rules
Do what I wanna do, neck iced up wit jewels
Run up a check on a bitch
Mouth full of gold, look like piss
I ain’t have it back den, now a nigga livin rich
