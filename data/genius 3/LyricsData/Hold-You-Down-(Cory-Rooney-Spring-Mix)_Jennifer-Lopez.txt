Stash cash in bags while you made your moves
And there ain't nothin' Hollywood wanna jump off
If there's a problem I'ma ride Joe at any cost
I'll be the one that reps strong for you
If all else fails, I'd do a pic with you

Man, these minions is vultures, and I'm sentenced to death

Who else hold it down like your nigga Joe Cartagena
I been spinnin' that raw since 9-2
Taken back, when I hit you with that Flow Joe track
Yeah I brought you that Pun, J. Lo's the same
Young boys try and imitate us, splittin' that game
I done took New York to new heights, then through fights
Let's call somebody, let's talk about it, now
They ain't never been a nigga more official
First they pretend to wanna love you, then they wanna diss you
I done seen it all
And I ain't tryin' to stress you, Lo
But I ain't got nowhere else to go

[Verse 2]:
(Jennifer):
Joe, I never gave you a reason to doubt
And there was never a time that I didn't look out
There's not a situation that we can't get through
There's never been a night I didn't pray for you (ooh-ooh)
See, I dedicate my life to the very end
'Cuz at the end of it all I know I had a friend
So let 'em all believe what they heard
I let my actions speak louder than words

[Verse 3]:
(Jennifer):
So anytime you need me for whatever
You can call my phone, we can handle this together
Shotgun by your side in the Carrera
It's all or nothin', that's how we do it, yeah
On top of everything I'm still that chick
To hold you down 'cuz my pockets are thick
'Cuz you know I do that movie-shi-, that runway-shi-
Not to compare me to your average bi---
[Rap 3]:
(Joe):
All or nothin', how I feel these days
Hate stronger than tsunami waves
I know you know the feelin'
Talkin' about that tabloid-shi-
Paparazzi, they can suck my-UNH

[Bridge]:
(Joe):
Well I guess, I guess they know now
When it comes to holdin' you down
Everybody know how I get down (yeah, yeah)
