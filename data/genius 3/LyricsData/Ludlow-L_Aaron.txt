You pushed the boundaries of this world
My head was leaning on the wall
I closed my eyelids and I saw you
Our two shapes waltzing in the snow

Is this day meant to be remembered?
Will I one day forget your name?
Are you the wind that blows my words?
Are you the drugs that I have chased?

Ludlow Street is the witness
Of your missing footsteps in the snow
All the neighborhood has been swallowed
Up By a white cloud filled with hope

You pushed the boundaries of this world
My head was leaning on the wall
I closed my eyelids and I saw you
Our two shapes waltzing in the snow

Sleep monster, the future's coming
I'm just an empty bottle in the night
I was just gone for a night ride
To a place where fever has no end...
