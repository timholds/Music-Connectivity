(DJ Paul)
Yeah, we back up in this mothafucka
Prophet motherfuckin' Posse ho
Three 6 mafia, M-Child
A whole bunch of mothafuckas
And ready to do this shit
You wanna fuck a ho
Then Wait until you're back
When the war's gone bitch
You better recognize you motherfuckin' suckas
Thinkin' that I'm for the 9-7
Once again, it's on
Bout to pull yo' motherfuckin' ass in bitch
Woow, woow, woow woow woow woo

(DJ Paul)
Now when they comes to the hood
I be like black in my zone
Now when it comes to parts of the body
I got more than Autozone
In the middle of fashion I got to keep it like rockin'
And people callin' it green
That smoke how much I like it
Again it's up to him
I need to let some shots off
And Dj Paul with Teflon also take that bulletproof off
But when they jump, I pump
To put some murderin' punks
And then I dumped all his bodyparts into my trunk

(Lord Infamous)
Scarecrow
Play
I'mma terror from The End
I'll watch that body explode
If they retaliate I blast
I think about you won't find them bloody clothes
Kill 'em though
Don't you know
I want to get rid of those faked up hoes
It's the city of Memphis
Watch me witness how this nigga unload
Rage make me regularly, force me blood
I feed ya' hot lead slugs and watch you drip like fudge
I'm nuts
You got no crips
You got no heart
You niggas from the start
I want to fill my fucking backyard with your bodyparts

(Gangsta Boo)
Wussup mista trick
Do you wanna get with this
Pimp type ass bitch down with the Triple 6
My Lexus trunk or Viper
Prophet Posse nothin' nicer
In this fuckin' body parts through the air
Cause we come to get it crunk
Several bodies in my trunk
Never denyin', always highin'
Fuck you playa hatin punks
Always stayin' on the top
Look at the Billboard Charts
Prophet Posse takin' over
Nigga now we got you high

(M-Child)
I don't know you
Why the fuck you all in my grill
I'm stackin' buck on you niggas, stay so so trill
You ain't no killa
My niggas leave a schedule
Go to sleep
Sleepin' with the lights on, ho you caustious of me
Me and about 80 mo' motherfuckas who comin'
Throwin' 5 billion (??)
While your bitch ass runnin'
We be the Prophet definition meanin' click so tight
M-Child, Orange Mound, smokin' out every night, BITCH!!!!

(Juicy J)
I met this fool last week
Who said he slangin' double keys
Also had a group of bustin' all tall and some like, green ink
What you think
I was tryin' to plan a robbin' spree
So I drove a low key car
Tryin' to fool the streets
Curve after curve
I return tryin' not to swerve
Knowin' by the hour I be chippin' up my bag of herbs
(??) herb AK's all kinds a guns
Till the nigga pulled his car to the side and stopped the run

(Scanman)
Please don't test these murderers
Slugs I will pump at your gut
Scan from the Killa Klan Kaze
I will dump your bodyparts into my trunk
Let's go ride then play a game
What's the game
The game of names
Now which, which one would you choose
Which ever you choose you lose, you lose

(Droopy Drew Dog)
First Time on the maximum, don't be a trick
To see them hatas talk shit but they don't know the deal
Dope sella
BHZ's where I dwell-ah
They looked into the barrel of my chin black Barretta
Ratta Tatta is all you heard
To see you niggas comin' up
In the (???)
But watch the game
Cause you don't got no friends
Droopy Drew Dog self made to the end

(Crunchy Blac)

Bullet lead two to the head
Then I lay them in graves

(Project Pat)
Slammin' bones, throwin' leaks

Trigger happy, nappy headed, set it don't you see me

And if the police pull us over

(Indo G)
Jackin' and packin' and takin' those fakin' ass bitches
That thinkin' that all of us is red instead
While I drop this track
