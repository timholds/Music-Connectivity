Put up, Baby Face
I love your lipstick, Baby Face
It makes me all shades of red
Give me wild while you do to me one
Make me hot when I should be sleeping in my bed
I love your big eyes, Baby Face
They seem to suggest much more than you say
I love the mark in your secret place, oow Baby Face
Love is like a peppermint machine, that's green, it's green
I love your hair down, Baby Face
And I can picture ya as you do, oow, with your fingers running through
I love ya, Baby Face
The way you bite your lips, ooo...ow!
How 'bout (the) Baby Face? {repeat 17 times}
