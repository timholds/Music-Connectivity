Old man Wrigley lived in that white house
Down the street, where I grew up
Momma used to send me over with things
We struck a friendship up

I spent a few long summers, out on his old porch swing

Said he was in the war when in the navy
Lost his wife, lost his baby
Broke down and asked him one time
How ya keep from going crazy

He said I'll see my wife and son in just a little while
I asked him what he meant, he looked at me and smiled said

I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth, in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life, than just what I can see
Oh I believe

Few years later I was off at college
Talkin' to mom on the phone one night
Getting all caught up on the gossip
The ins and outs of the small town life

She said oh by the way son, old man Wrigley's died

Later on that night, I laid there thinkin' back
Thought about a couple long-lost summers, I didn't know whether to cry or laugh
If there was ever anybody, deserved a ticket to the other side
It'd be that sweet old man, who looked me in the eye, said

I raise my hands, bow my head
I'm finding more and more truth, in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to life, than just what I can see

I can't quote the book, the chapter or the verse
You can't tell me, it all ends, in a slow ride in a hearse
You know I'm more and more convinced, the longer that I live
Yeah, this can't be, no this can't be, no this can't be all there is

Lord I raise my hands, bow my head
Oh I'm finding more and more truth, in the words written in red
They tell me that there's more to this, than just what I can see (Just what I can see)
I believe, oh I

I believe
I believe

(I believe) Hmm
(I believe) Well I believe
(I believe) I believe
