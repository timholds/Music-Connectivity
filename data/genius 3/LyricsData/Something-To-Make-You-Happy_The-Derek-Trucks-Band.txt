I see the people
Starvin' in rags
I see my brother
Lyin' down with a pain
I hear the babies cryin'
To their Father God
Askin' Him why you lettin' me born into this world
Goodbye sorrow's rain
I turned around
And I looked at you my darlin'
If we don't stand together they'll try to make us stand alone

It's strange, it's a wonder but it's true
Every time I look at you
There's something I got to do

Something to make you happy
Come on just let me know
If there's nothing to make you happy
Just say the word and I'll go

I see the battle lines
Forming slowly
I see a silence fall
As the winners and the losers take their stand
I turned around
And I hear you call me darlin'
If we don't spread love through the land
It'll sure enough be dry

It's strange, it's a wonder but it's true
Every time I look at you
There's something I got to do

Something to make you happy
Come on just let me know
If there's nothing to make you happy
Just say the word and I'll go
