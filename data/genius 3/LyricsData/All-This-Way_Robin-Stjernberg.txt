We made it through storms
We made it through rain
It's been a long way and now I'm here
Trying to get back but you gave me
You don't need to save me, you've broke my fears
So baby hold on
Now that we come so far
Just listen to your heart
You don't have to save me
Just need you to follow
Cause we made it all this way
I won't ever give up
Of something that's so strong
Yeah, we made it all this way
Like the new castle's of time
Give me wings so I can fly
You'll always save me
I need you to follow
Cause we made it all this way
We made it this far gotta hold on on
It's a part of this road and then they get through
I open my eyes and I feel strong
I just need to know I'm here with you, oh
So baby hold on
Now that we come so far
Just listen to your heart
You don't have to save me
Just need you to follow
Cause we made it all this way
I won't ever give up
Of something that's so strong
Yeah, we made it all this way
Like the new castle's of time
Give me wings so I can fly
You'll always save me
Just need you to follow
Cause we made it all this way
You don't have to save me
Just need you to follow
Cause we made it all this way
I won't ever give up
Of something that's so strong
Yeah, we made it all this way
Like the new castle's of time
Give me wings so I can fly
You'll always save me
Just need you to follow
Cause we made it all this way
