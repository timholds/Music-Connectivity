[Denver Jonez] This is the remix

[Hook] She don't know I'm serious when I told her I loved her
She don't take me serious when I told her I loved her
All she said was
(OMG) When I told her I loved her
She don't take me serious when I told her I loved her (OMG)
(LOL)

[Verse 1: Denver Jonez] She don't know I'm serious when I lay up in my room, dreaming
You can be the bride, I'm the groom
Yeah we're gettin' married one day or another
I love ya
Girl there's no one above ya
Runnin' for cover
Arrow to my heart
Cupid where you at?
You really need to stop
I need another chance, let's take it from the top
It's like we're meant to be our hearts set on lock
You heard what I said feelin' like newly weds
Everytime I see you different tunes in my head
Far away image but soon come instead
Love weighs me down like baloon filled with lead
I think that I really miss you
I think I really need a kiss from you boo
Anything you do, everything you do
Got me wishin' on a star I hope it comes true

[Hook] She don't know I'm serious, when I told her I loved her
She don't take me serious when I told her I loved her
All she said was
(OMG) When I told her I loved her
She don't take me serious when I told her I loved her (OMG)
(LOL)

[Verse 2: Young Mix] Anytime I think of you you're just like dynamite
Cannot ever sit it right
Even when I spit it right
Even with the auto-pilot cannot ever fly it right
Baby your beauty's outta control, you're so outta sight
Evertime I think about you in the day and night
I love to say your name baby girl, gotta say it twice
Lay it right
Baby girl even gotta pray at night
You caress my heart even when I like to stay uptight
Lovin' your presence in the public or at home
Double date: 2 girls, me, and Denver Jonez
Can't leave me alone
Heir to you, a queen, to a female version throne
Together on the phone
Let's get it on
Pop it blast off together, then we're gone
Love you when you're right and even when you're wrong
If you're feelin' what I'm saying then go ahead and sing along

[Hook] She don't know I'm serious when I told her I loved her
She don't take me seious when I told her I loved her
All she said was
(OMG) When I told her I loved her
She don't take me serious when I told her I loved her (OMG)
(LOL)

[Verse 3: Denver Jonez] Got me thinkin' bout' what it could've been, should've been
Back against the wall, don't take me to the hood again
I know it makes you sad when you see me out there hustlin'
Do what I gotta do baby if you're strugglin'
The things in my past leave me with a frown again
Do it all over if it means that you'll smile again
I was blind, didn't see you were my friend and
Beautiful princess dove, no Indian
Broken hearts, no tears repitition
Snap my fingers, tears gone no magician
Lonely nights leave my head splittin'
No girls, no huggin' no kissin'
Christian, Kristin, Tiffany, Alissa, Korina, Amber, Amber I miss ya
And all the girls I didn't metion, won't forget ya
Heart breakin' ice cold like a blizzard

[Hook] She don't know I'm serious when I told her I loved her
She don't take me serious when I told her I loved her
All she said was
(OMG) When I told her I loved her
She don't take me serious when I told her I loved her (OMG)
(LOL)
