[Intro: J Cole]
LA, NC, NY
The Chi, yea, hey, yea

[Verse 1: J Cole]
I wake up, hop out the shower spray cologne on while im dressing
They hollering about recession so my niggas out here stressing
But bitch, Im live and breathing so to me that there’s a blessing
See life is like a test that I ain't never got no “F” in
Stepping out today, I got leave the crib
Momma stressing , I pray
That ain't no body gon’ pull the weapon out and spray
Cuz I don’t got no strap
And ever since we hit the depression niggas don't know how to act
In, fact there goes some niggas there
Hating, I feel the stare
Me vs you shining is like a diamond and silverware
Let ya’ll feel the glare I got to go now
I'm riding through the city with the windows rolled down
Shorty holla, so I pulled up beside her
Im fronting “Whats your name?”
She told me “boy you know me don’t play no games-
Now look they say you blowing up hey is it true, fired up?”
I say, “ Girl they wasn’t kidding like they tubes tied up”

[Hook]
I'm hollering hey, good God what a day
I gotta say it feels good to get away
Where ain't nobody stressing over shit they got to pay
Ay tell me whats work without play
All my niggas hollering hey, good God what a day
Hey baby girl tell me can you get away?
Where ain't nobody hollering bout the problems of the world
Its just me and my favorite girl, now all around they holler

[Verse 2: J Cole]
Okay so word is spreading
That I done jetted to New York- I was just up there doing my thing
So now some folks I used to know is hollering out “J. Cole!”
I got to chuckle cuz I know they used to say Jermaine
So who changed?
Whats in name though, when niggas can't hang though-your shoe strings
Your flow insane plus I got that flame throw, that Liu Kang
Even in the winter we bring, feelings of summer Suzanne
We get them hooked like T-Pain
And scoop them hoes like loose change
Can you blame me?- Im just a boy straight out the Ville
These wangsta ass niggas getting played out for real
Your acting like your trill, nigga you bet not!
You talking out your ass, you feinna get your head rocked!
This is where they shooting sideways
Boys getting blazed
Can't afford to fly so we high to get away
Now come here ladies see we trynna get you loose, pour it up
Take this juice, we gon mix it with this Goose, don’t throw it up

[Hook]
