[Intro]
Y'feel that?
That's right
Sometimes it's better just to...tell you like it is in a song

[Verse 1]
I waited long to tell you like it is
No shame in how we feel, it's the nature of this biz
We hide the way we feel, then we cover it for real
Forreal, love's a deal we conceal, then we deal
On them finer points of life together
Rainy weather was never a better reason to sever what we would celebrate
Celebrate life with her
Is she your best friend? Tell her what it's like with her
Baby, it's a blur and a whirlwind, more than a girlfriend
Girl, this is urgent, forever I was searching, but you was just perfect (perfect)
Never no more groupies on tour, I gotta keep it yours
Cause girl, you so clever and pure
That's from the souls of men who know the worth of roses on this earth
Kiss a trail down the back of your neck
Remove the shirt, put the tongue to your inner thigh
Watch you get high
I'mma underline a purse, discovering what it's worth
For us to make it work, we both gotta convert to trust to make it first
Baby, I'm a jerk but a cool one, maybe I'm a fool; run
Hop in the arms of this man full of charm
And my karma is strong, but I wanna right wrongs
So I gotta write songs...turning you on

[Hook]
So if you ever doubt that it's for real
Just know that I respect all that we've built
I know I don't tell you how I feel, but this is how I feel
And I wanna know
Baby if we gon' get through the rain
And if we gon' work for another day
I know it always ends up all the same
But let's make a change, for another day

[Verse 2]
Dedication, to you and your patience
For real, it's amazing, I need to quit playing
I could lose what I got on the fools that don't know my gov' name
Life in the fast lane, time to pump these breaks, man
Get this love straight
Be committed and fitted against my soul mate
Now that I'm whole, wait...that's a dumb route
Rolling dice for some tits and the ass out
Bounce on 'em, bounce, when I'm out, I'mma shout
I'm about my business, making it better, loving a veteran
Never concealing evidence, sending it with the settlement
Baby cause you was heaven sent
Yup, it's a lesson to you fellas, so listen, Lucky is telling you
Respect the lady holding you down, it's unforgettable
It's unforgettable, it's so incredible, it's unforgettable

[Hook]

[Bridge]
We've been talking 'bout tomorrow, and it's all the same
Now it's time to move the things that's standing in our way
We can work to keep it going for another day
Another day
(Now bring it back)

[Hook]

[Outro]
Another day (x8)
