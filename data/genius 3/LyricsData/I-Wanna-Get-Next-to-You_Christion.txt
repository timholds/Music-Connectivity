Sittin' here in this chair waitin' on you
Ah baby, to see things my way
But not a word do you say
You won't even look my way

Girl, I'm spending my dimes, wasting
My time, talking till I'm black and blue
Ah, can't you see I wanna get next to you?

Dreams of you and I go sailing by
Whenever your eyes meet mine
(You're so fine)
And girl you make me feel so insecure
You're so beautiful and pure

Why must you be unkind
(And tell me I'm not your kind, blowin' my mind)
Girl, my, my money is low and I know
That I can't take you to the fancy places

You might wanna go
Still I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you

Girl, you can bend me, shake me, make me
Whatever it takes to please you, I'm willing to do
'Cause you're my dream come true
And I wanna get next to you

I wanna get next to you
I wanna make you mine
(For all the time)
I wanna get next to you

I promise I'll never make you blue
I wanna get next to you
I wanna get next to you
