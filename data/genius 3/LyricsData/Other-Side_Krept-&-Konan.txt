[Verse 1: Konan]
I know you're gone but I wish that I could change it
I broke down when mum said you didn't make it
I hate it, that they got you but they come for me
I saw mum's heart break right in front of me
This can't be real, I'm still trying to get through it all
I'm sorry that I didn't make it to the funeral
To tell you bye even though I'll never get to
You saved my life, how could I ever forget you?
Remember that song I told you bout in the kitchen?
Paranormal, you was like that's something different
I told you the vision no one even had their verse down
You didn't even get to see how it turned out
But I ain't even stressed cause
I know you're probably up there playing Xbox
Word, this is way more than a rap to me
The other side, make sure you say hi to my dad for me

[Hook: Ari]
Raindrops are falling from the sky
Nowhere to go
Nowhere to hide
Forever dont exist
When it comes to life
Cos you never know
When its time to go
To the other side

[Verse 2: Krept]
Listen, I got to pray more
Cause when I see the angel of death
I'mma know what he came for
Me, that's it capiche
And take me to the other side with the rest of my Gs
With my grandpa, Jiggs and Uncle T
What you know about crying so much you can't breathe?
So please take this in
Cause we're all gonna decease
And not when it's too late
And your soul's tryna leave
I lost my boy Jerome last week in the gutter
Man, not another
Damn, that's my brother
Just the other week man, I see him on the strip
He said "yo Krept, you're doing it big"
Couple weeks later they put one in his wig
Fam we grew up as kids
Left my heart in bits
That feeling when someone dies
And there's nothing you can do
But pray to God you'll see them again
On the other side soon

[Hook](x2)
