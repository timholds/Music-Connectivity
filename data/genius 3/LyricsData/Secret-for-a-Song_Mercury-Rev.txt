Dawn brought a wild light, back into her tired eyes
Like violets, opening her eyelids to the light
Oh she was golden, I caught her still glowing
I told you where we're goin' girl
We're off for a dark country ride

I'll tell you a secret, I'll sell you a secret for a song
Some day I'll tell you and take you back home where you belong

All the leaves are falling, Two suns are slowly rising
I'll take you where the morning star burns just for you
My dark country bride

I'll tell you a secret, oh I'll sell you a secret for a song
I'll give you my soul, babe, an one day you'll give me yours

Oh I'll tell you a secret, I'll sell you my secret for a song
I'll give you my soul, babe, an one day you'll give me yours

I'll tell you a secret, I'll sell you my secret for a song
Some day I'll tell you and take you back home where you belong
