[Verse 1]
I was a mess when you first met me
I said I'd turn it around if you just let me
And I worked so hard cleaning up my act
You got me hooked then you threw me back

[Chorus]
I turned my life around completely
Come full circle since the day you ditched me
I'm back on the town, I'm back on the whiskey
Honey I done a complete 360

[Verse 2]
I got a drink in one hand, a phone in the other
And all my old girlfriends are running for cover
So I call my booky and I made a bet
Ya it's only first quarter and I'm back in bed

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Ya I jump off the wagon baby I didn't fall
Made a big splash like a canon ball
Lucy and the twins just walked through the door
That's a double shot of trouble I have been looking for
Ya I've been looking for you girls
I did a 180 for your affection
I went the extra mile in the wrong direction
If you want me back well you can find me at home
Ya or down at the bar just doing you wrong

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
That's right
I'm back on the town, back on the whiskey
Honey I done a complete 360

[Outro]
I quit my job, and wrecked my pickup
Going down hard and don't care if I ever get back up
