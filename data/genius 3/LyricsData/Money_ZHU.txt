[Verse 1]
Two should combine
Be true to your heart
You can believe in me

[Pre-Chorus]
So take out your gun
The things I could do
We can build from the start
Will you trust in me? (Ooh naa)

[Chorus]
Money
No, I don't need no money, no
I mean, it's just money
And it don't mean a thing without you

[Verse 2]
In the middle of the night
When the mood is right
And the moon is bright
We can give ourselves to the wild
Give it up to the wild (Oh)
When we're working from this high, and you're by my side
Look in my eyes, we can start a
Whole new life (a whole new life)

[Pre-Chorus]
So take out your gun
The things I could do
We can build from the start
Will you trust in me? (Ooh naa)

[Chorus]
Money
No, I don't need no money, no
I mean, it's just money
And it don't mean a thing without you

Money
No, I don't need no money, no
I mean, it's just money
And it don't mean a thing without you

[Bridge]
Tell me how you do it, do it
Would you, would you want some right now?
Tell me how you do it, do it
Would you, would you want some right now?
Tell me how you do it, do it
Would you, would you want some right now?
Tell me how you do it, do it
Tell me how you do it, do it

[Chorus]
Money
No, I don't need no money, no
I mean, it's just money
And it don't mean a thing without you
