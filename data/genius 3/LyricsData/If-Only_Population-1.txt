If only we loved us like before
There would be more
If only we could have stopped the war
We were losing

Love come back save the day

Promises made 'til the day we die died
Angry fists with broken wrists reply why
Four more lips that tasted truth filled lies lied
Only to return again

If only we loved us like before
There would be more
If only the scars would disappear
Verbal surgery
If only we could have seen the smoke
Simple warning
If only we loved us like before
There would be more

Love come back save the day

Someone wake me seems like lately
All i do is sleep walk
Right through the fire

If only we loved us like before
