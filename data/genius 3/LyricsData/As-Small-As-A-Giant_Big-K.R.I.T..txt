[Intro]
See I was made in my fathers image and they belittle my deeds
Their lust for convictions pledge allegiance to the almighty power and greed
See seeds born withered parents still children adolescent to their ways
Some preachers false prophets educated pigeon droppers using our sins to get paid
Slaves - give them freedom but give them dope
Take away their leader cause that give them hope
Sell them dreams of changing things like they were never kings and queens befo'
As small as a giant

[Hook]
As small as a giant, I'm still ridin'
Hand on my sword good Lord I need time
Watch for the sun-eaters blocking our shine
Enlighten my kind, reason for rhyme
I'mma find Zion, free my soul
Repent for all the things I done until my eyes closed
When the boat man come I'm paying my toll
Outside the gates of Heaven, pray to God I'm chose
As small as a giant

[Verse 1]
The beginning was kinda dark, not too soft fairly hard
Drenched with love from my mother, connected to her struggle
Till she cut me loose, now what shall I do?
It was oh so easy look at how they treat me ever since she pushed me through
Now put me back in and stop these contractions
Water breaking, aw damn I know it's bout to happen
Failed to fix, no picket fence, a dream deferred
Beer and liquor chillin' with my niggas swishas and herb
Eviction notices, hopelessness thrown on my shoulders
God won't give you more than you can handle, carry these boulders
Give it all I got until I get older
Couple medals on my sleeves cause life made me a soldier
Reminisce on how it was way back when
But some things were better off way back then
As small as a giant, a promise so divided
Probably ain't surprised in so long since we sung such over Lord's camp fires
Cosby's was cool but television is a lie
Some reason I relate to survivor
Fresh Prince but no Uncle Phil
The Carltons that I knew never stayed where we lived
Couldn't play with those kids
When they were reading books we were playing cops and crooks
When they was writing essays, I was writing hooks
Mama I'll be that nigga on TV, cause people like Bow Wow and Soulja Boy make it look easy
No Pun intended, hoping they get offended
I'm throwing up if these niggas spittin'
Didn't write it but recite it like puppets on strings
Belittled as a peasant but my bloodline is of kings
Knight in shinning armor for this rap shit, I slash quick
Far as a man spit leaving gashes on these industry bastards
They can't see what is real, don't know how I feel
They weren't raised where I live
In Mississippi

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Rise and shine, no time for sleep, thinking bout eating
Leaving this place long gone
I get no service on this earth I need to phone home
Did too much dirt to talk to God, nowadays I get the dial tone
Try again tomorrow, my heart filled with sorrow
My family broke too so why bother try trying to borrow
No car, no house, drug dealing, feeling like it might be my only option to get millions
What else could I do?
Put yourself in my shoes
If you had no whip you'd take some shortcuts too
Their ain't no time to be wasted, the world is going under
Nowadays can't tell fall from spring and winter from summer
I wonder if this was meant to be, maybe all the bullshit was meant for me, takes a lot of energy
Break these chains and erase these thangs society put up on our brain
How could I explain it, we ain't free yet
Obama cool but he ain't sending me no free checks
They killing all my niggas Lord forbid I'll be next
No now, got too many sorrows to say and
Kisses to give, they don't feel how I feel
They weren't raised where I live, Mississippi

[Hook]
