[Verse 1]
I fall down, I get up
Just a man, flesh and blood
So I pray constantly
Don't give up on me

[Verse 2]
I am weak, you are strong
I need your love to carry on
Keep the faith, hear my plea
Don't give up on me

[Chorus]
I'm just a child, there's so much I don't know
I'm doing my best to learn as I go
But I'm not afraid
As long as you holding my hand

[Verse 3]
Don't know what you love me for
You deserve so much more
I would die if you set me free
Don't give up on me

[Chorus]

[Verse4]
When my best ain't enough
When my strength won't hold up
When I'm less and i can't live
Don't give up on me

[Outro]
Keep the faith, hear my plea
Don't give up on me
Don't give up on me
