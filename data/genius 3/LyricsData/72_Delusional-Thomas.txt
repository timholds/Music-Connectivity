[Intro]
Yo, Ye-ye-yeah
Yo, Yo, yeaaaah

[Verse]
Continue to spread diseases, with my aids infested penis
Putting seeds inside of bitches, give birth to retarded fetuses
I am yet to witness success with less of a gimmick
It's either fun, happy, festive or evil anti-religious, so
I guess I'm chilling with criminals, in a world full of cowards
I see them throwing subliminals, dissing is pitiful
My condition is critical, yeah I'm dying quickly
I'm calling out for help but everybody dying with me
I find it a pity how all of my crimes been petty
Run in your house with a semi, turn your kids to confetti
Feed the scraps to the dogs
Load up the rifle then come after the blogs
All ya'll can suck my dick, you see
I'm after pussy, money, little serendipity
Yes, I'm dipping all my limbs in gold, bitch, I'm worth a fortune
Walking abortion, horrorcore, mega-morphin'
Face disfigured, yeah my thoughts are numb
Stick out like a sore thumb, not as dumb as all these people think
My mom said I need a shrinkâ€”
But fuck everything you stand fo
I ain't gotta be humble I'm the man ho
I've been getting into trouble like hopping in a car
Saw you walking out the store like "Where'd my van go?"
And now my show's too good to get canceled
You a pussy, all distressed, like a damsel
Bet your brother handsome, these evil eyes were hazel
Hang him by his ankles, sit back and watch him dangle
Space boots, sipping straight goose, obliterated warfare
Catastrophic bombs, I'm giving acid to my moms
Hack into the government, computer system fill the world
With superstition, cruel intentions, welcome to a new religion
Open up your mouth and then I'm pooping in it
I lose endorsements cause I'm too sadistic
But, super-prolific, fuck her and her friends they hit me
Tell me that their cootchie itches
My dick is booty scented
