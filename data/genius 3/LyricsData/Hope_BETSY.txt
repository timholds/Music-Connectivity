[Verse 1]
When I’m falling through the fire
And my feet burn on the ground
When I’m drowning in the ocean
And my screams don’t make a sound
When my tears no longer soothe me
And my soul no longer smiles
When my heart it needs the shelter
And my face can tell no lies

[Chorus]
Won’t you give me hope, hope
And hold me patiently
Won’t you give me hope, hope
And sweet sympathy
Won’t you give me hope, hope
And stay close to me
Won’t you give me hope, hope
Unconditionally

[Verse 2]
Tomorrow I’ll be fighting
Today I’m on my knees
I’m running from the lightning
No wood for all the leaves
When I find my way back home
And I leave behind the smoke
When my mind it starts to roam
I’ve broken from the rope

[Bridge]
Don’t judge my weakness
Just give me cover
Cos I’m so low
So low

[Chorus]
Won’t you give me hope, hope
And hold me patiently
Won’t you give me hope, hope
And sweet sympathy
Won’t you give me hope, hope
Won’t you stay close to me
Won’t you give me hope, hope
Unconditionally
