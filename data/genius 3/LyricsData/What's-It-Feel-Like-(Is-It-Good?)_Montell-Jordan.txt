(Intro)
Yo, Def Soul
Montell, M3
Yo, it ain't over
It just begun

Let me know how it feels when I'm inside of you
Everytime I hear you say my name, scream and moan
I know we're getting closer to

1 - The moment that we
Can't stop 'cause it's getting too hot
The freaky things you say to me
Show me you like it, tell me

2 - What's it feel like when I'm sexin' you
Tell me baby
When I'm inside, is it good to you

Now when I'm touching you, tasting you
And doing all the things you like
I'll drop down and I'll kiss your thighs
And satisfy
Take your body there tonight, oh girl

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Repeat 2

Is it good

Good to you
Let me know
Is it good
Is it good

Is it good (It's so good to me)
Good to you (It's so good to me)
Let me know (And I'll tell you what it feels like)
Is it good
Is it good

Repeat 2
Repeat 2
Repeat 2

Repeat 2 while:
See, all the women in the world
All at one time
If you could hear
If you could hear what you
What your kitty's sayin' right now
If you can hear what ever woman's kitty's sayin' right now
That's what it would sound like
You'd hear it all over the world
You'd hear 'em say
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
