[Verse 3: Black Thought]
You keep playin games with me that's not coasta
Instead of blessin me now like you supposed ta
You take me aboard love roller coasta
Trying to get off when your on like Oprah girl
That's a negative
Like a pessimist
You say it ain't love
I say yes it is
Well I'm guessing this
The big question is
Why you sending me all these mixed messages
