[Intro: Sampled]

[Verse 1: Belly]
Screamin' 'til we overdose
I almost did the other day
You can't handle what you're seein'
Baby, you should look away
I was laying in the kitchen
Shit, I didn't even pray
Smile all on my face
This the shit that I embrace
Boy, I blow a quarter million
Got it just the other day
So addicted to prescriptions
And these dirty concentrates
I been poppin', I been sippin'
I been smokin' all day
Half a trip away, I'm a doctors slip away

[Hook: Belly]
Why you feel so different to me
Something feels so different to me
(You know, you know)
Maybe you’re just trippin' like me (I know, I know)
Honestly I can't feel a thing (you know, you know, you know)
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me

[Verse 2: Belly]
So the story goes, baby
Bitches come and go
You don't even love me when the batch is runnin' low
Nevermind, you were never mine, that's a lie
Money made you blind
I can see it in your eyes
Getting high every 45 minutes
Man it's somethin' else
Pop a couple Adderall
Wash it down with percocet
Think I need some padded walls
Leaning just in case I fall
Only cheap liquor left
Smell like rubbin' alcohol

[Hook: Belly]
Why you feel so different to me?
Different to me
Something feels so different to me
(You know, you know)
Maybe you’re just trippin' like me (I know, I know)
Honestly I can't feel a thing (you know, you know, you know)
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
Different to me
