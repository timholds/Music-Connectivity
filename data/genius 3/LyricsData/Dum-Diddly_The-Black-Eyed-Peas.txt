You know the music make you jump and prance
The B-E-Peas we keep you rocking on the dance
You know my music make 'em jump and prance
Dum diddly dum dum diddly dum dum diddly dum dum diddly diddly

You know the music make me jump and prance
The B-E-Peas we keep you rocking on the dance
Uh-us uh-us jump and prance
Dum diddly dum dum diddley dum dum diddly dum dum diddly diddly

Bring on the rhythm; bring on the drums
The rim shot sound like someone gunned
(Pop! Pop!) There go your ear drums
So raise the volume to the maximum
Base booming bout to make your body feel numb
Pulsations probably penetrate your skeleton
This little diddley definitely demonstrates some
Dum diddley dum - so dance to the drum

Don't hurt yourself, take it easy
There's no better time than right now
So let yourself go, o-eh-o
Watch yourself now, here comes the sound

Freeze
Music please
Apparently we the true MC's
B-E Boys no decoys you know the sting
B-E-Peas till infinity
And we officially also fresh in the scene
So tell me if you see a crew that officially
Hit the whole globe simultaneously
Hit after hit, check out my melody

Don't hurt yourself, take it easy
There's no better time than right now
So let yourself go, o-eh-o
Watch yourself now, here comes the sound

Ooo Bing-They be back ayo!

Sim sim sim, blum blum blum
The Black Eyed Peas begun with action
Repeating rhy-rhythm in satisfaction
No need for asking, that's what's happening
The blip blip blip, the blah blah blau
You didn't know me then and you'll never know me now
I'm the Apl.De.Ap, the Filipino Ap
If you need to know my style, yeah let me show you how

Don't hurt yourself, take it easy
There's no better time than right now
So let yourself go, o-eh-o
Watch yourself now, here comes the sound
