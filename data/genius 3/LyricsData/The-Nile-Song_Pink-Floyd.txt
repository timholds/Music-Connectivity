[Verse 1]
I was standing by the Nile
When I saw the lady smile
I would take her out for a while
For a while

[Verse 2]
My tears wept like a child
How her golden hair was blowing wild
Then she spread her wings to fly
For to fly

[Verse 3]
Soaring high above the breezes
Going always where she pleases
She will make it to the islands in the sun

[Verse 4]
I will follow in her shadow
As I watch her from my window
One day I will catch her eye

[Verse 5]
She is calling from the deep
Summoning my soul to endless sleep
She is bound to drag me down
Drag me down
