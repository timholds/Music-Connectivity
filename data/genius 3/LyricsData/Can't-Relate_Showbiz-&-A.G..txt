[Verse 1: A.G.]
(Yeah)
Hustlers, dealers, pushers, squealers
Producers, rappers, users, clappers
Used to the madness, shooting for the practice
Like it on camera, so she call herself a actress (tsh)
Ask Dr. Phil if I'm not for real
Say I'm militant cause I feel like Elijah feel
And we ride for real, walk like a panther
No relation to James Todd, my name God
She like to strip, she call herself a dancer
I like to spit, I'm known to write the anthems
You a banter, I'm like Samson
Rap's elite tandem from Camden to Hampton
You don't know about the Bronx? Then you camping
Sleeping, lunching, my style is drunken
Scary ass nigga they should call you pumpkin
I can't relate when you working with Jake
Come on

[Chorus]
Get back, buy the dick, start talking to deez
I can't relate 'cause it never happened to me
Catch beef on the streets and you copping a plea
I can't relate 'cause it never happened to me
Meet a chick that's a dime, got you spending them G's
I can't relate 'cause it never happened to me
You want a show with no dough trying to get it for free?
We can't relate 'cause it never happened to me

[Verse 2: A.G.]
Winners, losers, sinners, shooters
Robbers, coppers, sparrin' with the choppers
Motherless child, brotherless now
Was killed on the street, left him wondering how?
Right through the windshield, slugs through the glove
Caught shots in the body, caught shots in his mug
Who needs weed when life is at full speed?
I'm so high it feels like I won't die
No dope or crack could match the rush (nope)
Cause I'm high off life, wanna ride all night
My Life's so dope, catch me leaning and nodding
But they got the babies fiending and starving
And I'm known for my amazing quotes
But I'm raised with folks, that kill instant like Quaker Oats
Intoxication, on these blocks are Satan
In the Mott Haven section, infection

[Chorus]
Get back, buy the dick, start talking to deez
I can't relate 'cause it never happened to me
Catch beef on the streets and you copping a plea
I can't relate 'cause it never happened to me
Meet a chick that's a dime, got you spending them G's
I can't relate 'cause it never happened to me
You want a show with no dough trying to get it for free?
We can't relate 'cause it never happened to me
