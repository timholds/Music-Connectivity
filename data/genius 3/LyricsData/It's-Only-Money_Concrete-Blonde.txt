You don't believe in love
You don't believe in hatred
Put your money in the bank
That's the only way to save it

You try to make a buck
But you haven't got a penny
And you need a little love
But you know you won't get any

You don't believe in God
You don't believe in glory
Got a brother in the penny
Tells the same kind of story

If I had another life
I bet you would be waiting
If I had another soul
You would have sold it all to Satan

I'm rung out dry
I'm rung out dry
It's only money

You don't believe in God
You don't believe in Jesus
Got a sister in New York
You know how she pleases

Walking the streets
On the south side of the city
Trying to make ends meet now
Isn't it a pity... for money

I'm rung out dry
I'm rung out dry
