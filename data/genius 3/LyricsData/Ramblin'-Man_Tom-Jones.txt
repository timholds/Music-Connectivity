[Chorus]
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Tryin' to make a livin' and doin' the best I can
And when it's time for leavin', I hope you'll understand
That I was born a ramblin' man

Well, my father was a gambler down in Georgia
And he wound up on the wrong end of a gun
And I was born in the back seat of a Greyhound bus
Rollin' down Highway 41

[Chorus]
All right

I'm on my way to New Orleans this mornin'
Leavin' out of Nashville, Tennessee
They're always havin' a good time down on the Bayou
Lord, them Delta women think the world of me

[Chorus]
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
Lord, I was born a ramblin' man
