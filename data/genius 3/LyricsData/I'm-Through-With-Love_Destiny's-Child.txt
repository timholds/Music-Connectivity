I gave my heart to you
I gave up my friends like you said I should do
Put aside my smile for you
Threw out my dreams if you said you didn't approve
I gave my mind, compromise my life just to see I'd find
You were trying hold me back slowly throwing me off of my track
Disappointed again

I'm through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm finally giving it up
I've given so much in the past for a love I never had
I'm through with it
I'm, I'm through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm finally giving it up

Oh, there you go, comparing me
To every little model on the T-V screen
Oh there you go, complaining to me, cause I wanna spend time with my family
My esteem has gone down
You never wanna take me out
You make me feel dumb, and alone
I don't know where to go
I'm through with it

I'm through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm finally giving it up
I've given so much in the past for a love I never had
I'm through with it
I'm, I'm through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm finally giving it up

I shared all my secrets with you
Even when it hurt I told the truth
I Paralyze my growth for you
I gave you control felt so helpless without you
Couldn't be a friend
To anyone happy
Cause with you I see
Misery loves company
I don't know if this is love
Cause if it's love
I don't want it anymore
I'm through with it

I'm through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm finally giving it up
I've given so much in the past for a love I never had
I'm through with it
I'm, I'm through with it, love
I'm through with it, through with it, love
I'm finally giving it up

Why do I feel so empty?
I'm crying out for some stability
Destroy my many insecurities
I'm breaking down somebody pray for me
Need a love like no other not an ordinary love
Restore my joy, wisdom and courage
Lord I need your love
I found a new love, I found new, found a new love
I finally found it in God

I found a new love
I found a new, found a new love
I found a new, found a new love
I found a new, found a new love
I finally found it in God
I've given so much in the past, for a love I've always had
I've found a new
I, I, found a new love
I found a new, found a new love
I finally found it in God!
