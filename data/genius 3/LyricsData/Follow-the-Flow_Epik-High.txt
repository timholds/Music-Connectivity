[MYK]
It's right here Epik High you might hear
There's a new voice behind the promo for this year
And you like it all of a sudden and don't know why emcee MYK
Making you wanna buy, so high, that I'm hypnotizing the public
When this shit drops they're really not ready to catch the subject
Off topic still I kill this mic before I drop it drop the beats
On time making customers wanna cop it, stop it It's too much
We're gonna sell out, I thought you knew it's Epik High
Do I have to spell it out? well I just did flipped your lid and gave
Your brain a kiss now you're stuck cuz tablo and MYK made'em pissed
We write rhymes on a regular take tracks to the face, turning
Silence into music or the day goes to waste
We travel on into unknown don't follow the roadsign
We just try to form the rhymes that read yo mind!

Let's go everybody follow the flow
It's Like one to the two two three here we go
Let's go everybody gettin' to know
It's like check where you're at and ask Yourself where did it go?
Let's go everybody follow the flow
It's Like one to the two two three here we go
Let's go everybody gettin' to know
It's like check where you're at and ask Yourself where did it go?

Contaminators can't evade us, epik rhyme animators
Tailor-made ta git you high like skyscraper elevators
We skywalkin', leavin' sly talkin' player haters
Microphone masturbators breathin' hard like darth vaders
Fuckin' fakers, better recognize, I'm an
Originator, fed up with your lies, since I
Blew up, turned the tables, got famous
Ya quick to switch sides like turntable faders
Now... I do love all of God's creations
But like an empty hospital, I'm out of patience
Yes I am... the rap game's voice
Every cat's main choice, the rap James Joyce
It's a piece of cake, gimme a break
I kill MCs, then speak at they finnegan's wake
I'm much mo' than a cheap CD
I'm a prohibition mc - I speak-easy
[D-Tox]
You betta recognize like u lookin' in the mirror
I'm takin' lives like a serial killer
For reala spit fire like Godzilla
Supplyin' dope lines like a mo'fuckin coke dealer
The rap pharoah from ground zero
Stab u in the chest wit a broken arrow
U speakin' loud but the crowd is sleepin' hollow
Why u speakin' proud when no headz would ever follow
Kill u for dolo, cd to phono
Not a fan of U2 but I do it pro-bono
Oh no, this is D-tox from the bay
Put it down for Epik High let em walk u the way
