[Hook:]
I told her you should go home
It's better that way
I wish I could come with you
But I got to stay, but I got to stay

[Verse 1:]
All aboard I heard them call your name
I knew you got your ticket now you're on your way
And it was hard to watch you wave goodbye
I write you here and there with no need to reply
It's just I lost a good friend in a time of need
Like forever would be better but this time your free
Hate you left us kind of selfish just to think that way
You going home don't worry what you probably would say
But yeah it hurts I smile at the thought of
You At peace in your mind, no longer ache in your heart
Finish and start, rise with the sun
Finally hear your father say servant well done
I strive to be half of what you was
I'm just hoping that I can carry on your love
And I regret all the times I had to leave you
I promise I'mma see you when I see you

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Your motherly hands used to usher Sunday mornings
Played the tambourine so well
Reminiscing on my granddaddy, shed tears as you looked at his pictures on the shelf
Phone ringing everyday, friends gone away
Wishing you could go, but you had to stay
I sit and cried with you
Soon the fellings of the past aware, one day that you pack your bags
Turn to me and ask don't fret when I leave
This earthly body of mine done did all of its deeds
Crawled till it walked and held all it could breathe
Carry on what I taught you was given thru he
To you from me, in times like this believe
I got a call like you used to get just the other day, they told me you'd gone home to stay

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]
Now I know what you meant when you used to say
If I had wings, wings, wings
I'd fly away, I'd fly away
Lord, if I had wings, wings, wings
I'd fly away,I'd fly away

[Hook:]
