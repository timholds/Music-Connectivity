I'm gonna get my bathing suit on
Gonna get my base face on
Gonna get my hat out of loan
Gonna get my space face on

I'm gonna turn all snakes into bone
Go wishing the stone
Keep the crystal cat cold
Gotta get the throne

Hope my baby
May we meet a beastman
Hold us there
Happy but by one hand

Gonna get my pile of stone
Gonna my loud loud gong
Gonna get my men into rows
You better cover dem toes

Big carrot throne
Let them take a load
The crystal cat gets cold
