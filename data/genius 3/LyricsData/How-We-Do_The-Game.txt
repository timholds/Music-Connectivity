[Hook: 50 Cent]
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it, so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it, so show us some love

[Verse 1: The Game]
Fresh, like, unh; Impala, unh
Chrome hydraulics, 808, drums
You don't want none, nigga better run
When beef is on, I'll pop that trunk
Come get some, pistol grip, pump
If a nigga step on my white Air Ones
It's redrum; ready, here I come
Compton, unh, Dre found me in the slums
Sellin' that skunk, one hand on my gun
I was sellin' rocks when Master P was sayin' "Uhhhh"
Buck pass the blunt
These G-Unit girls just wanna have fun
Coke and rum, got weed on the ton
I'm bangin' with my hand up her dress, like, unh
I'll make her cum, purple haze in my lungs
Whole gang in the front, in case a nigga wanna stunt

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I put Lamborghini doors on that Es-clade
Low pro, so look like I'm ridin' on blades
In one year, mane, a nigga's so paid
I have a straight bitch in the telly goin' both ways (Ah!)
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best
Tre pound on my hip, teflon on my chest
They say I'm no good, ‘cause I'm so hood
Rich folks do not want me around
‘Cause shit might pop off, and if shit pop off
Somebody gon' get laid the fuck out
They call me new money, say I have no class
I'm from the bottom, I came up too fast
The hell if I care, I'm just here to get my cash
Bougie-ass bitches, you can kiss my ass!

[Hook: 50 Cent]
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it, so show us some love
This is how we do
We make a move and act a fool while we up in the club
This is how we do
Nobody do it like we do it, so show us some love

[Verse 3: The Game]
I put gold Daytonas on that cherry six-fo'
White walls so clean it's like I'm ridin' on Vogues
Hit one switch, mane, that ass so low
Cali got niggas in New York ridin' on hundred spokes
Touch me, tease me, kiss me, please me
I give it to you just how you like it, girl
You know I'm rockin' with the best
Four pound on my hip, gold chain on my chest (Ah!)

[Verse 4: 50 Cent]
50, uhh, Bentley, uhh
Em came and got a nigga fresh out the slum
Automatic gun, fuck 'em one-on-one
We wrap up your punk ass, stunt and you done
Homie, it's Game time

[Verse 5: The Game]
You ready? Here I come
Call Lloyd Banks and get this motherfucker crunk
It took two months, but 50 got it done
Signed with G-Unit, had niggas like, "Huh?"
Don't try to front, I'll leave your ass slumped
Thinkin' I'm a punk, get your fuckin' head lumped
50 got a gun

[Verse 6: 50 Cent]
Ready? Here he come
Got a sick vendetta, to get this cheddar
Meet my Beretta, the drama, setter
Sip Amaretta, my flow sounds better
Than average, on tracks I'm a savage, I damage
Any nigga tryin' to front on my clique (G-Unit!)
