(Slim)
How could you
Just hurt me
And leave me
(Leave me all alone)
How could you destroy my life
How could you throw it all away
What made you
Dessert me and deceived me
Why did you just let me down
How could you throw it all away
How could you throw

(Chorus)
How could you throw it all away
Throw it all away
When I gave my all, baby
How could you throw it all away
And I gave my all
How could you throw
How could you throw it all away
Throw it all away
You destroyed my life, baby
How could you throw it all way

(Slim)
How could you
Just lead me
Into thinking
(Thinking you would be there)
How could you destroy my heart
How could you throw it all away
I love you
Believe you
And I trusted you
(Put all my trust in you)
How could you just let me down
How could you throw it all way
How could you throw

(Chorus)
How could you throw it all away
Girl how could you
Throw it all away
How could you just take it all
How could you throw it all away
Oh how could you throw
How could you throw it all away
Throw it all
Throw it all away
When I gave my love
How could you throw it all away

(Bridge - Slim)
I love you girl
You love me so
Where did we go wrong
I know that I
Gave my all to you
But somehow that wasn't good enough
How could you throw it away

Chorus until Fade with Slim adlibs
