Yeah, Showa Eski

[Verse 1]
Most of them wait for the drop
Not me I'm in straight from the top
Wiley the Showa Eski them
Names are gone ring the bells and then off
I don't need syrup, I ain't got a cough
Wanna box, got eight in the loft
I should be on the TV much more
I know I got a face, what's what
It's a must to elevate and take that shot
If I score then I'm gonna be at the top spot
My flow, top notch
My lyrics, top notch
Might see me and I ain't got a watch
And I don't fear no one, I ain't gotta watch
Watch what? Test who?
I ain't part of a bulletproof vest crew
Cause I walk with God, die when my time's up
Single file everybody, line up
Turn a new page, get righteous
I'm giveing out Zip Files like a virus
I wanna thank them fans
That knew I had very good plans
Had tons of music album ready
But the label they didn't understand
I'm on another label, gave me control
I play it like a game in a console
I'm talented, how could you not know
I got a super kryptonite flow
But back to the bars that I wanna hear
Playing at the back of the car
We already know that's not for the chart
But it's what I done back at the start
And I still flow smart

[Chorus]
It's Wiley, Showa Eski
And none of them boy can test me
It's Wiley, nobody left me
Cause im out with the best yeah I told them
It's Wiley, Showa Eski
And none of them boy can test me
It's Wiley, nobody left me
Cause im out with the best yeah I told them

[Verse 2]
Take a cheap shot, stop playing now
That's what kids do
But you got the whole scene here with you
I'm at the front of the army
You're a pig in the game, salami
These people tried to argue with me all the time
Don't send me bar me
You got a problem, view your opinion
Might a be a hater, check all the symptoms
If I'm getting better in the game
Them man are slacking, why the hell should I bring them?
It's my kingdom, what are you thinkin'
Link a lot of girls so that's what I'm thinkin'
Run up on the stage drop one hook
Where's My Brother get a reload, that's what I'm thinking'
I'm the in thing, ask anyone who
Is in tune to the music I do
Give me a distinction, I raise the level up
High, believe me even you don't want to
I move ghost like Hollow [?] and Dimples
Keepin' it plain and simple
For the urban scene, I'm a symbol
Prove you can do it, money, jingle
Paper - chasing, in a a car racing
One of them big boys sets with the bass in
In a meeting bring the briefcase in
Full of dough like Puffy and Mase and
A little while back when Bad Boy ruled
Thirty-one years I've already been schooled
I didn't wanna end up in beef but my name's already been called


[Chorus]
It's Wiley, Showa Eski
And none of them boy can test me
It's Wiley, nobody left me
Cause im out with the best yeah I told them
It's Wiley, Showa Eski
And none of them boy can test me
It's Wiley, nobody left me
Cause im out with the best yeah I told them

[Verse 3]
But back to the bars that I like
Radio rinse FM on a Sunday
People listen to KISS on a Monday
Radio One every day not one day
One day I wanna strike like lightning
With a couple of hits that are frightening

--- part missing
Im a odd watch
????
------

From - no ends could you bare me
Can't make me bread like a sarnie
Cause I'm out in the club
With the gyaldem looking punani
Go to the straight to the zoo or the Bamboo Club
In my new garms and Armani
I'm a cool guy, R1, R6
Won't see man wingin' on a Harley
But you will see man in Trench Town
Puffing on the high grade, visit the yard of Bob Marley
Old Volkswagen, all empty
Tell them the Father God sent me
I went from a Uno to a Bentley
I'm a hustler, haters resent me
I tell the soundboy, please don't tempt me
Your lyrical mind is empty

[Chorus]
It's Wiley, Showa Eski
And none of them boy can test me
It's Wiley, nobody left me
Cause im out with the best yeah I told them
It's Wiley, Showa Eski
And none of them boy can test me
It's Wiley, nobody left me
Cause im out with the best yeah I told them
