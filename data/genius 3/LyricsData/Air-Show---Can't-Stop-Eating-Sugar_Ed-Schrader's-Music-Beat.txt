[Air Show:]
In the ceiling fan
Those troubled times
Is quite okay

In the ceiling fan
No trouble man
I'm quite okay

Air show, drive me crazy
Drive me crazy
It's amazing

Air show, drive me crazy
Drive me crazy
You amaze me

I'm the ceiling fan
A troubled man
A hazy dew

Reincarnate plans
To shuffled white
And piling flames

Air show, drive me crazy
Drive me crazy
It's amazing

Air show, drive me crazy
Drive me crazy
You amaze me

[Can't Stop Eating Sugar:]
I can't stop eating sugar
I can't stop eating sugar

See what it does
Feel what it does
But it's always in my face
And it's always been my cause

Tyrannosaurus Rex
And his goddamn claws

I can't stop eating sugar
I can't stop eating sugar
I can't stop eating sugar
I can't stop eating sugar

When you can't stop doing something
Brother, you must stop yourself
When you can't stop doing something
Brother, you must stop yourself

There's a boxing match
Across the ocean
Swing it till I hit Portugal
But there's coral on my feet
So I can't move
Stingrays hitting me
I can't feel

I can't stop eating sugar
I can't stop eating sugar
I can't stop eating sugar
I can't stop eating sugar
