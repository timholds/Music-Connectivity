Tell me who's gonna look at you
And love you for the person you are
Tell me who's gonna understand
That sometimes you can take things too far
Tell me who's gonna be there when
Times are good and when they are bad
Tell me who's gonna love you girl
The way I loved you

Tell me who's gonna be right there
To wipe your tears whenever you cry
Tell me who's gonna talk it out
To make sure everything is alright
Tell me who's gonna call you on the telephone
When you're all alone
Tell me who's gonna love you girl

[Chorus:]
Ain't nobody gonna do the things I did
Ain't nobody gonna kiss the way I kiss
Ain't nobody gonna spend the way I spend
Ain't nobody gonna love you like I did
Ain't nobody gonna be the fool for you
Ain't nobody gonna open the doors for you
Ain't nobody going through what I went through
Ain't nobody gonna love you
Love you like I did...

Anytime you needed a friend
Girl I was right there for you
Anytime you needed love
You could call on me for that too
There is nothing, nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Tell me whos gonna love you girl
The way I loved you

Everything you always wanted
Girl you know I gave it to you
Never had to worry cuz you knew
I would take care of you
And you may find, another man
But can't nobody love you
The way that I loved you

[Chorus]

How could you do it?
Baby, how could you (you did me wrong)
Treat me the way you did (you broke my heart)
And how could you leave me?
When you know I did (leave me by myself)
I did everything for you (girl, I did everything for you)
And you'll never find another man to love you the way that I did
Girl nobody... nobody...
Will love you just like me...

[Chorus until end]
