[Intro]

Shut up
Oiii Scorcher, you should be in a straitjacket ya'kna
You're a madman, this beat's crazy
Oiiii, nahhh
Oi I'm back don't ya know
Do something
Yeah I've been away, shut uppp
Bracka, bracka, bracka
Ladies & gentleman
Look

[Verse 1]

I don't care what Borough you're from
I look at boys, they playing bad man like who they tryna Acton
Town if you floss, mans evnvy will Turnham Green
Make 'em snatch at your New Cross
Blood my bits are gritty, ki's of work and no jobs uh
Guess in two ways its a White City
Staying on tracks a battle, fam I need an Angel
I pray to god on my knee's in a White Chapel
Lifes stressful, lucky I'm Westbourne
A (??) in my heart, now I got a chest full
Plus I'm living on the edge, road niggas are known for years
They'll push a ting to your Temple
It's drugs, sex, whips, action
Man will Clapham, North West is where it happens
Out my hood there's usually three ways
Music, sports or drugs not everyone can live the Queensway
Most heads are tryna get out of the estate
Or out of my hood and that be everyone's dream mate
And hustlers we move quick shit
Cause the Metropolitan police circle our District

[Hook]

I'm from London, Underground where t'ugs are found
You know there's, drugs in pounds and slugs and rounds
London, Underground where t'ugs are found
You know there's, sluts around they'll fuck for pounds


[Verse 2]

Pink notes with the Queens head, me and my boys need them
Girls think I'm a rich man, get on your Neasden
And who cares if your brothers on it
And you're the youngest of his Seven Sisters, you'll still get pressed on road
These days these girls are on Wapping
Fuck bare man, so allow no condoming
Protect what's in your jeans, they'll leave you with a Burnt Oak
And by that I mean leave your Wood Green
I don't kiss 'em, I just Peckham
It's not just girls washing your brain, the government's doing the same
I pray to God every night, please lord send me the Shepards
Bush and Blair keep blowing up the trains
They're tryna get us shook of Muslims
That's ridiculous, the only thing I'm shook ofs when I see unattended parcels
I wish savoury never happened
I'd be in Africa, with my queen, kids, Elephant & Castle

[Spoken - Masterstepz]

Did you get all of the Underground stations?
If you not, you need to go back and listen to it again!
