[Verse 1: Rachel Goswell]
Put it all behind you
Put it in a song, yeah
I don't want to know about it
Put it in a corner
Somewhere I can't find it
I don't want to think about

Put it on a fire
Put it in a pocket
I don't want to see you now
Put it in a picture
Hide it in a story
I don't wanna know about

[Verse 2: Neil Halstead]
I don't remember much about it all
Just saw you loving someone else
And swallowing that bitter pill
My shabby heart was acting out
You know I don't want no one else

[Verse 3: Rachel Goswell]
Put it all behind you
Put it in a song, yeah
I don't want to know about it
Put it in a corner
Somewhere I can't find it
I don't want to think about

Put it on a fire
Put it in a pocket
I don't want to see you now
Put it in a picture
Hide it in a story
I don't wanna know about

[Chrous]
???

[Outro: Rachel Goswell]
Threw it all upon a fire
Took the fight to someone else
