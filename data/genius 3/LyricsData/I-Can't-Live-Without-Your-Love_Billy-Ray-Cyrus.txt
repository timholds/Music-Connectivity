[Verse 1]
I walk around like a nervous wreck
I'm a fool, but what the heck
I'm standing here up to my neck in desire
I wanna call, want you to know
What I'm feeling in my soul
Girl, I tried, but I can't control this fire

[Chorus]
It's killing me
You're all I see
One life is not enough
You're all I need, the air I breathe
I can't live without your love

[Verse 2]
I've been searching all my life
Just to feel this way inside
Now that I do I just can't hide no more
The touch, the feel of your skin
Makes me feel alive again
And it shakes me to the core

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I just wanna hold you
For the rest of my life
You're all I need, the air I breathe
I can't live without your love
Can't live without your love

[Verse 4]
I walk around like a nervous wreck
I'm a fool, but what the heck
I can't live without your love
I want to call, want you to know
What I'm feeling in my soul
I can't live without your love
