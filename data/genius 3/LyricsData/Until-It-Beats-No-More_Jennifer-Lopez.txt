[Verse 1]
I was down for the count
Feeling like I've come to the end
Nothing really mattered
Nothing left for me to mend
Ooh, but then you came, and I still couldn't see
Till you tore down every wall in me
How you healed me with your patience
If it's all I ever do, I'll never stop loving you

[Chorus]
Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe
And there is no doubt about it, there no doubt about it
I'm in love, and it's all because of you
I was fading, but you pulled me through
Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die
And there is no doubt about it, it's love, and I have found it
Feel the beat again, stronger than before
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more

[Verse 2]
Was in place full of pain
With a broken down heart in despair
He took away my feelings
And made it hard for me to care
Ooh, but then you crashed through the door, to my soul
Put back all the pieces and made me whole
I was living in the past, oh no
Now I'm never looking back, I'm never looking back

[Chorus]
Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe
And there is no doubt about it, there no doubt about it
I'm in love, and it's all because of you
I was fading, but you pulled me through
Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die
And there is no doubt about it, it's love, and I have found it
Feel the beat again, stronger than before
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more...

[Bridge]
Whatever you want me to
I'm gonna see you through
All I ever do
Never stop loving you...

[Chorus (ad-libs)]
Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe (Hey yay!)
And there is no doubt about it (I'm in love), there no doubt about it
I'm in love, and it's all because of you
I was fading, but you pulled me through (fading but you pulled me through)
Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt (I was hurt), thought I'd die (hey yay!)
And there is no doubt about it, there's just no doubt (I'm much stronger)
Feel the beat again, stronger than before (so much stronger than before)
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more
