[Hook - will.i.am]
Someday, I'm gonna get it right, my life
Someday, I'm gonna figure it out, maybe tonight
Cause I know, Imma get, it right
And I knoww, Imma get, it right
Someday (ohh-oh-oh-OHH-oh, ohh-oh-oh-OHH-oh)
One day (ohh-oh-oh-OHH-oh, ohh-oh-oh-OHH-oh)
Someday (ohh-oh-oh-OHH-oh, ohh-oh-oh-OHH-oh)
One day (ohh-oh-oh-OHH-oh, ohh-oh-oh-OHH-oh)

[Verse 1 - will.i.am]
I'm 'bout to get it 'bout to get-get-get it
Can't do with little cause I'm big-big Willie
I'm 'bout to do it just like Bill Gates did it
Cause I was born... I was born to kill it
Gimme my dollars gi-gimme my dollars
I need it bigger I'm too big for smaller
I keep on working like I'm blue collar
I'm 'bout to get it baby, In Shallah

[Hook - will.i.am]
Someday, I'm gonna get it right, my life
Someday, I'm gonna figure it out, maybe tonight
Cause I know, Imma get, it right
And I knoww, Imma get, it right
Someday (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
One day (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
Someday (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
One day (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh)

[Bridge - will.i.am]
Breathe.. just breathe..
Now breathe.... drop it

[Verse 2 - apl.de.ap]
I came here from the Philippines
In the plane with some big big dreams
I left everything I knew behind me
Like my mom and my family
People tell me that I ain't gonna make it
I got a finger aimed at all of them haters
In a minute you're gon' catch the vapors
Cause in a minute Imma get my paper

[Hook - will.i.am]
Someday, I'm gonna get it right, my life
Someday, I'm gonna figure it out, maybe tonight
Cause I know, Imma get, it right
And I knoww, Imma get, it right
Someday (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
One day (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
Someday (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh)
One day (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh oh-oh)

[Verse 3 - Taboo]
Someday you're wondering
If you're really gonna make it (aw yeah)
And sometimes you wanna know
Is there anyone to save you (aw yeah)
I know you've been down before
Like underneath the ground (under the ground)
Still got another chance
To turn it all around (turn it around)
Just know your time will come
Go give it all you got (give it all you got)
Don't stop believing
So give it all you got (give it all you)
