[Verse 1]
Are you going to call it quits
Because girl from where I sit
All the signs I read
Say you're over me
My world stopped
And time stands still
Until I know
I know how you feel

[Chorus]
Are you all out of love

[Verse 2]
The story in your eyes
Tells me the well's run dry
Am I a fool for holding on
For praying this feeling's wrong
If what I fear
Is really true
Then girl
I want to hear it from you

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
Is this the end of the line
Is this as far as we go
Or can I somehow change your mind
Or will your heart be forever closed

[Chorus]
