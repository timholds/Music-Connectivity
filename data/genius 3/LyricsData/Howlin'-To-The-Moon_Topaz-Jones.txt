[Verse 1]
Shadows twist in the night
Oh, what a life
I guess you gotta
Roll with the dice
I bet your bottom dollar
And my soul with a price
I watch your skin glow
As I drove through the light
Close, but we alright
I need another dosa
'Cause this like mimosas
Couple wolves in the middle of
A winter solstice, but

[Chorus]
You bring out the animal in me
Got me sending messages
To my family shouldn't see
Every time I'm in it I'm like
"Damn, this shit is sweet,"
I think you the type of meat
That a cannibal would eat

But I would never damage your physique
I'd have to pay the fees for lawyers
And the damages you'd seek
Couldn't stand to see you weep
But I love it when you scream
It's a fantasy we keep
Under covers where you dream

[Hook]
Howling to the moon, ooo-ooo-oooh
Howling to the moon, calling out for you
Howling to the moon (I'm howling), ooo-ooo-oooh
Howling to the moon, calling out for you

[Verse 2]
I gotta have it, such a trip (oh, oh, baby)
I gotta have it (you just might be it)
Intoxicated (intoxicated), sweet perfume
Last night I had you howling at the moon

[Chorus]
You bring out the animal in me
Got me sending messages
To my family you shouldn't see
Every time I'm in it I'm like
"Damn, this shit is sweet,"
I think you the type of meat
That a cannibal would eat
But I don't want to handle the deceit
Leave it all under the rug
For the janitor to sweep
Couldn't stand to see you weep
But I love it when you scream
It's a fantasy we keep
Under covers where you dream

[Hook]
Howling to the moon (I'm howling), ooo-ooo-oooh
Howling to the moon, calling out for you
Howling to the moon (I'm howling), ooo-ooo-oooh
Howling to the moon, calling out for you

[Hook]
Howling to the moon, ooo-ooo-oooh
Howling to the moon, calling out for you
Howling to the moon, ooo-ooo-oooh
Howling to the moon, calling out for you

[Bridge]

[Hook]
Howling to the moon, ooo-ooo-oooh
Howling to the moon, calling out for you
Howling to the moon, ooo-ooo-oooh
Howling to the moon, calling out for you
