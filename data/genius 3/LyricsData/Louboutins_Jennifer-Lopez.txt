[Intro]
Uh uh oh ahh radio killer
Taking back my love [x5]

[Verse 1]
You said you changed
But still nothing
You're still the same
I'm just a part time lover
And I'm the blame
Should have went away
But yet I stayed
With a part time lover

[Pre-Chorus]
See, someday's you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

[Chorus]
Now you got me stressing out
On the phone
But it's the last time, I'm moving on
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins [x9]

[Verse 2]
I left the state
Changed everything
No more (818)
For the part time lover
What goes around
Comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

[Pre-Chorus]
See, someday's you will love me
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't
Then you're here, then you're gone
I'm alone

[Chorus]
[x8]

[Verse 3]
Watch these Red bottoms
And the back of my jeans
Watch me go, bye baby
Don't know what you got until it's gone
Tail Lights is all you'll see
Watch this Benz exit
That driveway

[Chorus][x8]

[Bridge]
Watch me walk it out
Walk it out, walk it out
Walk this right up
Out the house
Walk it out watch me walk it out
Walk it out walk this right up out the house

[Chorus][x8]
