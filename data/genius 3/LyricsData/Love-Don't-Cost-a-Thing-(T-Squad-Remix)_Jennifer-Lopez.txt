1 - [Jennifer Lopez]
Think you gotta keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm gonna spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing
Think I wanna drive your Benz, I don't
If I wanna floss, I got my own
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rollie bling
Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But you're hard to miss, think you outta know
Doesn't really matter if you're balling out of control

2 - All that matters is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy yeah

Repeat 1

When I took a chance
Thought you'd understand
Baby credit cards aren't romance
Still you're tryna buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores
Seen a side of you that I really feel
You're doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?
I've got to go

Repeat 2

Repeat 1

A thing, a thing, a thing
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Fat Joe]
Yeah uh money can't buy love
Well love can't buy a damn thing
See if love buy you champagne
See if a hug buys a damn ring
Or that Dolce dress with a slit up the hamstring
I ain't tryna buy your heart with mine
But I'm eatin' now, how I'mma starve my honey
If I went broke today, I'd be blacker than blind
Catch a case just to keep your face between rocks
Even if we had to live in a box
I'll make the sacrifice
Tell you go ahead and live with your pops
Come on ma you know better
Even though you got your own chedda
We can spend mine together
Can't lie, even think about us dying together
In the same house, that we plan to buy together
Jenny it's all about you
I only trick cause I'm allowed to
But it don't mean ish without you

[Jennifer]
You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
To get the keys into my heart
Think you can win my heart
Don't know what's in my heart
I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

Repeat 1 till end
