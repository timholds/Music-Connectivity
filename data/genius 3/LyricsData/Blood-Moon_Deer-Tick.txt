In you I was invited
So in your arms I'll die
Every other man got away
But I won't even try

Twenty coins in your pocket
Twenty nails in your coffin
With faith and salvation
Oh, you must be joking

Now the moon has a watchful eye
And it bleeds in the sky
And the red rock drips on rocket ships
And you hid your eyes
Cause you just couldn't take it

Years of delusion put scars on your face
And we'd make the earth quake
With each step that we'd take
You're hung on your mission
Of destroying your vision
Constricted and timid
You're a time bomb ticking

All the heavens in the clouds
Are a pendulum swinging on down
So hurry up young man
Go and bury your head
And know no one's around right now
To water the ground

Hey big daddy what's on your mind?
All the things that you're thinking of all the time
Is it heresy to speak of or an undying love?
If you told me, it wouldn't change me
You said you'd act boldly but your hesitating
Now if I escape and I'll never come around
Well, you won't learn nothing until you bend down
And taste the ground
Taste the ground

All the colors, grey
In your head made of hay
Won't you take me now?
For the hearst will stop
Then the flesh will rot
And the blood moon we see is an act
It's an act of God
