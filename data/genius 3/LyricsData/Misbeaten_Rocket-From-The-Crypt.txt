Ah, something's wrong with Gertrude
Ah, she don't like the attitude
On the nose she can't understand
If you touch it, she will burn your hand

Ah, something's gotten into her

(Her) Lipstick stains and peppermint sticks
Your bad taste can't do the trick
She wears the cop's face down
Miss that beat. All right! Yeah! Ah (x6)

Ah, I need a second to relax
Ah, a flag to fly and win you fast
And if you try to force her to be King
She ain't never gonna be your Queen

Ah, something's gotten into her

(Her) Lipstick stains and peppermint sticks
Your bad taste can't do the trick
She wears the cop's face down
Miss that beat. All right! Yeah! Ah (x6)

You don't miss that beat (x3). You don't miss that
