Where evil dwells, I hide my face
In empty rooms, the ghostly chase
Did you miss me? I seemed so sure
The days seem longer, now you're gone
The devil rides, right next to me
My broken thoughts, my last release
Did you miss me? I seemed so sure
The days seem longer, now you're gone
Did you miss me? I seemed so sure
The days seem longer, now you're gone
Try as I might, I'll never understand
What's inside, the hearts of strangers
