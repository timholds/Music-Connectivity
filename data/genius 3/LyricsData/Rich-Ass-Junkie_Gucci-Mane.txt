[Intro]
Ha, everybody no one

[Verse 1]
Wrist on hockey, Pimp C cocky
Rich ass junkie and my phone keep jumpin'
Different type of water from a different type of faucet
Neighborhood watchin' try to cut into my profit
Rich ass junkie Louie V down to the wallet (Louie)
Different clientele hit my line you know we got it (Gucci)
Fresh up out parole, keep it in a row (woah)
Balling out control, cash out on your hoe (hoe)
Money down the drain, dog food in the vein (oh)
Cause I'm the one that serving her am I the one to blame? (no)
Crack cocaine, got my cousin losing weight
Used to be a plug, now he just a chay
Snorting his life away, a couple G's a day
But now he on the flake he so small he blew away (smoke)
Rich ass junkie, same sad story
Drunk reminiscing, 'bout his dope boy glories (what)

[Chorus]
Rich ass junkie, rich ass junkie
I'm trappin' out the lob, serving rich ass junkies
Rich ass junkie, rich ass junkie
In the Six, gettin it off, serving rich ass junkies
Rich ass junkie (gato), rich ass junkie (gato)
Round around the city serving rich ass junkies
Rich ass junkie, rich ass junkie
Diamonds on my neck (brr), rich ass junkies

[Verse 2]
A doughboy with a check, flexin' on his ex (ex)
Diamonds on his neck, he say he got next (huh?)
On Instagram he posts the set them boys just set the blitz (go)
Dope boy posts with bricks, what type of shit is this? (wow)
He told his innocents, I cease'em and desist (stop!)
Dope boys doing junkie stuff, I didn't know it exists (huh?)
I take four to a six, you should pay a ten (yes)
Tension building up so im gon send my shooters in
If we hit we win, if we miss we go again (go)
Diamonds on my crucifix, it's so hard not to sin
If I'm my brothers keeper, why he don't want me to win? (whoa)
Still on my knees, praying for them in the pen (free 'em)
Rich ass junkie, I started a trend (Gucci)
Rich ass junkie, I mix it with gin
Rich ass junkie, cook it, one more spin (gato)
Rich ass junkie, I whipped up a benz (gato)

[Chorus]
Rich ass junkie, rich ass junkie
I'm trappin' out the lob, serving rich ass junkies
Rich ass junkie, rich ass junkie
In the Six, gettin it off, serving rich ass junkies
Rich ass junkie, rich ass junkie
Round around the city serving rich ass junkies
Rich ass junkie, rich ass junkie
Diamonds on my neck, rich ass junkies
