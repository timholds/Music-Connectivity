[Chorus:] [x2]
I'll be on my paper chasing [scratch]
Making money everyday

[Verse 1:] [Gangsta Boo]
Bitches broke, You fools better fix it up
This good weed I'm smoking, You will never catch me slipping man
This album is a joke, Tryna be Boo, but you cannot be hoe
I'm still getting change from shit I did the longest time ago
I'm so self made it's a shame, got no shame in how I get it
Paper chasing elevator[?] niggas out this shit
Always in the VIP, I never wait in line
If they say they saw me one a them haters is a liar
Solo when I go shop, I trust no man but Benji
When I wake up he gon be the same but people envy
The almighty dollar, bitch I'm focused on my fortune
I don't pay attention to the ??? from those broke hoes
Paper chase

[Chorus] [x4]

[Verse 2:] [Beatking]
Hold up
I'll be on my paper chase
[?] bitch my paper straight
VIP, 20 deep with show bitch and ace of spades
Pour it on that bitch cuz we dont love her but you do
Gangsta Boo say she hates these ratchet hoes, I'm like 'you too?'
Bitch I know you sample me
This that fucking get it green
Was puffing this shit when i was 17
Its that [?] with a couple [?]
Bad hoes on my fucking team
Beatking, I get fucking cream
All my wu tang, C3 what my crew thing
I swing like my snap [?]
Hold up bitch, pour up with that mountain dew
[?] in the slam trunk with the slow motion
[?] Godzilla, I get scrilla, bitch i'm thrilla, wadup Bon?
Pussy killer, big gorilla on my throne, done... hold up

[Chorus] [x4]
