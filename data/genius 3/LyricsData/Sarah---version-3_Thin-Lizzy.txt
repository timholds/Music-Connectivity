Captains hair
Shone softly in the sun
Rode on his best mare
To Sarah
School-boy eyes
Would stare with innocent fun
Never told no lies
He loved Sarah
Whispered by a bramble
Carried by a brook
To every fisher's hook
Sarah
Fragrant fields
Playing croquet in the sun
Nothing appeals
Like Sarah
Whispered by a bramble
Carried by a brook
To every fisher's hook
Sarah
