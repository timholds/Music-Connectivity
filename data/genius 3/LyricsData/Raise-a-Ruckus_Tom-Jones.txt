[Chorus]
Come along, little children, come along
While the moon is shining bright
Get on board, down the river float
Raise a ruckus tonight!

[Verse 1]
I love my wife, I love my baby
I love that biscuit dipping in gravy
Save me the hambone , give me the gravy
I love my biscuits sopped in gravy

[Chorus]
Come along, little children, come along
While the moon is shining bright
Get on board, down the river float
Raise a ruckus tonight!

[Verse 2]
Now when I die, won’t you bury me deep
Put molasses on my head, on my feet
Put them flapjacks in my hand
All the way to the promised land

[Chorus]
Come along, children, come along
While the moon is shining bright
Get on board, down the river float
And raise a ruckus tonight!

[Verse 3]
Now some folk say that the preacher don’t steal
Well, I caught one in my corn-field
One had a bushel, one had a peck
One had a rooster around his neck

[Chorus]
Come along, little children, come along
While the moon is shining bright
Get on board, down the river float
Raise a ruckus tonight!

[Chorus]
Come along, little children, come along
While the moon is shining bright
Get on board, down the river float
Raise a ruckus tonight!

Why don't you raise a ruckus tonight?
Come on and raise the ruckus tonight!
