"When your feathers are soaked and your eyes are too bloody to see
And you pulled every punch that you had but there's one that you need
Then you've waited too long
There's a hole in your heart
And all you've become is emotionally overrun

Chorus:
Wishing wells were made to echo a dime
The consequences are you keep on relying
You've become a run and hide refugee
Baby I'm a cop, stop, put up your hands and surrender to me

You're gonna get hooked if there's anything left I can do
You've already disarmed it's your lasting alarm I pursue
You can loosen those fists
C'mon blow me a kiss
You've been roughed up enough to deserve some relief from your troubles
So I'm coming in

CHORUS

Otherwise, I would never tell you what to do despite
Any indecision though I know I'm right
Arguing was always my forte
And one thing I can say is I won't tell you lies
Or treat you like a rental car like other guys
And if you think I'm crazy find an alibi
Cause you will need some evidence to show

CHORUS

Baby I'm a cop, stop, put up your hands and surrender to me
