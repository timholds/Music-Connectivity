[Verse 1 - Sade]
I think I'll fall to pieces
If I don't find something else to do
This sadness, it never ceases
Oh, I'm still in love with you
My headache keeps on reeling
It's got me in a crazy spin
Darling, darling, darling
Is this the end?

[Hook - Sade]
Still in love with you

[Verse 2 - Sade]
They say time has a way of healing
Dries all the tears from your eyes
Darling, it's this empty feeling
That my heart can't disguise
After all that we've been through
I try all my best, but it's no use
I guess I just keep loving
Is this the end?

[Hook - Sade]
Still in love with you

[Verse 3 - Sade]
Now it's all over boy
There's something I think you should know
Baby, let me think it over
Just one more time before you go
Call on me, baby
If there's anything I can do for you
Please call me baby
Help me see if through
