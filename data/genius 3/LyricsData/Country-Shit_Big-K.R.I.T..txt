[Hook]
Let me tell you bout' this
Super fly dirty dirty
Third coast muddy water
Shawty, pop that pussy if you wanna
Let me tell you bout' this
Old school, pourin' lean
Candied yams and collard greens
Pocket full of stones, riding clean
Let me tell you bout this country shit
Country country shit
Let me tell you bout this country shit
Country country shit
Let me tell you bout this country shit
Country country shit
Let me tell you bout this country shit
Country country shit
Country country shit

[Verse 1]
I told 'em aw man hold up, what you know about it
Candy cars, superstar, rubberbands in my pocket
A couple broads for the popping, if she ridin then she bopping
Bitch I'm sellin if you shopping, if you need it then I got it
If I want it then I cop it, if you don't like nigga top it
Why you worried bout mine ho, what's up in your wallet?
I was riding my Screw shit, rims chop chopping
Top dropping throwin bread crumbs, crows start flocking
Knockin pictures off the wall, we sit tall, and we still crawl
We still shoot, we still score, we still win, so we still ball
We still hood so fuck them laws, I got nuts and I got loot
If you can't see the king in a nigga like me undoubtedly, then fuck you too

[Hook]
Let me tell you bout' this
Super fly dirty dirty
Third coast muddy water
Shawty, pop that pussy if you wanna
Let me tell you bout' this
Old school, pourin' lean
Candied yams and collard greens
Pocket full of stones, riding clean
Let me tell you bout this country shit
Country country shit
Let me tell you bout this country shit
Country country shit
Let me tell you bout this country shit
Country country shit
Let me tell you bout this country shit
Country country shit
Country country shit

[Verse 2]
Okay the Caddy still swangin', and the trunk still bangin'
Nigga trickin' ain't pimpin' shawty, what is y'all thankin'?
What what is y'all sayin? What what is y'all sangin'?
Hit the club by the bar, like what is y'all drankin'?
Old schools, foreign cars shawty, what is y'all crankin'?
Kush blunts Bank tellers ask me "Why is y'all stankin?"
If it's money out here shawty, why is y'all playin'?
She was bound to fuck a pimp so why is you cakin'?
Save it ho, cape crusader at her service aidin' ho
Damn the ho, blame the ho for the same shit you pay me for
Shake it more for a pimp with my shrimp on my plate
Countryfied, country fly with a tape

[Hook]
Let me tell you bout' this
Super fly dirty dirty
