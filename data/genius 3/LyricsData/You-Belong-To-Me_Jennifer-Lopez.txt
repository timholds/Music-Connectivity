[Verse 1]
Why'd you tell me this
Were you looking for my reaction
What do you need to know?
Don't you know Iâ€™ll always be your girl
You don't have to prove to me your beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own

[Chorus]
You belong to me
Tell her, tell her you were fooling
You belong to me
You don't even know her
You belong to me
Tell her that I love you
You belong to me
You belong to me

[Verse 2]
Can it be bunny, that your not sure
You belong to me
Thought we'd close the book and lock the door
You don't have to prove to me your beautiful to strangers
I've got loving eyes of my own, of my own
And I can tell, I can tell, darling

[Chorus] [x2]

You....belong....to....me (you belong to me)
You....belong....to....me (you belong to me)
You....belong....to....me (you belong to me)
You....belong....to....me (you belong to me)
You....belong....to....me (you belong to me)
You....belong....to....me (you belong to me)
You....belong....to....me (you belong to me)
You....belong....to....me (you belong to me)
You....belong....to....me (you belong to me)
