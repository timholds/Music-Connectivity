Yeah

[Corey "Koko" Whittingham]
Baby won't you let me hold you
In my arms for ever more
I conduct your fantasy
In a private symphony

[Maestro Fresh Wes]
Picture you and I
Way up in the sky
Flying over oceans, while the clouds go passing by
I kiss you on your lips, and taste your scented neck
We're going on a trip, we'll never ever forget
I'll take you on a voyage (voyage), travelling hand in hand
Yeah, I'm like an orchestra
Your body, I command
Conducting, instructing, you won't need to move
I'll tell you straight up girl, won't nobody disturb this groove
You've been more than just my lover
You've been my lady, a special friend to me
So take my hand and lets engage in a private symphony

CHORUS [Koko]
Darling let me dedicate this
Moment to my love affair
Look into my eyes well can't you see
[Maestro] You and me
[Koko] In a private symphony

[Maestro]
We'll make love all night, and all through the morning
I'll still hold you tight (tight), while the beautiful sunset's forming
See, we don't need no band baby
Or no rhythmn section (rhythmn, rhythmn, rhythmn)
'Cause in this symphony, harmony is made, from affection
We'll be rolling, squeezing, pleasing each other girl (yeah baby, yeah)
All over and over and over again, I could never ever love another
While the harmony plays, our love will never fade
Because from this day, 'til eternity sweet music will be made
'Cause you've been more than just my lover
You've been my lady, a special friend to me
So take my hand and lets engage in a private symphony

[Koko] Baby won't you let me hold you
[Maestro] I want to hold you baby
[K] In my arms for ever more
[M] I want to hold you in my arms
[K] I conduct your fantasy
[M] I'll conduct all your fantasies baby, you and me
[K] In a private symphony
[M] In a private symphony

[Maestro] ** CHORUS in background **
I want to dedicate this
To you baby
Look at me
Look into my eyes
Can't you see
You and me
In a private symphony, yeah
Private symphony, you and me

[Koko]
It spins for you and me
Hold me, I want you by my side honey

[Maestro]
Private Symphony

[Koko]
Never let me go
