See if I can do without reading...
Loving is what I can give to you
So tell me you love me, cause I know you do
Every night you go to sleep
Tell me am I on your mind?
We could be sleeping in the streets
But if I'm with you I feel so fine

In the morning you'll be gone and it all goes away
Tell me that you gotta leave, but I know you wanna stay
Deep within your conscious, the place that I reside
Running out of options, baby, you be wasting all my time

It gets a little crowded, all the things running through my mind
Maybe I'll be able to tell you one day, hopefully soon
Last night we were high, floating over the moon
Smoking with you, I'm smoking with you

Life's what you make it
Wear my heart out on my sleeve
Baby, you my favorite
Sorry if I'm staring
Your body just so sacred
Come with me, running free
Now we getting faded

[Hook]
I hope, my, suspicions ain't been right all along
You are, all I know for so long
We both, agree we don't know what's going on (gone, gone, gone, gone)
You my fantasy gone wrong

If love is a feeling that got you afraid
Maybe it's time to start walking away
Your beauty like something I saw in a painting; amazing
The world never seen something like you

Every morning that I wake up, wish you were laying next to me
Tell me what you're made of, girl, say what you believe
Sleeping with somebody else, tell me what I'm missing
I see it all in your face, you're such a politician

And these days we ain't talking as much as we used to
You miss me, but shit keeps spiraling out of control
But we changed into two different people, I noticed
I miss you, continue to slowly lose you, I know

[Hook]
I hope, my, suspicions ain't been right all along
You are, all I know for so long
We both, agree we don't know what's going on (gone, gone, gone, gone)
You my fantasy gone wrong
