1 - Never mind that he don't love you
Never mind that he don't care
I'll give you love the way you want it
Say it's alright and I'll be there
I'll be right there

Shoulda known it when I saw you baby
Shoulda never let him call you, baby
No matter how I try
No longer can I hide
The way I feel
That's why I'm asking you

Repeat 1

Girl I got places I want you to be
And so many things I want you to see
If you'd only put your trust in me
Baby I'll show you love

2 - Oh baby, I wanna put a smile upon your face
Oh lady say yes and I'll be where you are
Right there

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

Repeat 1 until fade
