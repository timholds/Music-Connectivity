Back to nature
Caravan on canvey sand
Back to nature
Glucose filled, and programmed to respond

It's gonna rain all night
But we'll be alright
Under the geodesic dome
Infrared heats it just like home
Sitting in the shade of a rubber tree
I'll kiss you and you'll kiss me

Back to nature
Burning bodies in the sun
Back to nature
Just like lemmings, every one
Back to nature
Catalyst aircraft fill the air
Back to nature
Aerosol ambre solaire

It's gonna rain all night
But we'll be alright
Under the geodesic dome
Infrared heats it just like home
Sitting in the shade of a rubber tree
I'll kiss you and you'll kiss me

Back to nature

With my back to nature

Back to nature

Turn my back to nature

Back to nature
Back to nature
