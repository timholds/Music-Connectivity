[Verse 1: June]
Uh, big pimpin', chrome tippin'
A hundred spokes, full of gold, nigga
We livin' life, getting money, just me and my niggas
Only for the real, stay out of the picture
A young boss from the M, loyal to the game (Alright)
Ain’t no love for these hoes, just stick to the plan (Alright)
That money talk real fast, hope you understand (Alright)
We pop bands on that ass, make them bitches dance (Alright)
Ooo, Southside, baby
Posted in the cut, we gettin’ high, baby
They say it’s all love, I’m ready to ball out
As long as the money comin', she tryna go all night
(100!)

[Hook]
I’m big pimpin', I’m big pimpin'
I’m big pimpin', you know I stay sippin'
I’m big pimpin', I’m big pimpin'
I’m big pimpin', you know I stay sippin'

I’m big pimpin', I’m big pimpin' (Westside, playa)
I’m big pimpin', you know I stay sippin' (Northside, playa)
I’m big pimpin', I’m big pimpin' (Eastside, playa)
I’m big pimpin', you know I stay sippin' (Southside, playa)

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
One time for the freaks
Two times for the "bust its"
Three hoes in my bucket, super cluckin’
Down to suck me, kiss and rubbin’ on each other
Ain’t no question that they fuckin’
Shawty gushin' all in my Cutlass
I told her toot that ass up and bust it
Worried 'bout that money, I don’t worry bout these pros, mane (Alright)
Servin' pimpin' to yo' bitch, like I’m the dope mane (Alright)
Since I can remember, told her get it off the floor, mane (Alright)
She was 'bout it, like you wouldn’t even know, mane (Alright)
Woah mane, I ain’t know that was ya ho, mane
In the V-I, you would think I had a show, mane
Beat her 'til she sore, mane
She was trained to go, mane
Wit' this pimpin', bitch, I'm 32 below, mane
(KRIZZLE!)
