[Verse 1]
What do you need from me?
What should I expect?
What do you see in me?
What do I see in you?

[Verse 2]
What have you been doing?
What have you been saying?

[Pre-Chorus]
She would be saying that you were a liar
And she would be loving this, you ought to let her
But shade ain’t a place that can set you on fire
So that leaves me, leaves me

[Chorus]
You warm me up, you wore me down, I get the feeling now
You warm me up, you warm me up
You warm me up, you wore me down, I get the feeling now
You warm me up, you warm me up

[Verse 3]
What do you want from me?
Do you need from me?
Do you need from me?

[Verse 4]
How do I get through to you?
Do I get through to you?
Do I get through?
Do I get through?

[Pre-Chorus]
She would be saying that you were a liar
And she would be loving this, you ought to let her
But shade ain’t a place that can set you on fire
So that leaves me, leaves me

[Chorus]
You warm me up, you wore me down, I get the feeling now
You warm me up, you warm me up
You warm me up, you wore me down, I get the feeling now
You warm me up, you warm me up

[Chorus]
You warm me up, you wore me down, I get the feeling now
You warm me up, you warm me up
You warm me up, you wore me down, I get the feeling now
You warm me up, you warm me up

[Chorus]
You warm me up, you wore me down, I get the feeling now
You warm me up, you warm me up
You warm me up, you wore me down, I get the feeling now
You warm me up, you warm me up
