(Biggie mom)
Let's say there are many times I looked
And saw reflections of my son
I argued sometimes, consulted;
I saw results, and said "Well done."

I thought of him constantly
And silently asked "Why?"
I tried fervently
And just cannot say goodbye

I lived with visions twined and twisted
Passion so cold
And withered thoughts, battered and shattered
I dreamed dreams
Cherished memories
Housed friendship
And promises that mattered

In the end
Time is treasured;
But love for my son?
It's everlasting
