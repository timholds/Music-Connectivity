[Verse 1]
I've got a pocket but it won't be full in a long time
I got a locket but the photos missing
'Cause nobody's listening at all
I get my hopes up for love, what I think is love
And when it blows up
I jump on the bandwagon with all the pretenders
...Wait a second

[Chorus]
You can call it aches and pains and games
The fire and the rain you can't explain
So you can call it anything, call it what you like
But don't call it love when it's really life

[Verse 2]
I'm not saying I don't believe in fairies
I've seen them fly around a couple times
But I don't like to labels things like jars of jam
'Cause when I get to taste these things
Its never what I planned
And I won't be a pretender
...Wait a second

[Chorus]
You can call it aches and pains and games
The fire and the rain, you can't explain
So you can call it anything, call it what you like
But don't call it love when it's really life

[Bridge]
I don't wanna be rude to myself, stop leading me on
Rude to myself, if I don't try to be right, can't be wrong
I just wanna be true to myself and take the day as it comes
True to myself, I know I'm not the only one
I know I'm not the only one

[Chorus x2]
You can call it aches and pains and games
The fire and the rain, you can't explain
So you can call it anything, call it what you like
But don't call it love when it's really life

[Outro]
Don't call it love when it's really life
