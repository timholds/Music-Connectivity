Whether in a penthouse or a cave dweller
I can tell you 'bout now I'm not a fortune teller
Grab a treat from Yosi, my muffin seller
Got mad technique like Rudy Van Gelder
And yes I got a plan I'm a carry out it
Yes, I'm pro-choice, I'm a-scream and shout it
Yes I love life and I try not to doubt it
Yes I'm gonna party cause I'm 'bout it 'bout it
When it rains I don't use an umbrella
When I write rhymes, I use indeli-ble ink
That will make you think
Flowing like water that you love to drink

NOW get busy

Sweet like a nut filled with Nutella
Creamy like buffalo mozzarella
Sneaking around you know I smell ya
Well I play ya like a peanut and throw the shell ya
Well I could give a fuzz if ya think you're a baller
I get so many huni 'round  you fall smaller
Middle school rapper and a proud yes y'aller
If ya think about your grandma go ahead call her
From the East Coast so I don't say hella
At the mic stand my performance is stellar
Pop the tape in and I listen to fella
I give a little shout to Nelson Mandela

NOW get busy

Known for the words that make you scream and holler
I'm Count Dooku to your Queen Amidala
Give a shout to Spiro or John Waller
I'm a student of the game and a bona fide scholar
So ease up on the bong to ease that coughin'
Butter's on the table now watch it soften
Bring in those beats and I'm a bring them often
I'm a keep rappin' when I'm in my coffin
Like a mind gone mad that is unwinding
In a padded room the walls you're climbing
Don't sign on the line if it looks binding
Ya have to get loose and find the lining

NOW get busy
