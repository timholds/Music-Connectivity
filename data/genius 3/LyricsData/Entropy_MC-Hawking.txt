[Intro]
Harm me with harmony
Doomsday, drop a load on 'em

[Verse 1]
Entropy, how can I explain it? I'll take it frame by frame it
To have you all jump and shout and saying it
Let's just say that it's a measure of disorder
In a system that is closed, like with a border
It's sorta like a well a measurement of randomness
Proposed in 1850 by a German, but wait I digress
"What the fuck is entropy?", I hear the people still exclaiming
It seems I gotta start the explaining
You ever drop an egg and on the floor you see it break
You go and get a mop so you can clean up your mistake
But did you ever stop to ponder why we know it's true
If you drop a broken egg you will not get an egg that's new
That's entropy or E-N-T-R-O to the P to the Y
The reason why the sun will one day all burn out and die
Order from disorder is a scientific rarity
Allow me to explain it with a little bit more clarity
Did I say rarity? I meant impossibility
At least in a closed system there will always be more entropy
That's entropy and I hope that you're all down with it
If you are here's your membership

[Chorus]
You down with entropy? (Yeah, you know me!) (x3)
Who's down with entropy? (Every last homey!)

[Verse 2]
Defining entropy as disorder's not complete
Cause disorder as a definition doesn't cover heat
So my first definition I would now like to withdraw
And offer one that fits thermodynamics second law
First we need to understand that entropy is energy
Energy that can't be used to state it more specifically
In a closed system entropy always goes up
That's the second law, now you know what's up
You can't win, you can't break even, you can't leave the game
Cause entropy will take it all 'though it seems a shame
The second law, as we now know, is quite clear to state
That entropy must increase and not dissipate
Creationists always try to use the second law
To disprove evolution, but their theory has a flaw
The second law is quite precise about where it applies
Only in a closed system must the entropy count rise
The earth's not a closed system, it's powered by the sun
So fuck the damn creationists, Doomsday get my gun
That, in a nutshell, is what entropy's about
You're now down with a discount

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Hit it!
Doomsday, kick it in!
