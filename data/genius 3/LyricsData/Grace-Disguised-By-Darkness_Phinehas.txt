I've felt their lives slip through my fingers
Now I watch them circle the drain
With breath like the torrent (THEY SINK)
To the bottom
I've wasted so many chances
My efforts' not a drop in the barrel
With a body like a boulder (I SINK)
To the bottom

I've shown my teeth and have had them kicked in one too many times
In my yearning He split the rock, and the water gushed forth

A voice keeps yelling, a voice keeps yelling
"This is where your proud waves end"
My fingers trace lines, on the surface I'm consumed
The sinking feeling, the sinking feeling
"This is where your proud waves end"
I take my first step, I'm thrown over the edge

I TRIED TO WALK ON THE WATER, BUT NOW I JUST SWIM

They slipped through my fingers
Now I watch them circle the drain
With breath like the torrent (THEY SINK)
To the bottom
I've wasted so many chances
My efforts' not a drop in the barrel
With a body like a boulder (I SINK SINK)
To the bottom

I scream your name
Are you outside of your wrath?
Oh God, I scream your name

And amongst the pile of dead...

I see a light split the water from the heavens
And I feel God glowing inside me
My heart SHAKES with the music of the spheres
I no longer tremble in fear
For Redemption has found me
And in Redemption comes the overflow...

... of peace
