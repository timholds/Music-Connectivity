[Verse One: Party Arty]
Straight like that
I'm the dirtiest nigga here
What you don't know, nigga yeah
I'm the one niggas fear, my niggas care
About nothing, but you? About frontin
When me and the track meet, it ain't about runnin
Gunnin, verses at you, leave you stiff like a statue
Riff and I'ma clap you, flip, son 'cause I had to
Get at you dog, like DMX, leave you bloody like BMS
Leavin in EMS

[Verse Two: A.G.]
I'm the dirtiest nigga here, and we can bet
See me vibe with the niggas we respect
And see the rest, peep the sketch
It's seventy-four, raw as ever
My design is to shine in any era
My-I, fucks with G.I., the hood is crazy
Got a nigga drinkin Dany and smokin ceejas
Checkin my closest peeps on V.I.'s
Giuliani and that RICO shit, and me don't mix

[Verse Three: D-Flow]
Flow the dirtiest nigga here
Blow Hershey in the air, you scared nigga wipe ya tears
Even got snipers scared, tryna drink lighter beers
Blaze more trees, play more freaks
Rubbin they cheecks, nut on they sheets, fuck on they beats
Flow boo, you should know two things
It's like I got two brains the way I do things
Move 'caine, always wanted to fuck a chick name 2Swing
But I tell you about her later dog 'cause it's a group thing
We up in blue flame, spittin shit, chair me on
Drink more beer than all, nigga fear the storm from here's on

Who the dirtiest?
Who the dirtiest?
Where you at my nigga?

I'm the dirtiest nigga here
Rhymes never been washed, crimes never been solved
G.D. is better than y'all
Filthy, is how I be on a song
I get dirty nigga so fuck it, now I'm the Dirty Don
Freak nigga, lookin hunt at her stairs
Dick so hard feel like I got a gun in my pants
If you fuck me, you got to fuck one of my mans
Catch me runnin out a bank, with a gun in my hands

[Verse Four: A.G.]
I'm the dirtiest nigga here
And I'll get grimy just to prove it
Take your track and loop it, use it just to use it
That's what you say, but I say
That's not the way we do our music
Love this shit here, and won't abuse it
Exclusive, on some Funkmaster or Clue shit
Move is like Eric Wright, can't write to no smooth shit
They lose it, when they hear me rap
Roll deep, hold heat, Show beats is off the meat rack
And all I know is crime and rhyme
Hot like '97, drop in '98 - so I'm straight for '99

[Verse Five: Party Arty]
I'm the dirtiest nigga here
And you can hear it from a mile away
I be around the way, drinkin Bacardi and Aliz√©
In the black Benz pumpin Biggie shit
Get dirty, fuck the jiggy shit
Straight from New York, my whole city spit
See me on fifty-fifth, drinkin St. Ide's
We call it Ide-it, still the same guy, G.D. affiliate
While I'm in this game I got a mil' to get
Filler shit, Party Arty still'a spit
Realler shit, iller shit, killer shit
Hit you with three, on some real Reg' Miller shit
Just to let you know what I'm dealin with

Who the dirtiest? I'm the dirtiest
Who the dirtiest? I'm the dirtiest
I'm the dirtiest, I'm the dirtiest
Who the dirtiest? What.. I'm the dirtiest!
