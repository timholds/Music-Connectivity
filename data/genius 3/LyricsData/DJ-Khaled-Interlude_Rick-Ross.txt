[Verse: DJ Khaled]
Trilla
I hope you're all enjoying yourselves
This is the DJ Khaled throwin' down to aka the big dog Pitbull
Terrasquadian aka we da best, aka Dade County, 305, the movement
We are here forever, Rick Ross
We survive through every storm, any weather, any road block, any fuck nigga
We here forever and we ain't never gon' stop
Rick Ross is the definition of the projects
Ricky Ross is the definition of the ghetto
Rick Ross is the definition of the slums
Rick Ross is the streets
You see Rick Ross is like the poor people President
He represents the struggle
He's the level of the hustle
I am DJ Khaled
And I'mma stand beside Rick Ross for the rest of my life
Through the good times, through the bad times
See, we will never be stopped
Never, cause we the mutherfuckin' best
Ayo, E-Class man, hold this man, my machine broke
From countin' too much cash, believe that haha
