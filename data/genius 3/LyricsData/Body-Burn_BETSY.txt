[Intro]
Take my body and burn
Take my body and burn
Take my body and burn my heart away

[Verse 1]
You gave me hope
But you blew it all
You took it all
Took it all apart
You lay me low
And you take me high
You gave my soul
Such a lonely tone

[Chorus]
So take my body and burn, burn, burn
Take my body and burn my heart away
Take my body and burn, burn, burn
Take my body and burn my heart away

[Verse 2]
You knew it all
And you knew the score
Couldn’t take one look at me
Couldn’t find no strength to fall
Now I long for the light
And I pray for the day
And I search for the flame
To burn it all away

[Chorus]
So take my body and burn, burn, burn
Take my body and burn my heart away
Take my body and burn, burn, burn
Take my body and burn my heart away

[Bridge]
Oh, take my body and burn
Take my body and burn
Take my body and burn my heart away
Take my body and burn
Take my body and burn
Take my body and burn my heart away
Away

[Outro]
So I close my eyes
For a moment of peace
Don’t pity my soul
Such a lonely tone
Such a lone, lonely, lonely tone
Such a lone, lonely, lonely tone
Such a lone, lonely, lonely
Lonely, lonely
Take my body and, take my body and, take my body and, take my body and
I close my eyes
And I close my eyes
