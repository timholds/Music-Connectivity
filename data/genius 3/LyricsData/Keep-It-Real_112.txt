You just
Don't know
The way you make us feel
Through your work
And through your visions
So young, black, and gifted, ohh

Mary j's love was real
Notorious b-i-g, b-i-g
Craig mack's the brand new flava
And jodeci
Forever my lady

They just
They just
Don't know
The pains of being real
When the world is being sifted
From being young black and gifted

This is
So hard
To sing as we feel
People changing like the seasons
Without reason people try to keep it real

Keep it real
