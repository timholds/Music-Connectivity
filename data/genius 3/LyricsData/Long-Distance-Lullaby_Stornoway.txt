Goodnight, goodnight, the sun is long out of sight
And I stagger home by the streetlight
Goodnight, goodnight, went out after work tonight
Only meant to stay for a swift pint
And I'm giving you a call though I'm in no fit state
And I know it's far too late
And I'm hardly thinking straight
'Cause I've missed you
Ever since you moved away from here
And it's not the same this year
I wish I could teleport you here tonight to say
Goodnight soul mate, I know I'm in no state
To call you up and keep you up so late
But I had to hear you talking in my ear
I've been so lonely since you left me here
So goodnight, I'm back in through the door now
Here we go bouncing down the hall now
Goodnight, goodnight soul mate, oh, but if you were here tonight
We could climb up through the skylight
Remember lying in your attic
On those summer nights
Our hands trembling side by side
Those were the best days of my whole life
And now I know you're moving on
And I've been trying too
Trying not to speak to you
But I still can't sleep here without you to wish me a
Goodnight soul mate, I know I'm in no state
To call you up and keep you up so late
But I just had to hear you talking in my ear
I've been so lonely since you left me here
And I've got my friends
But I can't really talk to them
Like I can talk to you
Remember how we used to stay up very, very late and smoke
And listen did I say how much I miss you now?
I'm keeping you from sleeping now
I only called to wish you could be here tonight
To hold me while I'm wishing you a
Goodnight soul mate, I know I'm in no state
To call you up and keep you up so late
