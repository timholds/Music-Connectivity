Soon
It will be mornin'
And I have to rest my sight
But I don't want to
'Cause I know you're by my side
Oh, you, you are so beautiful
And forever I could stare
At the beauty
That I can see within your eyes
I love you
I'll take care of you
How I need you in my life
Time
It just passes by
But your light
It will live on
Like a chorus
Of a never ending song
Oh now, until forever
I will hold you close to me
'Cause there's nowhere
That I would rather be
'Cause I love you
I'll take care of you
How I need you in my life
So won't you stay this way
And don't let go
There are things you need to know
I love you
I'll take care of you
How I need you in my life
Ooh...ahh..ahh...ahh
La..la..la
Soon
It will be mornin'
And I have to rest
My sight....
