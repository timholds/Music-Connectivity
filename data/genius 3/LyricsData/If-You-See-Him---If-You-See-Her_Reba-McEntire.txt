[Verse 1]
If you see him
Tell him I wish him well
How am I doing?
Well, sometimes it's hard to tell
I still miss him more than ever
But please don't say a word

[Chorus]
If you see him
If you see him

[Verse 2]
If you see her
Tell her I'm doing fine
And if you want to
Say that I think of her from time to time
Ask her if she ever wonders
Where we both went wrong

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I still want her
I still need him so
I don't know why we let each other go
If you see her
Tell her the lights still on for her
Nothing's changed
Deep down the fire still burns for him

[Chorus][x2]
