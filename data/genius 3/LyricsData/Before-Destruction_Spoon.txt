[Verse]
Before destruction a man's heart is haughty
Everyone loves you for your black eye
They feast on the abundance of your house
Your love
I want to believe
For once to believe now
Just as you're leaving you turn around and take a cold shot
Just as you're turning your back

[Outro]
Ah love
Your love
