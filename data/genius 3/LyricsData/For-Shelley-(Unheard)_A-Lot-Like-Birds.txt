[Verse 1: Cory Lockwood]
I remember proudly stepping over glass
That you said could never cut me
If I walked where you walked
Kept my hand in your hand
So I clung onto you

I remember soundly leaping over rocks
That you promised I would never trip on
If I kept my eyes up nothing would surprise us
I always wondered how

[Chorus: Cory Lockwood]
You never seemed to fall
You never seemed to be out of place
Whenever we were lost
You'd end up happy there anyway

[Verse 2: Cory Lockwood]
I remember sleeping on a tile floor
Felt the nurses gently wake me
"Sir, you can come in now she's
Waiting to see you
I wish that she were well"

There were rocks in your back
There was glass in your hair
You tried to smile but it wasn't really there
You took my hand in your own, said "This feels like home"
And you begged me to take you there

[Chorus: Cory Lockwood]
You never seemed to fall
You never seemed to be out of place
Whenever we were lost
You'd end up happy there anyway

[Bridge 1: Matt Coate]
Saw you fading
Couldn't take it on my own
How I hate it
That a heart so warm
Can end up cold

[Bridge 2: Cory Lockwood]
I remember dreaming that this wasn't real
That you'd be there as I'm waking
We'd both deny we were scared

[Chorus: Cory Lockwood]
You never seemed to fall
You never seemed to be out of place
Whenever we were lost
You'd end up happy there anyway
