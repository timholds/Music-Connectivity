[Hook]
Mind goin' crazy, mind goin' crazy
Mind goin' crazy, I don't mind goin' crazy
Mind goin' crazy, mind goin' crazy
Mind goin' crazy, I don't mind goin' crazy
Get crazy, go stupid, get crazy, go stupid
Get crazy, go stupid, mind goin' crazy
Get crazy, go stupid, get crazy, go stupid
Get crazy, go stupid, mind goin' crazy

[Bridge 1]
Shop around by myself
Buying things for myself
Bring all the bags by myself
Can't forget the diamonds, note to self

[Verse 1]
I swear my outfit stupid-stupid
Yeah, I be stuntin' on 'em crazy-crazy
Diamonds shinin' stupid-stupid
Take it off the shelf, buy it if it's the latest

[Hook]

[Bridge 2]
Turn down for what?
I'm just having too much fun
I do it all for the love
But I ain't looking for love

[Verse 2]
Jewelry so heavy, purses so heavy
My homegirl is crazy so I'm with 'em forever
He never burn bridges but never say never
I go crazy, go stupid, these other girls can't do better
Cellphone all out of service, paying for roaming
They say "Girl, you crazy", I say "I'm already knowing"
I guess I'm just different, I do what it take
I be poppin' Hairfinity till my hair to my waist

[Hook]
