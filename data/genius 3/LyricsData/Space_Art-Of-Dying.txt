Too tight, so close, suffocating
Tonight, you know, I’m barely breathing
Why could you let it go?

It’s a fine line
And I’m running out of time
I’ve got a straight jacket on
I’ve got to get…

Space between us
Space between us
It’s those spaces between us
It rips us apart
And keeps us together

You speak, I talk, it doesn’t matter
You left, I’m gone, but not together
I can’t let it go

It’s a fine line
And I’m running out of time
I’ve got a straight jacket on
I’ve got to get…

Space between us
Space between us
It’s those spaces between us
It rips us apart
And keeps us together

It’s a fine line
And I’m running out of time
I’ve got a straight jacket on
I’ve got to get, I’ve got to get

Space between us
Space between us
It’s those spaces between us
It rips us apart
And keeps us together
It rips us apart
And keeps us together
It rips us apart
And keeps us together

Space, space
