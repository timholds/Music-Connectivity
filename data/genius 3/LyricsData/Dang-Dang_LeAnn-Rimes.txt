[Verse 1]
Whatever gets you off on life
Whatever gets you off on life
No judgement wrong or right
Yeah yeah, you made a believer out of me
Come on and lay your hands on me
Come on and lay your hands on me
Praise the Lord in all His might
Oh you made a believer out of me

[Chorus]
Dang dang you sure like to bang a lot
Dang dang you sure like to bang bang
Dang dang you sure like to bang a lot
Dang dang a bang, bang a dang dang

[Verse 2]
Late in the morning
In the early of the night
Ring a ting ting a ling
You shake shook me alright
Licker flickers liqueur's quicker
Effen sweat and starry eyed
Thought I was psycho bad
But you're morphine injectified

Whatever gets you off on life
Whatever gets you off on life
No judgement wrong or right
Oh you made a believer out of me
Come on and lay your hands on me
Come on and lay your hands on me
Praise the Lord in all His might
Oh you made a believer out of me

[Chorus]
Dang dang you sure like to bang a lot
Dang dang you sure like to bang bang
Dang dang you sure like to bang a lot
Dang dang a bang, bang a dang dang

[Bridge]
Resurrect me from sweet cherry suicide
If that's the way we go then what a way to die
Coochie hootchie chitchie hitchie wick a lily ding dang dong
I'm flying high with angels screaming sha-la-kah in tongues

Whatever gets you off on life
Whatever gets you off on life
No judgement wrong or right
Oh you made a believer out of me

[Chorus/Outro - Repeat until fade]
Dang dang you sure like to bang a lot
Dang dang you sure like to bang bang
Dang dang you sure like to bang a lot
Dang dang a bang, bang a dang dang
