[Chorus]
Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain will fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a cook but the food nah nuff
You're going to dance to Jah music, dance
We're going to dance to Jah music, dance, oh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Forget your troubles and dance
Forget your sorrows and dance
Forget your sickness and dance
Forget your weakness and dance

Cost of living gets so high
Rich and poor they start to cry
Now the weak must get strong
They say, Oh, what a tribulation

[Chorus]
Them belly full, but we hungry
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain will fall, but the dirt it tough
A pot a cook but the food nah nuff
You're going to dance to Jah music, dance
We're going to dance to Jah music, dance, oh-ooh

[Verse 2]
A belly full, but them hungry;
A hungry mob is a angry mob
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-cook, but the food nah nuff
A hungry man is a angry man;
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough;
A pot a-cook, but the food na nuff
A rain a-fall, but the dutty tough
A pot a-cook, but the food na nuff
A hungry mob is a angry mob;
A hungry mob is a angry mob
