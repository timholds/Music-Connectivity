Yo
Jumping in the mosh pit, I lost it
Choking a motherfucker, making 'em look like an ostridge
Aw shit!
I don't think you ready for Rap's Achmed
I said I'm a terrorist, you're in my bomb list, haunted
You're about to harness the monster on ganja
I'm offing all of the accomplices
I'm so fucking sick, instead of body guards I got pharmacists
And doctors walking around with me
Givin' me prescription pills for free
They'd kill for me cuz I rap so skillfully
I'm straight filthy, ain't nobody ill as me
Well maybe Em, Crooked and Tech
But we share the artillery:
Metaphors, syllable flows and banging beats for your system
Try to diss them, you'll be on the front page, missing
Listen, I've been silent studying this rap game
I know exactly what to do to get into that fast lane
Into your flatscreen
But I ain't gonna be no Mack Maine
I ain't gotta be wack and lame
To get yall to know my last name
I'mma stack green, but I ain't gonna be repeating it
Speaking shit, sounding weak and lit
I'd rather eternally plead the 5th!
