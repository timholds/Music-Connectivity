Uhh, hey
The fuck is poppin off out here?
G.D. nigga, the ave, y'knahmean?

Now yeah ma I turn words to flames
And - in one verse I can burn your brains
And - right from the party she like ice on her body
So when I got her naked she threw on my chain
41 shots to the lobby of your buildin
And keep shootin cause I probably ain't kill him
And that's in memory of Amadou Diallo
But keep on frontin that's what I'mma do to y'all though
Cruisin with a carload, not 50 we stuck
Look at that easy starmode induced
With a Dolce Gabbana bandana V
He's always jokin but stay with the hammer - me?
I'm on the low like Joe in Montana - no~!
I'm on the balcony like Tony Montana
Cause these niggas tried to hit me at the Copacabana
No - not cause of ki's cause my flow is bananas

[Hook]

[A.G.]
Your boy A.G. is back on his grizz'
And - yeah nigga, cause that's what it is
Wanna lean back with my wiz in immaculate cribs
Play the carpet, fall back with my kids, holla back at your nig
I live hard, I die hard, I think big
Got big balls, I fuck hard, so fuck y'all
King of the under, y'all wired for sound, singin the number
I wish you would, I'll bring you the lumber
I'm God like LL, in "In Too Deep"
When my pencil bleed it's like a minstrel bleed
I'm a weirdo, with a weird flow, y'all queer folk
Get some thongs or wear those nigga, yeah those
Y'all trash niggas wanna rap, I'm G.D
See me with five-oh, better have a nine in front of that
She gave me her mind because I rap
Then she gave me the lye, I stopped smokin ma nah I can't fuck with that

[Hook]
