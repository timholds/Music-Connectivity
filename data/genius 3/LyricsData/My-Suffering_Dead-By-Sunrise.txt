[Verse 1]
I've reached the end, and I don't know
(What I believe in anymore)
There's something crazy runnin' wild inside my brain
I've seen the truth become my lie
(Relive my shame, swallow my pride)
I've crossed the line and I know there's no turning back!

[Hook]
You kiss away all of my pain!
You wash away these bloody stains
You are to blame; my suffering
(My, my, my suffering)
You kiss away all of my pain!
You wash away these bitter stains
You are to blame; my suffering
(My, my, my suffering)

[Verse 2]
I've seen the devil in a smile
(I found salvation in a vial)
My happy ending exists only in my dreams!

[Hook]
You kiss away all of my pain!
You washed away these bloody stains
You are to blame; my suffering
(My, my, my suffering)
You kiss away all of my pain!
You washed away these bitter stains
You are to blame; my suffering

My suffering!

[Hook]
You kiss away all of my pain!
You washed away these bloody stains
You are to blame; my suffering
(My, my, my suffering)
You kiss away all of my pain!
You washed away these bitter stains
You are to blame; my suffering
You kiss away all of my pain!
You washed away these bloody stains
You are to blame; my suffering

[Outro]
(My, my, my suffering)
My suffering
(My, my, my suffering)
My suffering
(My, my, my suffering)
My suffering (My suffering)
