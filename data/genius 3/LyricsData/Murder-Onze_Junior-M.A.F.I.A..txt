[Intro: Cheek Del Vec]
Uhh (what?)
Trife & Larceny in the fuckin' house (uhh)
My nigga Klep in the fuckin' house (Kleptomaniac)
And me (uhh, uhh), Cheek Del Vec (Del Vec, aight) Aight!
(One love) Uhh, check it
(Snake-killin' ass niggas, JM one love)

[Verse 1: Del Vec, Kleptomaniac]
Del Vec, little niggas pushing Landcruiser jeeps
Gettin' blunted all day, every day of the week
Macks in Maxima's and Acura's
Got bitches drivin' 929 Mazda's, Tammy and Rhonda
Drivin' work down south in the Honda
I'm behind her, in the Pathfinder
Gettin' blunted, my nigga 'Ny on the XL 600
Ridin' smoothly playin' low-key, watch my bitch
With the brick in the Civic sellin' mad weight
Outta state and shit, I can't wait til this record shit is straight
So we can recuperate, get the dough and I'm gone

Motherfuckers fear me, I blow up spots like Ed Leary
Violent pro's leavin' with guns like Sharon Stone
Mack ass nigga strikes again, chalk my win
Kleptomaniac attracts CREAM stacks from eight pens
And sticky hands wit crazy glue like finger tips shoplift
Or pass crews on mountain bikes bustin' four-fifths
Diamond baguettes, Rolex for the bitch, flex
Sit back, sippin' Moet, signin' my signature on cheques
Crime motherfuckin' pays when you know what you're doin'
And gettin' loot since niggas was rockin' Hawaiian suits
What? Don't shoot *gun shot* leave ya family upset
Type to trip DT's chasin' down robbery suspects

[Chorus: Larceny]
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns

[Verse 2: Trife, Larceny]
Livin' life, gettin' richer, cos I move coke and bust quicker
Bitches get richer, jealous niggas wanna hit'cha
Stashin' my guns to protect my ones
I see the cash flow, touch it - I blast, you know how it go
In the 5-double 0 SL
Puffin L's lit while Larce loadin' shells in the clip

Snakes-murder men formin' plots
Lickin' shots outta drop tops and it don't stop
Us from gettin' the lucci creno
My clique tight like gambino's stickin' casinos
Bussin' down kilos, me and Trife for life
JM shorty's on the run
Cocksucker go get your guns

[Chorus: Larceny]
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns

[Verse 3: Klep, Del Vec, Trife]
I smoke so much weed, I know my lungs is fucked up
Stick guns I get'cha, spit sperm when I cum
Party done, used to hustle bubble
With concealed capsules under my tongue til my mouth got numb
Now I watch my back like my Spidey sense was tinglin'
Minglin' in clubs with JM puffin on raw tings
Don't oppose me, shit ain't rosy
Murderin' lyrical gangsta like Ini Kamoze

Del Vec project was set down south with two Tek
I murdered that, we got mad respect
Sheisty niggas and vicars puffin 20's and 50's on the block
I got shit on lock in Little Rock
My bitch got knocked, she sold to a undercover cop
Went to jail, put the Benz up for bail
Now I'm fucked up in the cut
I got to move to a diff'rent state to make some quick bucks

As I look around me, dead bodies surround me
Part of drug dealin'-killin' millions to make millions
Sittin' on top, tote Glocks
Smokin' pounds and Phillies by the box, gettin' head on the yacht
Presidential rollin', watch hoes clock me wit tha 420
Bodyin' motherfuckers for this money

[Chorus: Larceny]
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns
Murder Onze to get the funds, live fast or die young
JM motherfucker, go get your guns
