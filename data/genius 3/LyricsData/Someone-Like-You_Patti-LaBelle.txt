I've waited a lifetime
For someone just like you
Somebody who will take my hand
Someone who's warm and true
Romancing by candlelight
A touch from you thrills my heart
Say if you love me and it feels right
Nothing can keep us apart
All my life I've waited for someone like you
With a heart of gold
I always knew you would come my way
Ally my life I've waited for some like you
From now 'til the end of the time
That's how long I'll be loving you
Together we will live in paradise

A paradise made for two
All my prayers have been answered
And my dreams are reality
I feel complete whenever you're next to me
So I'm gonna hold on
I'll never let go, No, No
With a heart of gold, I always knew you would come my way
All my life I've waited for someone like
Everyday we'll make sunshine
Every night like the first time
Anything that's on your sweet mind
I'll make it happen for you and only you
Ain't no shame I my game
All my life I waited for you
