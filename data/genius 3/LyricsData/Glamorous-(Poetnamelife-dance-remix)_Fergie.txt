Are you ready?
If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home
You say:
If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home

G L A M O R O U S, yeah
G L A M O R O U S

We flyin' first class, up in the sky
Poppin' champagne, livin' my life
In the fast lane and I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy

The glamorous, the glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy

Wear them gold and diamonds rings
All them things don't mean a thing
Chaperones and limousines
Shopping for expensive thangs

I be on the movie screens
Magazines and bougie scenes
I'm not clean, I'm not pristine
I'm no queen, I'm no machine

I still go to Taco Bell
Drive through, raw as hell
I don't care, I'm still real
No matter how many records I sell

After the show or after the Grammys
I like to go cool out with the family
Sippin', reminiscing on days
When I had a Mustang and now I'm

First class, up in the sky
Poppin' champagne, livin' my life
In the fast lane, and I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy

The glamorous, the glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy

I'm talkin' champagne wishes, caviar dreams
You deserve nothin' but all the finer things
Now this whole world has no clue what to do with us
I've got enough money in the bank for the two of us

First I gotta keep enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish
Lifestyles so rich and famous Robin Leach will get jealous
Half a million for the stones, takin' trips from here to Rome
So if you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home

G L A M O R O U S, yeah
G L A M O R O U S
G L A M O R O U S, yeah
G L A M O R O U S

We flyin' first class, up in the sky
Poppin' champagne, livin' my life
In the fast lane, and I won't change
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy

The glamorous, the glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy
The glamorous, the glamorous, glamorous
By the glamorous, ooh, the flossy, flossy

I got problems up to here, I've got people in my ear
Telling me these crazy things that I don't want to know (fuck ya'll)
I've got money in the bank and I'd really like to thank
All the fans, I'd like to thank, thank you really though

'Cause I remember yesterday when I dreamt about the days
When I'd rock on MTV, that be really cool
Damn It's been a long road and the industry is cold
I'm glad my daddy told me so, he let his daughter know

(If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home)
My daddy told me so
(If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home)
He let his daughter know

(If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home)
My daddy told me so
(If you ain't got no money take yo' broke ass home)
He let his daughter know
