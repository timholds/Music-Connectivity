Now I'm around the way, yeah you got it, that's right
Checking this girl named Bonita, used to see her on the late night
I seen this kid I used to hustle with
Yo, he don't act the same since I got a name and I went legit
He's acting kind of shiesty
Think that he's jealous, that's what they tell us, I guess he might be
I'm not scrambling, but I'm still making G's
Not off of keys, but CD's and LP's
I got the word he's trying to rob me
Nigga used to be my man, damn, am I worried? No, not hardly
He forgot or he stopped believing
I'm the same brother on the block, pop pop for the slightest reason
If he want it, then it's no sweat
It's either kill or be killed, and I'm not ready to go yet
Yeah, we was cool, there was no-one cooler
But if my man try to flip, I'm going out like Rick the Ruler
He tried to get me but I lucked up, yup
He made his move but he fucked up, yup
So when I see him, he's a goner
His cashflow gotta be low because I'm locking down the street corners
Every day I'm on my P's and Q's
Since I'm clocking G's I'm packing twos
And you know four pounds is a lot of weight
I got him, straight through his chest so I guess that's checkmate
After he dropped, I copped a bag of tella
Throw on my hood like I should, I'm a Goodfella
And that late night bitch, she turned to a snitch
Started running with the lip, so I'm coming with a clip
Now she's returned, so tell me what have you learned?
If you try to pull my number then you're gonna get burned
