[Verse 1]
I was in a functional way
And I have my Brown Sound jacket
Queen of call collect on my arm
She was my calm-me-down
She was my good-luck charm
She was my good luck
Here it come running
Here it come running again
Trouble come running
Here it come running again

[Verse 2]
Well alright
I got taken away
By a heavenly host
To a heavenly place
I didn't want to leave
I would not be swayed

[Verse 3]
But here it come running
Here it come running again
Trouble where the kids are
Here it come running
Well are you picking up?
Are you picking up what I'm putting down?
Putting down
Running, here it come running
Ah, running again

[Verse 4]
Well done
I was in a functional way
And thinking clean clean thoughts
Effort just to keep my nose on
Just trying to look straight ahead
Don't want to tell him he's wrong
Want to tell him he's wrong

[Verse 5]
It come running
Here it come running
Where the kids are
Here it come running again
Slaves are on the horses
Princes walk the ground like they're slaves
Here it come running
Here it come running again
Running again[x3]
Ah, running
