The camera pans across the room
And finally comes to rest upon an old picture; framed

The photo shows a man in hat
A dog at heel, the man is fat
The dog is the same

Let me out...
Let me out...
Let me out...
I can't stand the dark anymore

A POV of man in carbon mononoxide fumes are choking him
His face turns pink

And now we see him winding down
The window streaked excretion brown
We watch him sink

Let me out...
Let me out...
Let me out...
I can't stand the dark anymore

The shot a wide angle now
A man is banging on the door
Of a chrome elevator
Lights go out no air inside
Get no lift from this lost ride
On a cracked generator

Let me out...
Let me out...
Let me out...
I can't stand the dark anymore

Now focus out
The lift goes down
Night creeps in
The screws go round
Blood runs cold
And now we stare up from our hole
Theme tune in, the credits roll
The story told

Let us out...
Let us out...
Let us out...
