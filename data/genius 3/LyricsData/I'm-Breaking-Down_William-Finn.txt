[TRINA]
I'd like to be a princess on a throne
To have a country I can call my own
And a king
Who's lusty and requires a fling
With a female thing

Great, men will be men
Let me turn on the gas
I caught them in the den with
Marvin grabbing Whizzer's ass

Oh sure, I'm sure, he's sure he did his best
I mean he meant to be what he was not
The things he was are things which I forgot
He's a queen
I'm a queen
Where is my crown?

I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down
My life is shitty
And my kid seems like an idiot to me
I mean that's sick
I mean he's great
It's me who is the matter
Talking madder
Than the maddest hatter

If I repeat one more word
I swear I'll lose my brain
Oh, what else should I explain?
Oh, yes it's true
I can cry on cue
But so can you

I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down
Down, down
You ask me "Is it fun to cry over nothing?"
It is, I'm breaking down

Now let's consider what I might do next
I hate admitting I've become perplexed
I'm bereaved
I've cried, I've shook, I've yelled, I've heaved
I have been deceived

As enemies go
Whizzer is not so bad
It's just he's so damn happy
That it makes me so damn mad

I want to hate him but I really can't
It's like a nightmare how this all proceeds
I hope that Whizzer don't fulfill his needs
Don't is wrong
Sing along
What was the noun?

I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down
I'll soon redecorate these stalls
I'd like some padding on the walls
And also pills
I wanna sleep
Sure, things'll probably worsen
But it's not like I'm some healthy person

I've rethought my talks with Marv
And one fact does emerge
I think I like his shrink
So that is why I might turn to drink
I'm on the brink

Of breaking down
I'm breaking down
Down, down
I only want to love a man who can love me....
Or like me...
Or help me...
Help me!

Marvin was never mine
He took his meetings in the boys' latrine
I used to cry
He'd make a scene
I'd rather die
Than dry-clean
Marvin's wedding gown

I'm breaking down
I'm breaking down
It's so upsetting when you've found
That what's rectangular is round
I mean it stinks
I mean he's queer
And me, I'm just a freak
Who needs it maybe every other week

I've rethought the fun we've had
And one fact does emerge:
I've played the foolish clown
The almost virgin who sing this dirge
Is on the verge

Of breaking down
I'm breaking down
Down, down
The only thing that's breaking up is my family
The only thing that's breaking up is my family
But me, I'm breaking down
