You're travelling going to places just to see wide open spaces
Head over heels try to be a wise man

They're telling you come on closer
But you're not the one who chose her
You're head over heels trying to be true man

And everything's just a bad word
When you don't know what you really want
And want is as sad as the bad word
You had it coming it's coming on strong

You've been young for so long
You've been so young for too long

If I call you you want answer
I don't know what to do but I'm
Head over heels trying to be rightous man

And everything's just a bad word
When you don't know what you really want
And want is as sad as the bad word
You had it comin on real strong

You've been young for so long
You've been so young for too long

You've been young for so long
You've been so young for too long

You've been young for so long
You've been so young for too long
