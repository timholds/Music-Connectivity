[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I'm just high, why they hatin' on me?
People tend to think all the drinks on me
I don't even have no money to spend
To buy patron for you and all your friends
Baby I be on my grind, rain sleet snow
Rollin' up good every place we go
Cause we tryin' to get high, get high, get high
Know the bullshit and all the problems, but we too gone to see
Little bit of this and a little bit of that
We proceed to give them what they need
Just wakin' up and gettin' stoned
Rub my eyes and check my phone
Open up the fridge to make some waffles
But no more syrup up in my bottle
Damn, but it's okay, I top it off with scrambled eggs
Aye gotta work with watcha got
Aye gotta work with watcha got

[Hook]
Supposed to be in class but I ain't going
And lets chill on the couch
See what's on the telly, girl we won't leave house
Can ya stay a while, can ya stay a while
Cause girl I'm feelin' lazy and I'm tryna hang around

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Ain't tryna get out of my bed till noon
Neighbors smell the perfume smoke in my room
And I got the door closed can't be sure though
Amsterdam weed, spendin' euro's
Get the herb rolled,let's relax
Take your shoes off and kick it back
We escaped the world, escaped the stress
But I don't give a fuck if the house a mess
Cause we gonna handle that later, we gonna handle that later
Right now lets get this paper and smile for all them haters
Aye cream cheese and a bagel, have a glass of milk and an eggo
I'm rockin' PJ's and no shirt, I smoke weed, eat yogurt
Haha, enjoy the best things in your life
Cause you ain't gonna get to live it twice
They say you waste time asleep, But I'm just tryin' to dream

[Hook]
