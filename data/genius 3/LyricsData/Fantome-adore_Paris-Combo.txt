CHORUS
Solar in the nighttime
Lunar at midday
You are my beloved ghost, my familiar vampire, I love it when you come to haunt me. I also love the soft rattle of your chains. It really thrills me...
I have known spirits, has-beens from Halloween, frights without
Frissons, nightmares that are nowhere near what you have shown me
Who were you when you were alive, I mean before?…No, don’t say, after all it doesn’t interest me. What I want now is you, adorable demon
CHORUS
You’ve got style - very "Baskerville" - from London to Barcelona you reign over the slums and, snuggled up in bed, I wait for you in Paris
And then you grumble when I call you "my angel", it bothers you, I tease you…I know that you are a dreadful monster, angry for no reason at all
CHORUS
