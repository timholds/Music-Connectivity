[Verse 1: Tha Joker]
I know you probably thought I forgot where I came from
Cause most of these niggas get rich and then they change up
My niggas think I changed
So many nights I contemplated this fame thing
It's so crazy, it's making life so complicated
When I'm wrong I'm wrong, when I'm right I'm wrong
That's what I get from their conversation
Niggas I love so much they feel jealousy and it's devastating
Just trying to be a consolation
My neighborhood was my congregation
But they lied on me like bitches
Bitch, you're supposed to be glad I made it
Wanna hear some real shit? Some times I hate this limelight
But the ones who left were never there, everything's clearer in hindsight
To the ones who hold it down, it don't get no bigger than
If you my nigga you my nigga then put me down
When I'm not around would they smile at me, when I'm there to see
But when I roll my weed it's plain to see that most of y'all my enemies

[Hook: Tha Joker]
I know you thought I probably forgot where I came from
But I can't, I can't
Cause most of these niggas get rich and then they change up
But I can't, I can't
I live my life by the code everyday on the road
I just want my niggas to know I ain't forgot about you
Thru all the lies that been told, niggas come and they go
Just want my niggas to know I ain't forgot about you

[Verse 2: Tito Lopez]
Out here on grindmode on a tight rope with a blindfold
Trying to get what I'm owed before I'm old
(I ain't forgot about you)
But I'm cold, when you hunt for treasure don't find gold
You could lose your mind or you could find your soul
(I ain't forgot about you)
And this that life shit
Spark one up then write shit
Ain't scared of death, but got a fear for failure
Like Rodney King, the fear of night stick
And it's in my eyes, big surprise
Everybody want me to take time to listen
It's like we always fucking one ho
Want me to come and go and take my position
But being successful a burden
And we the ones who get scorned for that
I wish I could take everybody with me
But I just can't, I ain't born for that
Sell out, nah, I ain't going for that
I know exactly who was there from the jump
I know exactly who the people is
That got me of the bridge when I was just finna jump
And I'mma ease their pain
Take some pressure off their brain
I want my mind to feel so high
Everytime she eat she on a airplane
I rep my hood so faithfully
But still some niggas wanna hate on me
But the way I see, shit is all cool
If I stopped now, I'd be a damn fool
You know

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Big K.R.I.T]
It's multi since '99, 300 since my conception
Put my team until the day I'm gone
I'll be damned if a nigga say I ain't repping
Days of balling at the wesley
Kick it on the porch, man we'll all get rich
OG's screaming "fuck the world"
Well shit you're bad Krit cause life's a bitch
Duck the chains inside better tapes of that maximum in the parking lot
For the five dollars, two a proper
Then they double bet like that shit was hot
Black but like that beast to knock, so I threw some bass on that track
Dixson told me "don't be scared to hide the man when you serving niggas that crack"
I swear all my niggas can rap, word, the Joy, Moe, Matt, oh lord
The Superman, Tears, Moe Dee, Drake, Willy B, Bruce, and Jay O
Flow star beats off the richter, crack I always been a real nigga
And shout out to Jay who can different coat, fat cat always kept it real with me
DJ Booth on the oness and two's, lego portion, cherry wave
Randy Vincent, flow un-tapered, and all my niggas that's in the grave
Cause we still pray that they soul saved
Open doors, catch a break, paved the way
Throw my M up like every day and that'll never change
