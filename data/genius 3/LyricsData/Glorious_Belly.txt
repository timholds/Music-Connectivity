[Chorus]
No sleep
I've been on tweak, 'bout to go re-up
All week
I've been all weak, this shit tore me up
Even if I die right now, it'd be glorious
Finally feel alive right now, and it's glorious (I do!)
No sleep
I've been on tweak, 'bout to go re-up
All week
I've been all weak, this shit tore me up
Even if I die right now, it'd be glorious
Finally feel alive right now, and it's glorious

[Verse 1]
I can't tell no lie, when I'm high, she's a story up
Look her in the eye, told her, "Fuck the world, it's only us"
Monday, pull up on you drunk, got me spilling guts
One day, I'll be what you need, I get what I want
Got your body talkin' out loud, and it's obvious
Four million people in this town, but it's only us
Some day, you won't let me down, just don't hold me up
Some way, I'ma hold you down, you my only one

[Chorus]
No sleep
I've been on tweak, 'bout to go re-up
All week
I've been all weak, this shit tore me up
Even if I die right now, it'd be glorious
Finally feel alive right now, and it's glorious (I do!)
No sleep
I've been on tweak, 'bout to go re-up
All week
I've been all weak, this shit tore me up
Even if I die right now, it'd be glorious
Finally feel alive right now, and it's glorious

[Verse 2]
OG, got me on a cloud, got me goin' up
Molly probably got me in my backseat, throwin' up
Codeine, got about a deuce, every double cup
Low key, we been getting juiced, for a fuckin' month
Even if we die right now, it'd be glorious
I'ma do it B.I.G., like Notorious, that's word to Puff
Four days in the same jeans, I ain't changin' up
No way, we been tweakin' hard, we been stayin' up

[Chorus]
No sleep
I've been on tweak, 'bout to go re-up
All week
I've been all weak, this shit tore me up
Even if I die right now, it'd be glorious
Finally feel alive right now, and it's glorious (I do!)
No sleep
I've been on tweak, 'bout to go re-up
All week
I've been all weak, this shit tore me up
Even if I die right now, it'd be glorious
Finally feel alive right now, and it's glorious
