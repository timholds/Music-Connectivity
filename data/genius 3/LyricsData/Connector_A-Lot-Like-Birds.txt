[Intro]
Go through solid stages not noticing me
Hands hold tightly
No one shares
Go through solid stages not noticing me
Hands hold tightly
No one shares

[Chorus]
Doll it up!
At the rate the paint is peeling off the wall
We'll need to cover it! (cover it!)
Before it all falls apart!
Oh, it'll all fall apart
Truss it up!
At the rate the skin is sloughing off our bones
They'll need to bury us. (bury us!)
Because we all fall apart
Yeah, we all fall apart

[Bridge]
The open mouths of these rooms are connected
By a hallway, dark and narrow
That we pass through like marrow through bone
And we do it alone

[Verse 1]
I miss the point and wish I still didn't dream
A taste gone mad, a sweet sadness, my favorite feeling
The whispering walls sound like an endless corridor
And at this rate, all the paint is peeling off the walls
And all I want to do is chase it (before it all falls apart)
Down the hall made out of frozen faces
Expressionless, eyes to the ground and lips locked tight
Ever so quiet, ever so quiet
And I never choose to taste hallucinations of what I've seen
Because I don't see the difference between chasing ghosts in dreams
And chasing dreams in life

[Chorus]
Doll it up!
All the ones still close to us
Are the ones that most of us
Still don't see. Still don't see the way
I would have thought that it could be the sympathetic solution
Disillusion
And if I stayed or left would you notice more or less of my existence?
Out of the corner of my eye
I see the ghost stutter-stepping like strobe lights
Ever-inching closer, but always out of reach
So I hold my breath and keep it under my tongue
And wait until both of my lungs are filled
If I count to ten, will it all go away?

[Bridge]
Brushed aside or pushed aside?
A difference in tension
Intention and force applied
Cast aside or passing by
People as canvases: blank outside and bleak inside
We learned (and it caused other things asunder)
To stay (and avoiding all the turmoil)
Out of the way of each other
Just stay out of the way!


Always colliding with the things that we had tried hard to avoid
We just bury them, close our eyes, cover it up
But what was buried managed to unlock the door
Even though we had boarded them, nailed them shut, hid the keys
Will we (in for it now) ever (board up the house) find happiness?!
Clarity?! Peace of mind?
Follow me down the hallway
If I should take a fall, don't look back
Pick a door
Any door
Any door!
NOW!

[Verse 2]
And now we sit in what was built on our dreams
A space, now sad, speaks madness, attempts concealing
The crumbling walls
It feels like our time is getting short
And it's too late cause all the paint is lying on the floor
Did we selfishly erase it? (And we have all ignored the fault.)
Busy filling mirrors with our damn faces?
Circling flaws that we find without respite
What do we find? What do we find?
And in the meantime
All the vultures circle us in hopes to feed
Because they don't see the difference between
Death disguised as life and life with lifeless eyes

[Chorus]
Doll it up!
All the ones still close to us
Are the ones that most of us still don't see the way
I would have thought that it could be the sympathetic solution
Disillusion
Because we all fall apart!
Oh, we all fall apart!
The open mouths close!
