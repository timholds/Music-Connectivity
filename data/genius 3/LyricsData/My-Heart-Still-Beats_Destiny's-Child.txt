You're holding me
I close my eyes
You're whispering
And I start to cry
You feel so good
So beautiful
For as long as you live
Don't let me go
Just hold me
Touch me
Feel me
As long as you love me
Reach for me
And need me
If you could trust me
And teach me
Never let go of me
Because you're half of me
My heart still beats
Looking in the eyes
The eyes of love
I hold your face
And I see the sun
And I taste your kiss
You touch my soul
I'm feeling things
I've never felt before
Just hold me
Touch me
Feel me
As long as you love me
Reach for me
And need me
If you could trust me
And teach me
Never let go of me
Because you're half for me
My heart still beats

I am feeling
What they call pure love
I never know
Feelings like this
Could exist
Inside of me
I'm soaring
Emotions exploding
I don't wanna live
Another day if you're
Not here with me
Just hold me
Touch me
Feel me
As long as you love me
Reach for me
And need me
If you could trust me
And teach me
Never let go of me
Because you're half of me
My heart still beats
Because you're half of me
My heart still beats
My heart still beats
