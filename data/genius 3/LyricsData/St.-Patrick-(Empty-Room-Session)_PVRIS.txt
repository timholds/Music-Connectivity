I know it's chemicals that make me cling to you
And I need a miracle to get away from you
I know it's chemicals
And I need a miracle
And I'm not spiritual
But please stay
'Cause I think you're a saint and I think you're an angel

I said
You give me something to talk about, something to talk about
I said
You give me something to think about that's not the shit in my head
You're a miracle
You're a miracle
A miracle

Transparent hands were at my neck
But I love the way you let me breathe instead
Take in your chemicals
You are a miracle
And I'm not spiritual
But please stay
'Cause you're a glimpse of bliss, a little taste of heaven

I said
You give me something to talk about, something to talk about
I said
You give me something to think about that's not the shit in my head
You're a miracle
You're a miracle
A miracle

I need a miracle to bring me back to you
I know you're gone now but I still wait for you
