[Chorus:]
I want you right here with me
If you really wanna be with me
Then come on, just stay with me
Cuz I really wanna get to know you

Oh, I want you right here with me
If you really wanna be with me
Then come on and stay with me
Come on and stay with me

Look at me girl, I can't believe
This feeling is more than a crush on you
And I can tell by the way you smile
You feel the same and we're both more than friends

If you want it then baby tell me so
Why don't you tell me, baby
Can't be afraid of love gotta let it show
Why don't you let your feelings show

It'll be our little secret no one has to know
We can keep it on the down low, baby
We can take it fast, or do you like it nice and slow
I need you by my side

[Chorus:]
Can you tell in my eyes
The happiness when you are in my heart
The joy you bring makes me wanna sing
I love you and you mean the world to me

If you want it then baby tell me so
Why don't you tell me, baby
Candle fade, of love gotta let it show
Why don't you let your feelings show

It'll be our little secret no one has to know
We can keep it on the down low, baby
We can take it fast, or do you like it nice and slow
I need you by my side

[Chorus 2x]
It's not hard girl, to tell that I'm
So in love with you, baby
And I know you feel what I feel cuz when
We're together it feels so right
So stay with me

[Repeat Chorus until fade]
