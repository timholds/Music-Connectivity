[Kendrick Lamar]
Y'all all want money, all y'all want from me
Y'all wanna die in the shade of things
We all gon' die, embrace the thing
Step aside
Watch me do my shit

[Kendrick Lamar]
Cops on the radar (god to me)
Cops on the radar (god to me)
God to me
God to me
God to me

[Vince Staples]
They don't wanna see me gettin' to the check
They just wanna see me swimmin' in the door
Don't drown on ground, ones to ya' head
911, freeze, (pop, pop), you're dead

[Kendrick Lamar]
Cops on the radar (god to me)
Now you wanna play war (god to me)
Cops on the radar (god to me)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Scarface, Scarface, y'all face more defeat
I know it hurts...
