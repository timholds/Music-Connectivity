[Intro: Lil Tin]
In today's news, hip hop recording artist
Kasland said to hang up the mic
After the release of his debut album, Devil's Delight
Sources say that he will be checking himself into a mental
Institution to help rid him of his, quote unquote, demons
It is unsure as to if Kasland will be returning
After this album. Will he ever be sane? Who knows

[Kasland]
I feel like... like everybody hates me
I lost everyone, and everything I've ever cared about
It seems like I'm stuck in the shadows
And I don't know how to get out
And I don't even know what I'm doing with this shit anymore

[Verse 1]
Step back a minute Imma kill it, real shit
Let the rhythm flow don't conceal it, feel it
Still that same rapper that nobody wants to deal with
Never passed the torch down in my label man it's still lit
Steal it? No one will ever get a chance to
I tried to go on tour, but I just kept on getting canceled
Would I ever sign a major deal? Hmm... depends who
Not too many people like the crazy shit fans do
Drawing my machete for the first time in years
This shit is getting heavy and it hurts lighter ears
People can't take in the pain and that's the worst side of peers
And I'm shanking all you bitches at the first sight of tears
Man up! Do you even know the shit I've been through
A lonely life and broken heart and no one to attend to
The comfort that I needed what the hell did I get into
The shits I used to give had me running to the men's room

[Hook]
Time to wake up, don't sleep on me now
Don't be sleeping on me now, don't be sleeping on me now
Got to get back to work, got to try to advance
I said to wake up, don't sleep on me now
Don't be sleeping on me now, don't be sleeping on me now
Got to get back on the saddle this may be my last chance

[Verse 2]
People hear about me say they want to know my story uh
Listen to my music hear a tale about a warrior
There's been a lot of blood and it's about to get gorier
Stronger than before and back to fucking with Victoria
Did you miss me? Well neither did I
When I said that I could be a fucking leader I lied
Cause I could blow at any second I have a fever inside
And I do the shit I do because I'm eager to die
Oh wait I'm sorry I forgot you don't like that
What would make someone like me think to write that
Came close a few times, but my demons seem to fight back
Can't get away and they won't let me wave the white flag
So here I am once again, locked up what's it been
A couple years of hustling and no one makes a fuss of it
My heart is gone and mind is lost, my soul is what I must defend
And see to it that in the end the devil in me doesn't win

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
2k11 did an EP thought I ripped it
Didn't blow up, but the sales were terrific
2k12 man I said it would be different
Then all I did was mess around and lose my best friend
2k13 I'm mentally intact
Now I bust my fucking ass to put my name on the map
2k14 I'm telling y'all that
Y'all prepare yourselves for the wrath, real rap
Think that this is what you're messing with? nah, hear the rest of it
First time I did a thing without second guessing it
Pouring out my heart, telling stories, and confessing shit
Going through this hell has turned my ass into a pessimist
Lighten up Kas, things will get better
Just pop another pill if you feel under the weather
Your friends will forgive you, if they don't, let them go
After all you got me, your best friend, let them know

[Hook]
