The sun’s just gone and the day grows quiet
I’ve got a light
You can’t see
On the inside
The city lights are sparkling
With airplanes taking off
Like bits of city floating off

And I’m afraid it’ll take my life
Some sacred part of me
Just to let it
Turn again to morning

[Chorus:]
The animal that flies
Is the darkest part of the sky
The animal that dives
Deep under the ocean
Carries its own light

Every time that I arrive
And I think to stay
Something moves
I lose my way
And I’m looking for the window
I find nothing but wall
I hang a picture
Of what I’m after
And all the red points of light
In my little life
Are blinking at me
Who will answer?

[Chorus]

I see nothing
Do you feel a warm jet?
I barely can
This is no rescue
I understand
I’ve made a mess again
Do you feel it happening?
I think I can

The sun’s just gone and the day grows quiet
I’ve got a light
You might see
On the inside
The city lights are sparkling
With airplanes taking off
Like bits of city floating off

Just when I think it’s too late
Like some final hour
The earth rolls over
And brings light to new ground
