[Verse 1]
Time to wake up, according to this alarm
Tell me this is a joke, I fell asleep minutes ago
Or so it feels; or for real
Cause lately, I've been greeting sunrise with a good night
That was 6:00, it's 6:05
Musta' passed out in the midst of a head rush; my bed just encapsulated me
Had a dream I was dating Zoe Kravitz, and I let her kiss 26 times; A-to-Z
I would say hooray for me, but I've not seen my dream come true
Therefore, begrudgingly, I trudge out of these sheets and move

[Hook]
Crawling through the day
Floating through the night
Wary of the shade
Carry me to light

Crawling through the day
Floating through the night
Wary of the shade
Carry me to light, I'm just

Crawling through the day
Floating through the night
Wary of the shade
Carry me to light, I'm just

Crawling through the day
Floating through the night
Wary of the shade...

[Verse 2]
Although to be fair, I could spare a snooze or two
Do not try to infiltrate, or I will have to Kruger you
Don't sleep on me, y'all
I came a long way from a long-faced teen with a dream and a blog...
Zoloft; no chill and an uncanny skill at putting sheen on my fog
I made my sadness special; not to you, but to me
Out that window of opportunity, my view wasn't seen
Foresight; this pain'll have it's pay off
So I cannot take a day off, now to leave and start this day off

[Hook]
