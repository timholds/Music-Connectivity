[Hook]
Heavy is the head...
Heavy is the head...
Heavy is the head...
Heavy is the head...
I shoot straight like an archer
Ruler of my time, I'm King Arthur

[Verse 1: N8]
Feel like I'm back from the dead
You can't knock me down
You can't stop me now
You think I'm cocky? Well...
You're probably right
Music to me is what meth is to Walter White
It's all my life, so I live by it
Fueled by the dream that one day people will buy it
I'm still biased, thinkin' I am sick
But who's to say I'm not, watch
I will rise to it, rise to the occasion
Whether it's the lyrics I am sayin'
Or through the guitar that I am playin'
I'll be famous, the rest will hate it
But fame ain't the destination
Music is my resting place
I came to lay my head on pillow cases
Of melodies and heavy basses
On a daily basis my brain displays it contains the ways of attaining greatness
But the guy you see is only half the man I strive to be
Finally got a girl by my side and she's a nine at least
I had to get myself a beauty because I'm a beast
And she knows I'm going places
She says "Follow my dreams, dont be patient, go and chase 'em"
That's what I did, now I'm so close to greatness...
Im so close to greatness I can almost taste it

Heavy is the head...
Heavy is the head...
Heavy is the head...
Heavy is the head...
I shoot straight like an archer
Ruler of my time, I'm King Arthur

[Verse 2: Alex Lagos]
Feel like I'm sittin' horseback
Fire in my eyes until they turn to scorched black
Horizon full of armies, but I never show fear
Pulled the sword out the stone, I know I belong here
I was meant for the battle, born for the castle
Two-faced enemies, I call em Eddie Haskell
Wind through my hair, I can smell the future comin'
Heart poundin', think it's Andre, feel it drummin'
I got dragons at my back, I'm not afraid to fly
Put my faith in powers bigger than myself so if I die
I will not be lost...I will not be lost
I'm feelin colder than the morning frost
Right to the throne sittin' at my round table
I will write my name in legends, you will hear of me in fable
There's a chill that shakes bones every time my name is mentioned
But they'll never pay me dividends if they don't pay attention
So let 'em know I got it, put the kingdom on my back
I will not lose myself, I put everything on that
I'm feelin' like I'm risin' and I'm never coming down
But heavy is the head that bears the crown

[Hook: Alex Lagos and N8]
Heavy is the head...
Heavy is the head...
Heavy is the head...
Heavy is the head...
I shoot straight like an archer
Ruler of my time, I'm King Arthur
