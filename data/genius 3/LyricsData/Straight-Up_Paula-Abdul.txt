[Verse 1]
Lost in a dream
I don't know which way to go
(A-let me say it now)
If you are all that you seem
Then, baby, I'm movin' way too slow

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love caught
In the slammin' door
How about some information, please?

[Chorus]
Straight up now, tell me
Do you really wanna love me forever (oh, oh, oh)
Or am I caught in a hit-and-run?
Straight up now, tell me
Is it gonna be you and me together (oh, oh, oh)
Or are you just havin' fun?

[Verse 2]
Time's standing still
Waiting for some small clue
(A-let me tell ya now)
I keep getting chills
When I think your love is true

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge]
You are so hard to read
You play hide-and-seek
With your true intentions
If you're only playin' games
I'll just have to say
Abb-b-b-bye, b-b-b-bye

[Breakdown]
Do, do you love me?
(Do, do you love me, baby?)
Do, do you love me?
(Do, do you love me? A-hey, baby!)
Do, do you love me?
(Do, do you love me, baby?)
C'mon now, do, do you love me?
(Do, do you love me?)
A-tell me, baby

[Pre-Chorus - Extended]
I've been a fool before
Wouldn't like to get my love
Caught in the slammin' door
Are you more than hot for me
Or am I a page in your history book?
I don't mean to make demands
But the word and the deed go hand in hand
How about some information, please?

[Chorus]
