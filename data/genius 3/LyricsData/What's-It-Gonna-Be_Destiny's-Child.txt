[Verse 1]
Hey you what's the deal?
It's poppin' up in here
Wanna have a good time, just tryna chill
When I couldn't help but notice how you starin' at me
Oh, baby you're so fine
You deserve my time
With your sexy eyes, you're qualified
So boy, why don't cha
Baby, why won't cha
Come and talk to me?

[Refrain 1]
(Ohhh) I wanna get closer
(Ohhh) Baby let me show ya
(Ohhh) I see you comin' over
Makin' your move, I'm waitin' on you to
(Ohhh) Tell me what I wanna hear
(Ohhh) Whisper something in my ear
(Ohhh) Boy you're makin' me feel sexy
Baby we can get up outta here

[Chorus]
(What's it gonna be boy?)
I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me
(What's it gonna be boy?)
Can't you feel this chemistry?
(What's it gonna be boy?)
It's so damn crowded, we should leave
(What's it gonna be boy?)
Tell me what's it gonna be

[Verse 2]
Can we take it there?
Club is about to close
Gimme one more dance and I'm ready to go
And the DJ's playin' all the same songs
And the night is about to end
Can we meet in the parkin' lot?
Find a quiet place where we can talk
To find out more about each other
Baby can we?

[Refrain 2]
(Oh) I wanna get closer
(Oh) Baby let me show ya
(Oh) Now that you came over, made your move
Now tell me what you wanna do
(Ohhh) Tell me what I wanna hear
(Ohhh) Whisper something in my ear
(Ohhh) Your makin' me feel so sexy
Baby we should get up outta here

[Chorus 2]
(What's it gonna be boy?)
I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me

Can't you feel this chemistry?
(What's it gonna be boy?)
This place is crowded we should leave
(What's it gonna be boy?)
Tell me what's it gonna be

[Bridge]
You know I'm feeling you tonight (I'm feeling you)
So let's find another spot to go (You feeling me)
So we can get to know each other better
I'll go and tell my girls (I'll tell my girls)
And you go and tell your boys (Go tell your boys)
That we gonna be leavin'
Tell me what's it gonna be

You know I'm feeling you tonight (I'm feeling you)
So let's find another spot to go (You feeling me)
And baby we can leave here together (Baby can we leave?)

If you go and tell your boys

Tell me what's it gonna be

[Chorus 3]
(What's it gonna be boy?)
I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me

Can't you feel this chemistry?

It's so damn crowded, we should leave
(What's it gonna be boy?)
Tell me what's it gonna be

I'm watchin' you, you watchin' me
What's it gonna be boy?
What's it gonna be boy?
What's it gonna be boy?
