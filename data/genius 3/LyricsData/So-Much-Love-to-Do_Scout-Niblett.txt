My baby, all I know
I could die from never letting go
Don't doubt, momma's coming to ya
Her dreams have never felt nearer

It's coming after me
'Cause I'm coming after you
Ah, there's so much love to do

That desire to make things better
Even from your heartbreaker
Your momma sings a pretty tune
Gives it love and sends it to you

It's coming after me
'Cause I'm comin' after you
Ah, there's so much love to do

Peachy peach
There's never enough kissing
All alone, that's not a nice feeling
And that desire to make things better
Even from your heartbreaker

It's coming after me
So I'm coming after you
There's so much love
There's so much love
To do
