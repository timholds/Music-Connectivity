Into a dream, i took a turn, an' promised t' return
Th' way we were, th' way we met, th' way i lit yr cigarette
Th' way it trailed, into a stream, an' lay down between...

You had t' choose, a side t' love, an' divide yerself in two
Th' way you were, long before, you were a walkin' civil war
But you forget, where th' road goes, an' tonite it shows...

Into yr soul, i tried t' climb, but found th' hole t' high
For me t' leave, th' way i'd learned, an' found i couldn't turn
Th' way th' trees, an' fallin' rain, remind me in a way...

Th' way you were, th' day we met, th' way i lit your cigarette
Th' way it changed, into a strange, cole porter phrase
But you forget, how th' song goes, an' tonite it shows...
