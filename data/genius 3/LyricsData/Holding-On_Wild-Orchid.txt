They say patience is a virtue
But I've been waiting too long
I believed in your promises
And, It hurts to see I was wrong
The ' One-more-try's
The sleepless nights
These countless tears that I've cried

Why should I...

Keep holding on
When we are going no where
When I knew some 1 new
Is holding you
Why should I
Keep holding on
Why, why keep holding on
Gotta let go coz
Love's already gone

Stairways leading down to no where
Roads that never end
Why keep on going round in circles?
To break my heart again
Caressed my hand
And left me there alone
But you don't care...

Why should I....
Keep holding on
When we are going no where
When I knew some 1 new
Is holding you
Why should I
Keep holding on
Why, why keep holding on
Gotta let go coz
Love's already gone

I used to think that I should blame myself
But it wasn't me who was seeing someone else
It isn't me you've never seen before
As you watching me walk right out this door

Keep holding on
When we are going no where
When I knew some 1 new
Is holding you
Why should I
Keep holding on
Why, why keep holding on
Gotta let go coz
Love's already gone

Tell me why do I keep holding on, keep holding on, when love is gone

Keep holding on
When we are going no where
When I knew some 1 new
Is holding you
Why should I
Keep holding on
Why, why keep holding on
Gotta let go coz
Love's already gone
