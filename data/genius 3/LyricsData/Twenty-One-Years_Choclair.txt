[Sample]
21 years of my lifetime

[Intro]
Yeah, 21 years
Choclair's in the house (21 years in my lifetime)
Ill B
Uh (like that)
You need to recognize, what you had is lies

[Verse 1]
21 years of pure bullshit
It makes me wanna bang my head on the walls
And do some shit like all straight swarms in the malls
Mentality, it's not where it should be
When you see red and white lights break the night skies
Reflection of a mad man in the tear down
Now that another brother dies, another in handcuffs
Mothers knees start to buckle up and fall
When they see their child outlined in chalk
Silence broken by shots or screams from knives cuttin through your flesh
Cold Steel interrupting blood streams
The pawns are grim, but they froze if do it right
Or bring your luxury, man for real
It makes me wanna run that drug deal
I'm sick of all this loose change, pennies, nickels, and dimes
My pocket wants the bills, every day flat meals
Fuck this lifetime, struggle and needs, stretchin dollars like a pack of Ramseys
It's hard to concieve
That you can be something when you had nothing
Frontin just to be down, but only gettin clowned by the peers
That why fights happened at Nathan's Square every year
Understand I
Never seen my dad since grade 9
Maybe years before or after I don't know, but I know that time flies
So I just rely on my family, my mother and brothers
And my boys is the first before these others
I try to stay strong through the hard times and tough times
My heart dies every time my mom cries
21 years of my life time

[Hook] (sample throughout)
All my life I kept my eyes on the prize
But every time I reached for the prize it demised
I wonder what's wrong, but I gots to move on
I gotta keep my head and I gotta stay strong
All my life I kept my eyes on the prize
But every time I reached for the prize it demised
I wonder what's wrong, but I gots to move on
So I gotta keep my head and I gotta stay strong

[Verse 2]
I look up in the air to see the blue skies but grey clouds
They always came, and always rained
Leavin on my face tear stains
I try to cover the worry and sad
Sittin down, reminiscent of my dad
And shit we never had
And G's for some lead
I repeat it to my boys cause I love you all truly
But people nowadays, they be acting unruly
So I live for now without forgettin the past
Cause I never know what time's left in my life glass
I surpassed the odds
Not coming home in bullet wounds or in some squad cars
But what the fuck, is this the repetoire
We all went to war, 45 non-stressed
Screwdrivers in the car, situation's deep
Juveniles influenced by veterans up in the street biz
Now they street kids
Addicted to the game, unmarked cars and plain clothes roaming the terrain
(In front of club, blood stains)
A mark of an assassin
Livin up and no wage, but all the latest fashion
Custom made links and shit teases my pysche
Now could this be, out of poverty
Is this where fate wanted me to be
My thoughts out of control
Leavin stress on my mind (oh)
The point of high toll
All my Richmond niggas know the steelo
21 years down

[Hook] (sample throughout)
21 years I kept my eyes on the prize
But every time I reached for the prize it demised
I wonder what's wrong, but I gots to move on
I gotta keep my head and I gotta stay strong
21 years I kept my eyes on the prize
But every time I reached for the prize it demised
I wonder what's wrong, but I gots to move on
So I gotta keep my head and I gotta stay strong

[Verse 3]
I walk into the future on a narrow path
But every step I take it gives me flashbacks upon the past
Like the part I got stabbed
And guns to my brain, man this life is insane
Sometimes I wish I was an addict to Novacane
Just leave the pain away, fade away, take my soul away
To see another day
Dwellin upstairs with my grandma and grandpa
Causes my heart racin like I would be testin stamina
And everywhere I look I see the white picket fences
But reality, had only seen my boys gettin sentenced
That's what I'm seein all around
So fuck the picket fences, all I see is elevators broken down
But discouraged, nah!
I know where I wanna be
Just smilin, strong like the island
Cruisin on the ave in the black Cad
With the Day's on sound quest
Or the prodigy minus DJs and the H-I-double L-T
O-to-the-P
Understand me
Parents leave they childs stranded
So they grew up into bein bandits
I can't manifest
Richmond Crew, all paranormal, to all my peoples God bless
