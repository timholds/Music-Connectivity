Lookin' back on the track for a little green bag
Got to find just the kind or I'm losin' my mind

Out of sight in the night out of sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track gonna do it my way

Out of sight in the night out of sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track gonna do it my way

Lookin' back

Lookin' for some happiness
But there is only loneliness to find
Jump to the left, turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs, lookin' behind!

Lookin' for some happiness
But there is only loneliness to find
Jump to the left, turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs, lookin' behind, yeah!

Lookin' back on the track for a little green bag
Got to find just the kind or I'm losin' my mind

Out of sight in the night out of sight in the day
Lookin' back on the track gonna do it my way

Lookin' back on the track for a little little green bag
Got to find just the kind or I'm losin' my mind

Alright

Lookin' for some happiness
But there is only loneliness to find
Jump to the left, turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs, lookin' behind

Lookin' for some happiness
But there is only loneliness to find
Jump to the left, turn to the right
Lookin' upstairs, lookin' behind

Pa pa pa pa pa pa....
