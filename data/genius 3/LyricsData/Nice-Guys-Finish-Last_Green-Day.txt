[Verse 1]
Nice guys finish last
You're running out of gas
Your sympathy will get you left behind
Sometimes you're at your best
When you feel the worst
Do you feel washed up, like piss going down the drain?

[Pre-Chorus]
Pressure cooker, pick my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have its truth but now the joke's on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy

[Chorus]
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine

[Verse 2]
Living on command
You're shaking lots of hands
You're kissing up and bleeding all your trust
Taking what you need
Bite the hand that feeds
You lose your memory and you got no shame

[Pre-Chorus]
Pressure cooker, pick my brain and tell me I'm insane
I'm so fucking happy I could cry
Every joke can have its truth but now the joke's on you
I never knew you were such a funny guy

[Chorus]
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine
Oh, nice guys finish last
When you are the outcast
Don't pat yourself on the back
You might break your spine
