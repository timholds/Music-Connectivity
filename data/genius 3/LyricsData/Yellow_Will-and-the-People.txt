Stupid guy
The bastard got me high for the first time
And time flew by
And here I am
I caught this disease
Like you wouldn't believe
And no one's coming to relieve me of this stupid plan
So children please beware
The boogie man is waiting over there
He stopped me as I tried to run on by
And now my teeth are going yellow
Cause I'm a stupid fellow
My teeth are going yellow
We're all the same
If you shoot before you aim
You sit and think for way too long
And slap your head at what you said
Because it all went wrong
But on the other hand
Times come you need someone who understands
Makes you think deep about your master plan
Only then you feel at home
Children please beware
The boogie man is waiting over there
He stopped me as I tried to run on by
And now my teeth are going yellow
Cause I'm a stupid fellow
My teeth are going yellow
I want it to STOP
I'm going yellow and yellow and yellow an again
And I want it to STOP
Cause I'm getting yellow and yellow and yellow an again
And getting yellower, yellower, STOP
And I want it to STOP
Cause I'm getting yellow and yellow and yellow
And getting yellower, yellower, STOP
Children please beware
The boogie man is waiting over there
He stopped me as I tried to run on by
And now my teeth are going yellow
Cause I'm a stupid fellow
My teeth are going yellow
Yellow, yellow, yellow
My teeth are going yellow
