[Pre-Chorus]
I can't get enough of you, baby
I can't get enough of you, baby
Yes, it's true
Baby, yes, it's true

[Chorus]
Whenever we kiss
I get to feeling like this
I get to wishing that there was two of you

[Verse 1]
My heart cries out
Woo, baby
It feels so nice
I want your arms to wrap around me twice

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough of you baby
Right or wrong
Baby, right or wrong

[Bridge]
When you had to go
I hated the thought
I always wish the night was twice as long

[Verse 2]
My heart cries out more, baby
I love you so much
I wish that there was more of you to touch

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't get enough of you baby
I can't get enough of you baby
Right or wrong
Baby, right or wrong

[Bridge]
When you had to go
I hated the thought
I always wish the night was twice as long

[Outro]
I can't get enough of you, baby
Can't get enough of you, baby
I can't get enough of you, baby
Can't get enough of you, baby
I can't get enough of you, baby
Can't get enough of you, baby
I can't get enough of you, baby
Can't get enough of you, baby
I can't get enough of you, baby
