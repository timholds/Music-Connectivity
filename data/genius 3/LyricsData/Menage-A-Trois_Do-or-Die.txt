(Contains samples of lady moaning, speaking spanish)

(Verse 1, AK)
She had a different faith, different stroke
And she like to get poked in the throat
Like to watch her in slow mo'
It was like whoa, it was like whoa
It was like

(Belo)
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
You didn't know?
Know, know, know, know

(AK)
She even said I had cold game
Emphasize on the way I put the pain and the thang on her
Or maybe it's the way that I came on her
She put it on her mama, that a nigga could get a menage a trois
So I called up who?
(Belo)
Who? Who? Who? Who?
(N.A.R.D)

Just too weak, I had my condom fall (You had your condom fall?)
Yeah dogg, yeah dogg

Is she in the car? Meet me at the bar
Menage a trois, trois
Menage a trois, trois, trois
Menage a trois, trois, trois

(N.A.R.D)
Sittin' at the bar
With two sets of twins
Just hopped up outta the Benz
My fur up off in the wind
Don't deal wit' nothin' but ten's
Gotta pimp this broad again
Gotta play these cards again
Now look who just walked in
AK, (What's up?) Belo

(Belo)
What's up, up, up, up
What's up, up, up, up

(N.A.R.D)

She like to fuck
And her, in the butt
And her, whatever the fuck
Gobble the dick
And swallow the nut

Can't spend that
Double back
Ain't with that
See my nigga split cats

Meet me at the pool, let's chit-chat
Where JP at?

Get yo ass off the block
Get yo ass off the block

Loosen' them thongs, and tie her up
Get the brains, and fire the bud
But that's after we all done fucked
