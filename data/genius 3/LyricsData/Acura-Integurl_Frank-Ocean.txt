[Verse 1]
She singing bitch I'm paid, that's all I gotta say, I'm like who knew?
That after all the years I'd make a Weezy fan out of you too
When I met you, you were Thom Yorke, Chris Martin and U2
When you met me I was Three 6, Pimp C, Bun B, 8-Ball and MJG, yeah

[Bridge]
But we're both a long way from home
We got the windows down, the radio's on, always

[Hook]
I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me?
Cause you know you're my baby, you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the pride, in it for the ride, yeah

[Verse 2]
You said one day I'll start up my car and it'll explode
Well now that's the last time I'm letting you watch Casino alone
You hate when I leave you in the motel and hunt for jobs
So now I let you drive and wait outside in the parking lot

[Bridge]
I know we're both a long way from home
Just keep the windows down and radio's on, always

[Hook]
I wrote a letter to the sky saying maybe one day you'll get to kiss me
My girl found it in the car and said baby why you trying to diss me?
Don't you know you're my baby, don't you know you're my baby, ooh
I'm not just in it for the ride, in it for the ride, yeah

[Verse 3]
You'll live a better life
A better life you'll know
A dull life ain't nothing
Don't speak put your car in drive and
No Benz can make you friends, she don't care what car I'm driving
No Bentley can kiss me back
