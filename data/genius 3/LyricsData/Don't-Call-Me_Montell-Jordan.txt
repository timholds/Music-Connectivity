1 - Don't you call me no more
'Cuz I'm missing you too much
Lying down next to my girl
But I'm longing for your touch
In my mind I'm wrong and I know
That I need to let you go
Don't call me...no more

I had a moment of weakness
Trying to prove I had game
I didn't say I had a woman at home
When you give me your number and name

We agreed we will call each other
But never, ever try to see one another
Now I'm thinking unfaithfully
Cuz you voice is killing me, so

Repeat 1

Oh, it's temporary insanity
Every time I hear the sound
Of your voice on my telephone
Realizing you're breaking me down
Now we're saying that we both gotta have it
But getting caught is a really bad habit
And I don't want to get accustomed to
This feeling of lust for you

When she calls me (I can't tell nobody)
Whispering softly (In my ear)
That she wants me (She wants my body)
More than I've ever known (Wants to pull me near)
I'll just tell her (That I gotta let her go)
That it's over (Gotta go, gotta go)
Though I want her (She gotta go)
She must go, don't you call me no more

Repeat 1

When she calls me (I can't tell nobody)
Whispering softly (In my ear)
That she wants me (She wants my body)
More than I've ever known (Wants to pull me near)
I'll just tell her (That I gotta let her go)
That it's over (Gotta go, gotta go)
Though I want her (She gotta go)
She must go, don't you call me no more

Repeat 1 until fade
