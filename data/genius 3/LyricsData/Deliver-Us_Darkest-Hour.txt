[Verse 1]
This world is dying everyday
Don't let it come between us
Our fate has traveled this far
And now the storm brings us faster to a close
Brimming with pathetic prose

[Pre-Chorus]
Vacate your stolen hearts
As if nobody's seen us
And empty out your pockets
You needn't bring
Anything where we're going

[Chorus]
And to think we created this monster
Crawling in and walking out on us
To think that we craft our own disasters
Falling in and falling out of hope

[Verse 2]
Don't leave me, I need this
Unleashed and unafraid, us castaways
Calling out release us, propelling towards
Insidious decay at an alarming rate

[Pre-Chorus]
Vacate your stolen hearts
As if nobody's seen us
And empty out your pockets
You needn't bring
Anything where we're going

[Chorus]
And to think we created this monster
Crawling in and walking out on us
To think that we craft our own disasters
Falling in and falling out of hope

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And to think we created this monster
Crawling in and walking out on us
To think that we craft our own disasters
Falling in and falling out of hope

[Outro]
Don't leave me, give me release
Don't sink down into defeat
Only when you're through fleeing
Can you save yourself? Deliver us
