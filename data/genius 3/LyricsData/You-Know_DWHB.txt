[Chorus]
You know we're about to get it right
Yeah, bring it right back
Hey, now tell me do you like that

[Verse 1: Travis]
Summer breeze rustling up under leaves
Summer heat, hotter than the lead on Weeds
Got that milk and cream and it's fresh just like an udder squeezed
What's the record now? Are we three for three?
True Facts and Dog Park and Bulk Spices
Four years, three classics, and we even got degrees
Flow frittata, you got a lot of nerve trying not to
Act suspicious, you're wishy-washy like bad moscato
Holy moly, your goalie's holding the hot potato
Your buzz is dying, your buzz is dying, I need a swatter
Flies caught in a honey trap, this honey rap an easy swallow
Soulful, but it's creeping up, relentless like the thing that follows

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Cheldon McQueen]
I'm back spitting, the track sitting so acidic
Should I kill these niggas? Hold up, let me ask Siri
Aye yo Siri should I kill these niggas?
"I'm afraid I don't know what you should do."
And I know they try to pull me down the higher I go
That's why these rappers always talking just to hide what they stole
And society never side with me, it's a sign I know
When they like adi adi ah, I be like adi adi oh
I'm back spitting, the track sentenced, it's god-given
This is Kool-Aid sipping mixed with hard living
It's the most consistent
I was out there writing rhymes while y'all was roller-rinking
Underpaid, underrated still overthinking
Over and uh
I'm a overlord
Oh boy
So please excuse if we pull up with them toys
Like what's up?
Like what's up?

[Bridge: Andrew]
Try to tell them, but they don't know
And they don't give a fuck about nothing but their own, so
Wave goodbye and we keep riding, yeah

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Andrew]
Please excuse the too crude nature of my musings
Natural how it comes with the paper and the music
Harmony and rhythm is the language of my choosing
Three bar loop, so I pray it ain't confusing
Ain’t about the numbers, how you shape it and you use it
It's right there, yours for the taking and the shoosting
Fluids in your system cease a flowing when we spit it
Do it till it’s over, never quit before it’s finished
Hit up Luby’s for a Luanne and some jello to replenish
Get a pizza later, just the white sauce and the spinach
Got gelato with the lowest air by mass percentage
Food comatose, to the east I shall diminish
I dreamed a dream of things unseen
By any living man or beast
I couldn’t tell you what it means
But it don’t matter in the long run anyway
Probably something stupid, like the manifestation
Of my subconscious desires to see a sequel to A Bug's Life
Probably say “Hey man, that’s the drugs, right?”
Yeah, let me tell you how this Ibuprofen fucks me up
The Tylenol is crazy, help me break it down and cut it up
Mix it with a glass of milk and pour it in a double cup
Hit it with some Hershey's syrup if you’re really tough enough
And that’s a toddy woddy, baby boy, don’t worry, slurp it up

[Chorus]

[Outro: Andrew]
Oh no
We out here, and you know we're about to get it right

I feel it
Oh, oh, I feel it
Oh, you know I'm floating away
And if you feel it
Don't try to conceal it
Own it, you're the realest
Oh, you know what real is
The secret
Yeah, we know the secret
Oh, you know we tuck it away
We know you need it
Don't try to conceal it
Just a little feeling
Flowing like it's breathing
The spices
First you add the spices
Sprinkle them on top of the plate
You know they're needed
Don't try to conceal it
Own it, they're the reason
Know you love the seasoning
