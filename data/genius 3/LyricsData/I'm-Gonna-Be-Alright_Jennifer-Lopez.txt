Oh yes.....
[Verse 1]
It's funny because for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside I could hear voices telling me this isn't right
Don't you know it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
Because I love you
I just tried to stay

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And I know inside I'm going to be alright
I said I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm going to be alright

[Verse 2]
Friends of mine say to me
They say you got control over me
You're not alone
I played a part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And I know inside I'm going to be alright
I said I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm going to be alright

[Bridge]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Some days I want to stay
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay
Never thought it would be true
Me living without you
But now it's time for me to make a move

[Chorus]
I used to say I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And I know inside I'm going to be alright
I said I couldn't do it
But I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes
I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm going to be alright
Oh no...
Be alright...
Says I'Â´m gonna be alright
