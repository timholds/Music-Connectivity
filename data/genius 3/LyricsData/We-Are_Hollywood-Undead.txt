[Chorus: Danny]
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts!
We are, we are, we are broken from the start!
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark!
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts!

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
If you can lose it all, then welcome to Broadway
Silicone dreams and your name on the Marquee
And I can hold it up but I hold it up hardly
It's hotter here in hell but it's getting real dark, see?
So all you sick and the bitterness of the lonely
To all you overdosed and you miles of coke fiends
'Cause every step, another step, you're walking on my dreams
'Cause every breath, another breath, you're breathing when I breathe
I watched 'em all come, gotta watch the rest go
I'm married to the devil in the city of angels
So come, all you wicked, to the world of the empty
You know I need it all, so baby, don't tempt me
I'm knocking on your door, nope, nobody sent me
Just checking all you bitches like I'm checking this check sheet
So put your hats on, Lohner, don't get soft
You can see God when I take my mask off

[Chorus: Danny]
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts!
We are, we are, we are broken from the start!
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark!
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts!

[Verse 2: J-Dog]
The fame is your best friend, you love it, no questions
Beating down the door is the face of rejection
And once again, it's a tragedy anthem
We never wanted more, we never needed your blessing
Who could give a fuck about a kid with a dream?
'Cause stories aren't told about the ones unseen
With a gleam in his eye, his middle finger to the sky
Crooked smile on his face, he doesn't think he can die
So grab a pick and an axe 'cause we try, we cry
Into the bottle of Jack, then we die inside
So when you look in his eyes, what you see now?
Murder the monster you've made then watch him bleed out
We're in a life where it's kill or lose
Just lie, motherfucker, till you hear the truth
From the under the street, through the gutters of youth
Just cry, motherfucker, yeah, I'm talking to you

[Chorus: Danny]
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts!
We are, we are, we are broken from the start!
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark!
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts!

[Bridge: J-Dog]
From the city of angels!
An empty vessel of devils!
Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes see the world that you gave us!
From the city of angels!
An empty vessel of devils!
Is there no one to save us?
Look through my eyes see the world that you gave us!

[Chorus: Danny]
We are, we are, we are made from broken parts!
We are, we are, we are broken from the start!
And our hearts, our hearts, they were beating in the dark!
'Cause we are, we are, we are built from broken parts!

[Outro: J-Dog]
From the city of angels!
An empty vessel of devils!
Is there no one to save us?
Through my eyes see the world that you gave us!
From the city of angels!
An empty vessel of devils!
Is there no one to save us?
Look through my eyes see the world that you gave us!
