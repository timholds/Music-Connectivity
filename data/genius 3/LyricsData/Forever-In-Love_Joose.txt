Each and every night
I wish upon the stars
That I will always stay with you
And that nothing and no one
Can tear our love apart
No matter what we may go through
Soon I'll know that my wish has come true
Because...

[Chorus:]
Forever in love
With you I'll be
Like the heavens above
For eternity
You will be mind and I will be yours
Our love will last
Forever more

[verse2:]
There's no better way
I'd rather spend my time
Then holding you close
Every day and night for always
To wake and see you in the morning light
Is how I dreamed it could be
For the rest of my days
Soon I'll know that my dream has come true
Because...

[Chorus:]
Forever in love
With you I'll be
Like the heavens above
For eternity
You will be mine and I will be yours
Our love will last

[bridge:]
For as long as the sun shines in your eyes
I want you by my side
Forever till the end of time
For as long as the stars keep on shining bright
I want you in my life
For the rest of my days
I will love you always

[Chorus to fade]
