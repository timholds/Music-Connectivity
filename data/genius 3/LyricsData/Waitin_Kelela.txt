[Intro]
Falling into the sky
Falling into each other
Falling into the sky
Falling into each other

[Verse 1]
Saw you there and it fucked me up
But I'm working now, it's just my luck
Shoulda said, "Can we go to bed?" (Now you're gone)
Now we're back to where we started from
And I wait, I wait
And I wait for you to turn around
But I know you're right
We're never coming down
And I know you've thought about it
Though we've been miles away
If you ask me, I'll tell you what's happening

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn, didn't we have a good time?
Spinning around, we couldn't get off our ride
Damn, didn't we put up a fight?
I'm trying to push it, don't let me lose it now

[Chorus]
Been waiting for today
But I don't know what to say
And you don't know you'd done it
But I'm in my head and I can't forget even later on

[Verse 2]
Stop
Let me catch my breath
Realize you ain't seen me yet (It's not the same)
It's all I dreamed of (As before)
It can't get started
Just a little bit of light
It's early morning now
Then we talk it up
It's hard to figure out
We're getting looks but they can say what they wanna say
If they ask me, I'll tell them right away

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Searched, didn't know I would find
Despite what you took, I miss what you gave
Will you stay now?
Was cold and we turned it around
'Cause winter's always warmer when you're 'round

[Chorus]
Been waiting for today
But I don't know what to say
And you don't know you'd done it
But I'm in my head and I can't forget even later on

[Bridge]
Been waiting for today
But I don't know what to say
And you don't know you'd done it
But I'm in my head, even later on

[Chorus]
Been waiting for today
But I don't know what to say
(What more can I say, baby?)
And you don't know you'd done it
But I'm in my head and I can't forget even later on

[Outro]
Falling into the sky
Falling into each other
Falling into the sky
Falling into each other
