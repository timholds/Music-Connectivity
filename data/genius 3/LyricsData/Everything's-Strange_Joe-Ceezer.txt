[Hook]
And I can't predict the changes
Can't predict the change
And I can't predict the changes
Everything's so strange (4x)
And I can't predict the change

[Verse 1]
They say everything's changed
To me it all looks the same
For the past fity years
They been controllin' our brains
Makin' are asses go deranged over the latest dance craze or the hottest boy band
Or the biggest soiree's
There ain't no such thing as the good 'ol days
Ever since you were born you been locked, and chained
Made to believe that it's supposed to be this way
Don't even know why i'm makin' this it's all in vain
I never know it was a crime to be in love, and gay
I never knew it was a sin to worship God this way
I never knew it was so strange to push for change, but if you wanna survive you better stay the same
Man everything's strange

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
An institution that's you can degrade as long as you straight
A god that allows you to kill if it's in his name
A president that don't give a fuck about Gaza Strip, Afghanistan, Egypt, or even the country that he's leadin'
Yeah i'm learnin' more from Lupe then I ever did from television
The only motherfucker telliin' us whats cookin' in the kitchen, but now i'm dishing' out these rhyming truths and lyric inquisitions so nail me to this cross still don't give a fuck whats you thinkin'

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You don't believe that everything's strange man
You don't believe that everything's not right
Motherfucker they controllin' your mind
Don't believe me
Take a look at the dollar sign

[Hook]
