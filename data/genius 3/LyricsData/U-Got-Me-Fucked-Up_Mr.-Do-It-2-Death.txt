And why they call me "Crazy", cuz mutha fucka they can't control this

You can mug all night in the club, I don't give a fuck, my guys got cha
You got some (?) like Do It 2 Death up in ya, they beat it up out cha

Read the billboard, read it and weap
Niggas say I'm irigant, hoes say I act like I'm all that
Tell 'em "Ain't shit changed" and
"Who really gives a fuck except my drawback"
Ya'll thought I was leakin, bitch-nigga ya'll caught in a fog
I'm still (?) ya'll walkin a dog
Nigga I can personify the shit I spit, I ain't just flossin at ya'll
One thangs fo' sho, don't let me score I'm caught in a ball
Niggas say they wanna see me make it
Knowin that they really wanna see me fall
Nigga I'ma cross this line, whether I run, walk or crawl

Chorus:1x
