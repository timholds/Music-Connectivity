When I find myself in times of trouble
Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be
And in my hour of darkness
She is standing right it front of me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

When all the broken hearted people
Living in this world agree
There will be an answer
Let it be
And though they may be parted there is
Still a chance that they will see
There must be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There will be an answer
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
There must be an answer
Let it be

And though the night is cloudy
There is still a light that shines on me
Shine until tomorrow
Let it be
I wake up to the sound of music
And Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom
Let it be

Oh, Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be

Let it be, let it be
Let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom
Let it be
