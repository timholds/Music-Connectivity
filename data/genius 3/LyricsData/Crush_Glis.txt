You and me
Have reached the end it seems
You couldn't make a change
I couldn't get it right

It's not a force
That creeps towards infinity
It's just the shadow I see
Haunting my memory

And now I feel all alone
I don't know where to go
There is no home left for me
Forgotten imagery

It cuts the soul deep
There is no dream for sleep
There's only one way to go
I'm crushing down the doors

I took my first step
Towards a better life
There's only one way to go

I got a second chance
I have to make this right
I'm crushing down the doors
