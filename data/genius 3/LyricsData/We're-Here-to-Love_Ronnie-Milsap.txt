We all live on a little ball spinning somewhere in space
A tiny dot in the universe reserved for the human race
And as our planet obeys the laws of gravity, nature and time
We must look to the heart and find our part that we play in the grand design

We're here to love, oh, we've all got the power, ah, it's our finest hour
Though the stars up in heaven keep shining down
From the ghetto to the Holy land somebody's needing somebody's hand
And it's time that we all understand we're here to love

Some will lose their soul to the power of gold and all that it may possess
They count their blessings by the things that they own
Never learning that more is less
But from the moment we're born until the fading light
All the seasons that turn in between
It's the love that you give and the hours you give
That's the measure of the life that you lead

We're here to love, oh, we've all got the power, ah, it's our finest hour
Though the stars up in heaven keep shining down
From the ghetto to the Holy land somebody's needing somebody's hand
And it's time that we all understand we're here to love...
