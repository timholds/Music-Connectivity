[Verse 1: Dels]
Standing on the stairwell to hell
But don’t cross me though
I’m mega superstitious, one-nut-job-to-go
Serve me with a cold beer, turn up your speaker
It’s time we got acquainted
Wagwan? nice to meet ya!
Post-Internet, Wi-Fi-Fo-Fum
And I’ll never “go Pop”, I’d rather die, Ho-Hum!
Bold type cloud the lungs
To all those on keyboards all bumping gums...
You can all suck me plumbs!
Scrapping until death becomes, for life’s crumbs
I’m not one of those lost ones, who push lungs for lump sums
To my Youth with dum dums
This is for Section.80
Here’s my cake, who want’s some?
Love, you’ve got to shout louder
Crank up the hearing aid, dialogues the power
I shower my thoughts to empower
Extra-terrestrial, like a flower
Growing on the surface of Mars
This is my hour
Running out time like Bauer
Oh life’s sour!
Been bunning Babylon since ’95
Getting hype on the mic, yeah we’re streaming live

[Hook: Dels]
Drip, drip
Dripping all these colours of my mind
Let the colours just drip, drip
Dripping all these colours of my mind
Let the colours just drip, I let them drip
Dripping all these colours of my mind
Let the colours just drip, drip

[Verse 2: Dels]
She’s uploading pics of her arse since the CIA’s tapping us
In a lack-lustre fashion, lacking trust and thus we must
Kick up some dust and don’t sleep in the belly of the beast
I’m trying to eat more than spag bol for tea
And get left in graveyard for ‘Have-Been’ MC’s
Where they form cover bands and perform classic LP’s
Much to the despair of the audience...
As So Solid’s Harvey sings along to ‘Accordion’
Step into proverbial Delorean
There’s no ignoring him, he’s got a sword with him
He’s war ridden
Just exposing a few fears, downing a few beers
Having a chin-wag wit the page my love / dears
Let’s have a toast the young years
And Lord-Willing they’ll roll over, like a boulder
Chasing me through life’s labyrinth, not sober
I’m in a food coma
Dreaming I’m sailing to Barcelona on a ring donut
With a cold Corona
That’s unsound fallacy but makes sense in the fabrication of my mind’s tapestry
Been bunnin’ Babylon since ’95
Getting hype on the mic, yeah we’re streaming live

[Reprise]
Drip
Dripping all these colours of my mind
Let the colours just drip, drip
Dripping all these colours of my mind
Let the colours just drip, drip
Dripping all these colours of my mind
Let the colours just drip, drip
Dripping all these colours of my mind
Let the colours just drip
