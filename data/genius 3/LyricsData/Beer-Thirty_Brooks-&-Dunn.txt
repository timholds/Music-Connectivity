[Verse 1]
I got a six pack, got a single stem rose
My baby's dressed up she's raring to go
I got a Jones for the moon and the jukebox
I like to two step she likes to rock
That clock on the wall it rings, it chimes
It's beer thirty, a honky tonk time

[Chorus]
Life's too short, let's get to living it
Let's give it all we can give it
Let your hair down, turn the music up
We going to paint the town flat, tear it up
The party starts here get in line
Beer thirty a honky tonk time

[Verse 2]
I put in my four day
I'm going home
Lord my get-up has got up and gone
Got my pay check I'm on my way
It's finally Friday my kind of day
I punch the clock, I hit the road flying
It's beer thirty, a honky tonk time

[Chorus][x2]
