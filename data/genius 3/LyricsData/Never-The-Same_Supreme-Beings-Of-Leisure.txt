Soft hands my drug
You taste like home to me
Echoing reverberations
I am now remembering
Your kiss is a dream
Elations extreme

One step closer
I am one step closer to heaven

And now I'm never the same
Never the same girl twice
Oh no I'm never the same
Never the same girl twice
Not the same girl you loved last night

Mysterious chemistry
Someone's cookin in the kitchen
Elixir of the pearl
A luscious berry swirl
I'm losin' some sleep
No company I'd rather keep

One step closer
I am one step closer to heaven

And now I'm never the same
Never the same girl twice
Oh no I'm never the same now
Never the same girl twice
Not the same girl you loved last night
( Not the same girl you fucked last night )

Never the same
Never the same girl twice
Oh no I'm never the same now
Never the same girl twice
Not the same girl you loved last night
Not the same girl you loved last night
Never the same, never the same
Never the same, never the same
Never the same, never the same
