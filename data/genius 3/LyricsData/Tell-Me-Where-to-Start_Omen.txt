[Hook]
Yeah, tell me where to start, baby
Tell me where to start baby
And you know I won't stop
Tell me where to start baby

[Verse 1]
I bring the reel (real) like cinemas
My bedroom had every color united you can call it Benetton
I'm like a Renaissance lover
Baby and I'm charming
Come here girl, be my Jane, I could be your Tarzan
Tell me girl, is you feeling me?
Tell me please, baby, how did you get in them jeans?
You're talented, I'm striking fire like a matchbox
And now you got my whole back filled with scratch marks
I never slack off, matter of fact, baby doll pull my slacks off
And take off your black bra
You're so in the mood, I'm so feeling you
Heat of the moment, ain't no telling what we finna do

[Hook]
Tell me where to start baby
And you know I won't stop, won't stop
Just tell me where to start baby, and I won't stop
Just tell me where to start baby, and I won't stop, won't stop
Just tell me where to start baby
I won't stop

I say mane, I'm all over that
And now she all pouring sweat
She throw it back like a hike to a quarterback
Passionate in the bed, she acting ignorant
She getting tapped like a package of cigarettes
She was a tri-stater, She had some fly flavor
She whispered in my ear I'm better than her vibrator
I tell her, "Please, tell me something that I don't know"
Cause I go hard, I ain't never been "so so"
I mean I'm so pro
She dripping like slow glow
She's a dirty fighter, just gave me a low blow
I told you girl I bring the real
Baby doll, tell me how you feel

Tell me where to start baby, and I won't stop, won't stop
Just tell me where to start baby, and I won't stop, won't stop
Just tell me where to start baby, and I won't stop
Tell me where to start baby, and I won't stop, won't stop

Now see, I'm feeling you, I know you're feeling me
So let's get in the mood, and let's get in them sheets
Now see, I'm feeling you, I know you're feeling me
So let's get in the mood, and let's get in them sheets
Yeah, I'm like 6'4", I make your clit roar
My name is Omen, and in my pants, I got my pitchfork
I'm about to teach a couple things like a mentor
And if my phone ring, know I'm pressing ignore
I'm here to explore, I'm here to pledge allegiance
Your pussycat deserve praise like it's ancient Egypt
Ha, I told your girl I bring the real
Baby doll, tell me how you feel
