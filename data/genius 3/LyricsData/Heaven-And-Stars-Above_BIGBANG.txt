I want you to come out and play with me
I want you to see what i see
I want you to help me across the line
I want you to read my mind

All i want is a little love
Heaven and stars above

I want you to come out and get it right
I know you came close but not quite
And now the flowers are in bloom
And the song is called dust my broom

What are you trying to say
All i want is a little love
Heaven and stars above
What are you gonna give me
All i want is a little love
Heaven and stars above

You know where the ocean
Meets the sky
We'll unzip and we'll fly
Do you know what i feel
I think we've got something real

What are you trying to say
All i want is a little love
I can't hear you
Heaven and stars above
What are you gonna give me
All i want is a little love
Heaven and stars above
