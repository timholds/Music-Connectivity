Oriental love story

Kawasu kotoba sure chigai yorisoitada mitsumeau
Wasure wa shinai romance

Wakachiaeru yume mo naku kizutsukeau kotoba kari
Ano hi no maboroshi yo

Kareta mizuumi no (tori (kanji: han)) de kami wo hodoku ananta wo ima
Mo

Asai nemuri yume no naka tsukano manara dakiaou
Aa mou kore kiri oh

Furui suisaiga no naka de nureta hitomi ni jin da shoujo

Stay with me you can't stay here
Ushiro sugata
Stay with me i love you forever
Te wo furu kage
Stay with me you can't stay here
Sukoshi samui
Stay with me i love you forever
Subete hoho ni tsutau

Furui suisaiga no naka de nureta hitomi ni jin da shoujo

Stay with me you can't stay here
Ushiro sugata
Stay with me i love you forever
Te wo furu kage
Stay with me you can't stay here
Sukoshi samui
Stay with me i love you forever
Subete hoho ni tsutau

Stay with me you can't stay here
Kotoba mo naku
Stay with me i love you forever
Nani wo omou (sings something different though)
Stay with me you can't stay here
Yume no tsuzuki
Stay with me i love you forever
Subete hoho ni tsutau...

Stay with me you can't stay here
Stay with me i love you forever
Stay with me you can't stay here
Stay with me i love you forever
