Fire in the booth any time Skys in it
Footprints on the moon so forget this guys limit
I don't freestyle cause this is making man Lizzy
So ring the Blackberry bet it's telling man busy!
I couldn't give a fuck about your beef in your ends
I'm way too busy with the trees and the the tents
The fans and extractors
UV lightbulbs, my brudda I could grow 5 bricks with my eyes closed
My hands tied on a tightrope
The lights off and the blinds closed
I'm talking biz on my Nokia not no iPhone
This is what you call the dodger cell site flow
Blackberry popping cause you know a nigga popular
Paranoid only talk proper on my Nokia
Looking through the windows and I'm feeling like they're watching us
Hit my brudda up I said I think somebody followed us
I'm harder than ever the flows on steroids
The bars like a feather, I'm pumping
Them bruddas are fly but I'm flee so I'm jumping
Pole vault
Ya brudda got touched cause he jumped in his own fault
Extra, I'm the hot topic when ya chatting
Jenga so the money wobbles when I stack it
The shotters them are banging
You want it you can have it
Cause everybody gets it even Roger if he rabbits
All the chicks love it when you get your name buzzing
I done a sis' already now I'm tryna fuck the cousin
Her boyfriends bigger than Konan
But true I Play Dirty
You know the girl Krept with the Yungen
Cash in the wallet, blade in the back pocket
When the chips down I be weighing up my Oz's
Living in the ghetto's like laying in the coffin
So if PRS ramp, I be spraying up a office
I don't really act I just do what I do
I just get a script read a bit, then move how I move
Play the role that want I can say what I like
It's like the trap house man are getting paid of a lines
Big stages help me get the big wages
Got a new script now I'm tryna flick pages
Tryna find a role that I like, that I can work with
God bless the winner flow cause it let me earn quick
Fire in the booth any time Skys in it
Footprints on the moon so forget this guys limit

There ain't nobody like me on a hundred and fourty
It's easy
I spray 16 brudda, I make ya hundred look boring
Believe me
And I ain't even trying
Funny thing is I ain't even lying
Rumble in the jungle the Lion with a iron
The flows unorthodox I worked on it while I bagged up quarter shots
I don't chat with the little man, or the middle man
So go ahead call your boss
Skywalker I call the shots
You should be informer, you called the cops
I just got a call from the bing
I spoke to my brudda called Biz
He said he weren't happy with a few things
So I'm gonna handle the biz
Been on tour for a minute now I'm back in the bits
I made more than a bag and a bit
Yeah, Cah my old flows better than your new one
And what the hell have you done
Who are you star?
Who are you star with that flow?
You'll never get far with that flow
Na No, It's funny how I walk in here and make the whole ting sound like it's all prepared
Skin a brudda alive like Mike with the flow
Them man are too girly like Shirley
Them bruddas should wear tights with the flow
Me I'm like Scrooge with it
Batman money, going on tight with the flow
Let me talk real real talk
Man are billin a zoot, I'm on a billboard
I'm all over the side of the bus
I used to ride on a bus
Yeah, one little poster campaign
Every night a load of champagne
Einstein the grind get loads a mad brain
Me? I had so many fuck buddys
Last year made loads of Young Money
And I don't even roll with Mack Maine
I'm done!
