Nobody talking to nobody anymore, that's the problem man
Everybody wanna run around, do what they wanna do
Til two in they ass no homo (mhm)

[Verse 1]
No degree, but I got knowledge of self
I, polished my styled, laced my wallets with wealth
Now I acknowledge my health
In the mirror I just smile at myself (damn!)
Think you fly? Feel like a pilot myself
Violence
I move in silence, I announce it as stealth
Four pound to the bouncer, try pronouncing my belt
Pounds
Half of pounds, kilos, ounces I dealt
Heat, you clowns would just melt
Beat niggas down, give em welts
The streets is fucked up, government giving no help
They get high off the water, niggas living like Phelps
My block have millimeters, hollow points was the finest
A better word to define us? The 140th niners (word)
(Why?) nine nines nine to nine
We ain't care if you was deaf, dumb, stupid or blind
Stoop to stoop with them dimes
Recruit the youth losing they mind
Build a bomb, put em on
Yeah, coupe to coupe when we shine

[Not a Chorus]
Nah mean?
Ain't no chorus on this man
Just roll one up and think about it man
I don't sell wolf tickets
I don't tell you no lies, I don't sell dreams man
Think about it
Don't sell yourself short neither
If you're easy to get you're easy to for-get
Remember that

[Verse 2]
You'll be John Doe, I run with some no-namers
Never met celebrity, don't even wanna know famous (they ain't with it)
I call em my disclaimers that tote stainless
Fifth bangers from La Havana, no English (espa√±ol)
What you want baby? E, Molly, or nose English?
She said "number 3!"
Oh, you feelin' cocaineish
Turned fiend, b-ball rapper or a dope singer
In an alley self aborting with a coat hanger
To this environment, understand that I'm no stranger
Mo' money, mo' homicide, mo' danger
The love is fake, the hate is real, and your anger
Gon' leave em with broke fingers
Believe me, he's no gangsta
I come from poverty, for that coke ma was starving me
Curving me for that Ramen need fronto leaf for this harmony
Long nights, long johns while armed for the robbery
A life of crime, this life of mine
I swear I need a warranty

Sheesh!
Just let that joint ride out man
I smoked eight blunts
I'm high man
Let that joint fade out
