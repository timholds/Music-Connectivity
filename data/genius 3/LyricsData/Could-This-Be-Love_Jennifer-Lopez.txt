[Verse 1]
If you only knew
What I have been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
How, tell me how will I know
Will my heart make me believe it so
Or can I trust the way I feel
If you could read my mind
You see how hard I have tried
Still I can't decide

[Chorus]
If you only knew
What I have been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love
Tell me could this be love

[Verse 2]
Do you know if it is true
That real love lasts a lifetime
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky
And do you know if you can fall for
Just a moment
Is a moment for all time
Why, why am I so unsure
Is that love knocking at my door
Or the sound of my beating heart
If you could read my mind
You know I just can't hide
What I feel inside

[Chorus]
