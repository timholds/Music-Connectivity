[GERMANS]
Germany was having trouble
What a sad, sad story
Needed a new leader to restore
Its former glory
Where, oh, where was he?
Where could that man be?
We looked around and then we found
The man for you and me

[LEAD TENOR STORMTROOPER]
And now it's...
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
Deutschland is happy and gay!
We're marching to a faster pace
Look out, here comes the master race!
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
Rhineland's a fine land once more!
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
Watch out, Europe
We're going on tour!

Springtime for Hitler and Germany

[Chorus]
Look, it's springtime

[HEIL-LOS]
The Fuhrer is causing a furor!
He's got those Russians on the run
You gotta love that wacky hun!
The Fuhrer is causing a furor
They can't say "no" to his demands
They're freaking out in foreign lands
He's got the whole world in his hands
The Fuhrer is causing a furor!

[ROGER]
I was just a paper hanger
No one more obscurer
Got a phone call from the Reichstag
Told me I was Fuhrer
Germany was blue
What, oh, what to do?
Hitched up my pants
And conquered France
Now Deutschland's smiling through!

(spoken)
But it wasn't always so easy... It was 1932. Hindenburg was working the Big Room and I... why I was playing the lounge. And then I got my big break. Somebody burned down the Reichstag! And, would you believe it? They made me Chancellor. Chancellor!

(sung)
It ain't no myst'ry
If it's politics or hist'ry
The thing you gotta know is
Ev'rything is show biz
Heil myself
Watch my show
I'm the German Ethel Merman
Dontcha know
We are crossing borders
The new world order is here
Make a great big smile
Ev'ryone sieg heil to me
Wonderful me!
And now it's...

[Chorus]
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
Goose-step's the new step today

[MEN]
Bombs falling from the skies again

[Chorus]
Deutschland is on the rise again

[ALL]
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
U-boats are sailing once more
Springtime for Hitler and Germany

[ROGER]
Means that

[Chorus]
Soon we'll be going

[ROGER]
We've got to be going

[Chorus]
You know we'll be going

[ROGER]
You bet we'll be going!

[ALL]
You know we'll be going to war!
