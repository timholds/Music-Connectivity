Don't be afraid
Don't be afraid
I keep on telling myself that I'm alright
But I know that this one's another turn
When I let her go, when I was fine, oh I can't lie
Cause I never fell harder, I stopped when you started
Arrived when you parted & now I'm stuck here
Why did I listen to my inhibitions and run
When there was nowhere to go?

Now I know, you were the only one
Now I'm the lonely one watching the days go by
I can never forgive myself
I think that I need some help, because

I'm afraid of love, love, love (4x)

I turn the light off at night when I start to cry
I don't wanna see my life passing by
I finally found someone who could open up my eyes
Cause I never fell harder, I stopped when you started
Arrived when you parted & now I'm stuck here
Why did I listen to my inhibitions and run
When there was nowhere to go?

Now I know, you were the only one
Now I'm the lonely one watching the days go by
I can never forgive myself
I think that I need some help, because

I'm afraid of love, love, love (8x)
(I'm so afraaaaaid)

Now I know, you were the only one
Now I'm the lonely one watching the days go by
I can never forgive myself
I think that I need some help, because

I'm afraid of love, love, love (8x)
