[Hook: Party Arty]
Check it out this is how it's going down
From the Boogie Down, brothers stand around with a frown (Repeat 2x)

Time to hit ya, let the melody split ya dome
Poems I'm deadly, Holmes better get the picture
See these vibes are visible
Fiends seen it in the mental, chicks get it in the physical
We had to lounge now I'm furious
Fake hip-hoppers can they do it in '95, I'm curious
Cause my squad has sickness, crazy sickness
Hit the herb, let the words start flowing with the riches
Don't compare me when you hear me
I stay true, and when I'm through, it'll pay dearly
Dre's a giant no question, but what I question
Is how now this is your profession
I'm charged off the lye
How we do? (Spray 'em)
Bless 'em, impress 'em, and hang 'em high
Take your loot like Vegas and produce pages
And styles go for miles, like Davis
My potential, with Show's instrumental
Got you all zoning on the vibes that we sent you
In the mental, who's that abusing rap?
Hip Hop from the heart, so it's back to the start, black
And these tracks are incredible
S-H-O to the W, true for our revenue
That's how we feel in the BX, mics are what I bless
Time to get down with the boogie

[Hook x2]

I got a mind like Minolta
Me and Show go back like the D.A. on Travolta
I want cheese like ziti
You'll get left like Riunite (on ice) for trying to be me
I jam, sucker, like The Garden or The Rucker
Over tracks (Your girl caught the claps) then I stuck her
No front, all I want is to be happy
Probably like Mary, but if you dare me, then we'll get scrappy
Don't lift weights, let the hand speed dictate
The Giant is great from back then til this date
I take the cake and I bounce with the whole weight
A weapon, stepping straight from Section 8
And if you sleep then you might not wake
If you fake the moves, then your tools I'm a take
I want to see you stop me to those that knock me
Amazing with blazing talents like Rodney
Strick with the voodoo, peace to Chaka Zulu
In the clutch, I can't be touched, they must be noodles
Too many skills for you to try to doubt
Put your money where your mouth, I'm a make you wear your mouth
I've had it, time to get bruised and battered
I'm like Erving or Shaq, cause I'm great with that black magic
It's nothing when my man's on production
I reign (you catch a blow to your brain) concussion
Rap savior, the more the major
Bring 'em all on, and they'll get shitted on with flavor
Reality is what it's all about
So when you hear the vibes of Show & A, then check it out
