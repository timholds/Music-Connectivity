Why should I give a fuck
What other people do with their lives
I choose my own path
Do what I gotta do to survive
I don't need anyone to tell me how to live my life
I do things my own way, do what I think is best for me
I believe in myself
I can do anything I want
But I've gotta do it myself, can't depend on no one
I know this life won't meet me half way
I've gotta give it my all, if I want to succeed

I won't follow, any of those fools I see
Who strife all their lives to get a high title in society
Just makin' my livin' is all that matters to me
And the way I do it is up to me!!!!!!

Why should I give a fuck what other people do with their lives
I choose my own path; do what I gotta do to survive
