I'd like to say thank you, for joining us this evening
I hope you enjoyed yourself
Now the boys and I have one more number we'd like to play for you
I hope you stick around, these are the after hours
So my fellas in here pour up one more glass of scotch
Stick around for a little bit
And all the ladies, what I want you to do right now..
I want you to look me directly in my eyes
I can promise you this, I will looking back at you
And I see you, I see you..


Baby, you, your smile remind me of sunshine, girl
You smile just like roses
You say you don't need a man
Well, I just want your loving, darling

I wonder how I can tell you
The way you make me feel
You make me feel high

Baby, we could change the world forever
We should turn it into something better, than good
You crying as this change before your eyes

Me and you do what normal people do
And you're so, so beautiful, your body just the vehicle

Baby, you, you took me by surprise
I swear I see the whole world in your eyes
Next time you're sad and lone
Please let my love take you home
Baby, you
No one but you
It's only you, nobody, nobody but you

Why, why must I lay here awake
When I could be dreaming of your face?
You wait up, go to sleep then I'll see you in a second
Baby, try, just try to love me again
And if not, just pretend
I'm scared you'll, you'll fall
In love, love with somebody else
And, who can save you from yourself?
Because there's not life without you
There's something about you, I know
Something's special, I'm sure
Cause girl your love is so pure
And I want it all

Baby, you, you took me by surprise
I swear I see the whole world in your eyes
Next time you're sad and lone
Please let my love take you home
Baby, you
No one but you
It's only you, nobody, nobody but you

You, nobody but you
Baby, I'm not gonna leave you, I know
Baby, said no one but you, nobody but you
Said nobody
