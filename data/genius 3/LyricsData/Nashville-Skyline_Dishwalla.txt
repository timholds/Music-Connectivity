Don't go on
Looking for the love
In the illusion of it all
The answers in the dream
Cause I have been through mire and confusion
I am free
As far as I can see

Is Nashville skyline
Underneath it all
You yourself are free

14 hours ago
I was living in a dream
I was living for the scene
I was floating high above
Cause I have been through mire and confusion
I am free

As far as I can see
Is Nashville skyline
Underneath it all
You yourself are free
Floating high above
The Nashville skyline

And underneath it all
Yourself are free
You yourself are
Forevermore is the love that you need to believe
And you yourself are there
Floating high above
The Nashville skyline
