[Intro]
Aww shit,man

[Chorus]
I bet you,bet you never ever met a demon like moi
I bet you,bet you never ever seen a demon like moi
I bet you,bet you never ever met a demon like moi
A,a,a demon like moi

(but if you want some progress,I give you the light)
(so girl just pour some,puff pass,whateva ya like)
(but If you want some progress just give me the light)

[Verse 1]
Well I guess there's no need to tell you what happened in 2012
Some prophets preach us and teach us to stay good or burn in hell
Apocalypsis in scriptures described it well in detail
And how all Jesus missions exposed those vicious bitches and I can tell
My mirror-mirror on the wall to-told me that I'm evil
If I look the rearview mirror,can see the people I grieved,I
Wish I'd believe in her before I turned into this creature
God is tha only leader,the only med to this heat,I
I even wished death to my momma
I was clearly creating dramas
Fuckin' women for the only pleasure of being inside
Broke too many hearts while mine's slowly commited suicide
Didn't know what I was losing,now bruises remind my cruces
Some say that I'm a pussy
Cause I'm no gangsta as Boosie
But I'm more manly than you,see
Wot sign the pact,excuse me
They sayin' that you provide and put bitches in the jacuzzi
Money and women soon I'll get 'em with this fuckin' music
This shit is too sick
And hard and slick like my dick
I'll fuck you like a demon but treat you good like a gentleman
'cause baby I spent time in hell but I ain't never coming back
Tell Belseb√∫ that Im a fighter and I don't waste my time on crap

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Here we go again 'nother chapter of the book of life
The world still the same,so I better become 'nother light
Too much villains and sinners around us,wanting to divide
Too damn spite,fool,I dont get why you think that shit tight
Even my inner demon knows winners doing it right
Take care your women,cause venus always turn on the night
Yep Im a beast on the sheets,girl ain't that shit nice?
Atracting my opposite,girl I'm cold as ice
On some Yin-Yang shit,since the Big Bang,bitch!
Got my bling bling since the day that I born
And I ain't talkin' bout chains,man I'm talking bout soul
And since it seems that you got none,I'm talkin bout Po
And criminals that kills and rape,sometimes just for fun
Or money,no new friends 'til you prove that I'm wrong
Man I swear I'm feelin' so brilliant
Cause that's what I really am
I release my demons only when it's convenient
Huh,is you an idiot? fuck you think I'm obedient?
Nah,I'm fuckin with the TD and all the pretty angels
That makes me greedy and wanting a billion pussies everyday
Got the ingredient for that lustful experience,yeah
I'm fuckin' dirty like a fuckin' brazilian,Ha
But I come from Chile,look dat in your enciclopedia
I'm so fuckin' pretty and lovely girl,If I want to
Just like my penis,I'm a phoenix ready for round two (round two)
Proud to be the best friend of my demon
So If you try to touch my family
I'll probably break your femur
Don't lie man,I can be meaner
I promise that I will kill you!
This rhymes ain't even spitted,man these bars are puked
To you

[Chorus]
