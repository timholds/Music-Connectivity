She comes home at 5:30
And though her clothes are never dirty
She'll change them just the same
She likes to keep her name

She's giving it all up for love
Up for love
Up for love
She's giving it all up for love
Tattoo giving it up
Giving it up

She's giving it all up for love
Up for love
Up for love
She's giving it all up for love
Tattoo giving it up
Giving it up

She's got a tattoo on her tummy
And her Mummy plays gin rummy
Hey, you might think it's funny
But she's making all the money

She's giving it all up for love
Up for love
Up for love
She's giving it all up for love
Tattoo giving it up
Giving it up

She's giving it all up for love
Up for love
Up for love
She's giving it all up for love
Tattoo giving it up
Giving it up

She keeps a silver armadillo
Well hidden beneath her pillow
Now some think it's a cupie doll
But they've got such crazy minds

She's giving it all up for love
Up for love
Up for love
She's giving it all up for love
Tattoo giving it up
Giving it up

She's giving it all up for love
Up for love
Up for love
She's giving it all up for love
Tattoo giving it up
Giving it up

Oh, she has a unique technique
For making me obsolete, complete
She needs a beat
She needs it sweet
She needs it neat

She's giving it all up for love
Up for love
Up for love
She's giving it all up for love
Tattoo giving it up
Giving it up

She's giving it all up for love
Up for love
Up for love
She's giving it all up for love
Tattoo giving it up
Giving it up
