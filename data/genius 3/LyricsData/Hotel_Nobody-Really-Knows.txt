[Verse 1: Andre McCloud]
Bitches better bow down once they see the boy shining
Resume long so you know the boy about gridin
Backsmith wax rips to my fuckin head
Hunger isn't much if you the nigga gettin fed
Break bread and cabbage this nigga leakin' like a head gasket and he like to sleep in caskets
Way above average y'all niggas sub par
Smoke you like the kief in my cigar bitch I'm high touchin' stars
All of my checks come foreign like my broads and my cars
Know you niggas can't afford it self absorbent
So when I bust hit the floor quick ain't no duck dodgin'
Multi hit you like a sqaudron, ain't nobody hearin' sirens
Ship you off like my last zip scotch fifth on the rocks make me reach that hot temp
Catch a glimpse greatness in the makin can't stop cause I love the chasin
Smokin' weed while them dollaz steady rain in bitch

[Hook: Pyramid Murdock]
It's never what it seems, dirty green in a rubber band
You've compiled lies just to scheme in the Motherland
Don liven lavish so you can fill the Dutch up
Seems Im toasted to the world so the waiters fill my cups up
See it's never what it seems , dirty green in a rubber band
And you've compiled lies just to scheme in the Motherland
Every single purchases comes with a tax
So before you snort my bitches know you have to pay me back
Pay me back nigga

[Verse 2: Gloomy Pyramid]
Chill up, the room is chill cause they know it's us
The flow is us, remember the room cause they know it's sus, sus flow to the clause pattern
No manner, just a flatter of the pyramid manor, tatted like sailor moon's saturn
I don't have a phone to answer
I have time for laughter and time to wait
These dreams will never deflate like the baloons on your childhood birthday
So in the worst way, i'll save this is shit
And plaster it all over the globe
And make sure that you know
This tactical provision
Word plays and crush claws, a lot of superstisioun
Gold stays brighter in the eyes of the one given
I'll remain silent until the light has risen
Pyramid is the last name, fan based is the paint job
On the Audi 99' with the Shelby cherry red drippin'
And make sure you know, 40's on the hoes
And nobody really knows

[Hook: Pyramid Murdock]

[Verse 3: Pyramid Vritra]
Fuck the function bitch I'm posted in the inner cut
Prolly making beats
Verbals trickle feel the tempo like sir Wilson g
No Jesus piece. Around my neck instead I preach to thee the tales from how I see, the world momma created when father learned how keep his piece
I spit my piece and depart
These niggas sweet and we tart
That sour twist your mind and I'm not talking about the flower diesel
Lotus wine. On the grind. down fo that fucking crime
Haters find they asinine catch them niggas reciting lines
Thought we didn't notice huh?
Thought that you was waxed ledge
Jagged
Not the group but lyric and blade
From a slave to a slave buying shackles and chains
Trade a trade for a name gain the key to the game and use the game for the fame then forget where you came
Witness the reign of change
By them NRK weirdos
Talent undeniable surrounded by dinero
Heros to them zeros and them nerdy niggas in band

[Hook: Pyramid Murdock]
