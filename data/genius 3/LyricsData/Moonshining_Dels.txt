Moonshining
Yo yo, we're moonshining

[Verse 1]
If you liquidize my words
You would dance for infinity
Moonshine through your bloodstream
No remedy
Equivalent to slime when I rhyme
Can't belly me
Can't stomach the bars
I'm dark flow, ebony
Solar energy, I'm naturally high
If I can't tough mics I might actually die
I mean actually die, like
Soul touch the sky
Laying on a cloud with a bakewell pie
If you wanna hear knife, gun, knife, gun crime
Feel free to change the channel
'Cus I'm not your guy
He's a clear flannel, sonny
Wipe your eye
You're getting all emotional
Now please don't cry on me
Tired of these kids calling me "cunt"
Calling me "prick"
Throwing pencils about, who threw that?
That hit my lip
The stress kinda follows me home
Fills up my space
This job kinda grates on my bones
Can't erase
The blind leading the blind
The youth lacks vision
They write over legends
And things that are glistening
And this is the world that we're living in?

Mic check 1, 2
Are you listening?

[Verse 2]
As I hopscotch over shit
Trying get home
Sirens are screaming
Headphones are blown
I'm longing for the moonlight
Longing for the stars
I'm longing for my bed
And I'm longing for Mars
I need sleep
Awkward though pouring out the dome
After-work drinks got me feeling kinda slow
Like a polar bear
Casually walking through the snow

We're moonshining
I'm moonshining
We're moonshining
We're just moonshining
We're just moonshining
I'm moonshining
We're just moonshining

[Outro X2]
We're just moonshine
And reflect
And reflection
We use the moonlight
And the dark as a weapon
Our heart's made of glass
Tell me, what do you see?
A high skylark
In our fantasy

In our fantasy
