Oh yeah, yeah
Mmm
Mmm, mm-hmm
Oh, oh
Damn

Must've been C-R-A-Z-Y
We got all out of sync and went bye bye bye
Not too long ago, you was mine mine mine
Seems like yesterday (yesterday)
Ninety on the freeway, pushin' my ride
Heard you got engaged and I'm losin' my mind
Ask myself the question, why why why
Why'd I let you get away from me?

Well you must've been, thinkin' I'm a jerk
Cryin' out to God, tryin' to make this work
Girl you must've been, stayin' with a fool
Loving somebody that could be so cruel
Well you must've been, packin' your bags
Silly of me, I couldn't see the red flag
Girl I'm sure that (sure that) you must have been
Sick and tired of me

Must've been tired of the jewels I bought
You must've been bored with the cars you got
I must've gave you everything you want
But you only wanted love (wanted love)
I must've been too damn blind to see
I thought you wanted much too much of me
Now I'm rollin' down this one way street
And you're all I'm thinkin' of, baby, mmm

Well you must've been, thinkin' I'm a jerk
Cryin' to God, tryin' to make this thing work
Girl you must've been, stayin' with a fool
Loving somebody that could treat you so cruel
Well you must've been, packin' your bags
Silly of me, I couldn't see the red flag
Girl I'm sure that (sure that) you must have been
Sick and tired of me

You must have been
The very one I was supposed to spend
My money, my life, my lover, my wife
Girl I know you were right
You must have been
The very one I was supposed to spend
Spend the rest of my life
Now it cuts like a knife, I know

Well you must've been, thinkin' I'm a jerk
Cryin' to God, tryin' to make this thing work
Girl you must've been, stayin' with a fool
Loving somebody who would treat you so cruel
Well you must've been, packin' all your bags
Silly of me, couldn't see the red flag
Girl I'm sure that (sure that) you must have been
You must have, you must have, you must have

(Well you must've been)
Now I know I don't have, mm, an invitation
(Girl you must've been)
And everybody in this church is gonna be mad at me
(Well you must've been)
I can't let you say "I do," that's why I'm down on my knee
(Girl I'm sure that you must have been)
The preacher said, speak now, speak now or forever hold my peace

Well you must've been (I know, I know, I know, I know, I know)
Girl you must've been (I know, I know, I know, I know, I know)
