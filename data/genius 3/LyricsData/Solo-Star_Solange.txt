At the time, they think that it is fly
Oh, yo', you really need to know, yeah, your looks
Need to be solo
You'll never catch me with something up in your wardobe

(I'm solo) Yeah, I gotta do my own thing

From my hair to my socks, down to my cell phone
I rock it solo, and there's things y'all don't know
So look like twins in Versace, BCBG, Gucci, Bebe
Yeah, I like it but don't buy it 'cause y'all wear
It and ain't for me

(I'm solo) Yeah, I gotta do my own thing
(Solo) Y'all may not understand me
