I've sat and waited for years
Looking for signs to appear-to me
But all I'd see
Was clouded in mystery
And now that I've turned the page
I've broken out of my cage-of fear
That kept me here
A prisoner for so many years

Chorus:
When the sun comes up
The moon goes down
You can find your way back home
If you wait 'til the sun comes round
Now that the tables have turned
I'm taking all that I've learned-with me
Now I can see
The truth is what's burning free

Repeat Chorus:
Bridge/Solo
Now I can stand on my own
No fear of being alone-again
The darkness ends
The moment I see my old friend

Repeat Chorus:
