Pimpin' up through the... {*repeated*}

[Verse 1]
Pimpin' up through the Red Sea like Moses
The coldest phenomena
Let me take it to the place where guillotine dreams
And triple beam make bodies do triple lean
If it seams that I'm in the zone
Seeing red lines shooting over your mother's home
What's going on?
Thirty red dots fly live to the dome for the head shot
Looking for my angle, strangle, you can see demons and angels tangle
Weary, cause the niggas standing near me, can't see me or hear me
I will slaughter you and your main man with these same hands
Closed casket, can't hang man, it's hard to explain man, but my game plan
Is to, is to take it to that same land
With three hundred fifty seven slugs on shift
For three hundred fifty seven slugs on shit
So I'm a tell you where these slugs gon' fit (where the fuck they gon' fit?)
In their arteries
I never understood why these demons and angels kept a part of me
Which make me murder more properly
In the zone, my zone be zoned out
For the wrong route
Cause these niggas pull their chromes out
Blowin' domes out
Let's reverse this psycho-psychology
What the fuck is this screaming inside of me?
Its gotta be, demons with mental telepathy
Catching my misery, flippin' these clips
And open up seven seas

[Hook]
When demons and angels tangle (wh-wh-wh-one)
It's one more way to die; it's one more way to die
One more way to die... (One more way to die)

[Verse 2]
Late at night I can't sleep
Visions of demons up in my bed so I aim with a target
These mother fuckas got my mind in the zone so I pop with the chrome
And I'm born to be heartless, irregardless
I'm in the wrong state of mind
I'm high and whacked off on some laced weed
If you bitches want a line when you face me
You better bring a living god to erase me, to replace me
Cause I can rise in the night with the Glocks
And X off of mankind
You understand I ain't playing to defend mine
I want the world in my palm when I do time, when I do mine
Cause a killer by the multitudes, line 'em up then I'm off 'em dude
Say a word, then I'm offin' you
Fuck around, set trip, hit a buzz, then I off the crew
What you bitches really wanna do, wanna war in thirst mode?
I was born to react with the first blow
Leave your body in the spot where the hearse go
Let the dogs sort 'em out when the wind blow
Lucifer in the physical, fucked around with the spiritual
Demonize individual
Hit your wife wit' the pump make her jump real high, four feet like in Vertigo

Say hello to the devil, say hello to the devil
Cause here I come, and you can't fuck, can't fuck with me
Say hello to the devil, say hello to the devil
Cause here I come, and you can't fuck, can't fuck with me

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
It's a level beyond wrong and devilish
Bringing to life some shit you should never wish
We 'bout to settle this once and for all
You dyin' tonight but it wasn't my fault
You chose what the fuck you chose
And I took that road, I had to
Take it up with God or Satan bitch
Or blame that ho that had you
See I'm at you
Look at the evil that cash do
I'm down on the tip and I mask you
So don't ask who, when I pass through and mash too
Do the math fool
Ain't no hoes on this side
We that gang you dislike
Fuck a fist fight
These thugs better have they shit right
Cause it's like this forever
Maybe to slit your wrist is better
Is it you slipped and missed the set-up?
But now you hit and spit the wet up
Shit done led up to this
And ain't no turning back at all
Squeezin' with my back at the wall
Leaving you bleeding and even retrieving that stack in ya drawers
A blast and a pause, then another rang out
Isn't it strange how, we commit murder then just go and hang out
With that thang out, and a dub up in my lungs
You'll get gunned up in my slums
Cause the come-up got us sprung

[Hook]
