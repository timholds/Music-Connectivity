[Intro]
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up

[Verse 1]
Up in the club, just broke up
I’m doing my own little thing
Decided to dip but now you wanna trip
Cause another brother noticed me
I’m up on him, he up on me
Don’t pay him any attention
Cried my tears, three good years
Ya can’t be mad at me

[Chorus]
’Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Ohhhhh

’Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

[Verse 2]
I put gloss on my lips, a man on my hips
Hold me tighter than my Deréon jeans
Acting up, drink in my cup
I can't care less what you think
I need no permission, did I mention
Don’t pay him any attention
’Cause you had your turn
But now you gon' learn
What it really feels to miss me

[Chorus]
’Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Ohhhhh

’Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Ohhhhh

[Bridge]
Don't treat me to the things of the world
I’m not that kind of girl
Your love is what I prefer, what I deserve
Here’s a man that makes me, then takes me
And delivers me to a destiny, to infinity and beyond
Pull me into your arms
Say I’m the one you want
If you don’t, you’ll be alone
And like a ghost, I’ll be gone

[Bridge]
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
All the single ladies
Now put your hands up
Ohhhhh
Ohhhhh

[Chorus]
’Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it

’Cause if you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Don’t be mad once you see that he want it
If you liked it then you should have put a ring on it
Ohhhhh
