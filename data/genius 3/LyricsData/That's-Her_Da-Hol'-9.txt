[Hook: Kaos - repeat 2X]
She be by her damn self

She ain't go no time
For these niggas and they liiives
She don't fuck wit hoes cuz
They drove and kuniiiiivin
Yes'ir yes'ir yes'ir
Yes'ir that's her

[Verse 1: Kaos]
There she is dime diva, miss Cinderella
Hangin out wit all her fellas
She ain't no female friends cuz all these hoes jealous
Can't keep no nigga cuz they can't keep up
And Sunshine don't heard it all than 4 mo' peep-up
She know the game inside, she know we all about
Women and diamond, tryin to buy em, grind em and ride
She got her own car, own crib and long as she got
Fresh batteries she don't need a nigga for shit (hell nah)
She a workin woman, nickname Pumpkin, straight out the block
In her 'Cedes bumpin, she roll pumpin Da Hol' 9's album
She keeps it locked to this station becuz they cert'y heat and
They hit you with live AC clubbin urry week
She got her preference when she come to the club
She tokes a burner in her purse and she keeps her own bud
She's been called a scandalous, pussy suckin dyke
Bitches say she trickin hella just cuz she the shiiit

[Verse 2: Kemo]
Yeah, girl why don't you take a trip to myself
Catch a flight, girl pay for the ticket
Bring ya girlfriend baby we can kick it
Take you away from everything wicked
You may only think that I wanna do is stick it, shick it
Create a little mischief, when I look at that ass make a nigga
Straight think about a buttermilk bis-CUIT!  (yes'ir)
You say you diggin my style but ain't been wit a nigga in a while
And I think you bullshittin, you say you don't put a nigga dick in ya mouth (boy please!)
Get the fuck up out the pants, man fuck about the last, nigga that
Ran up in that ass, would've been a laugh, eat sperm
Baby girl till you get a little taste (yes'ir yes'ir)
See baby girl rollin in a Lexus, tellin Kemo he can't sex shit
Look at the necklace, you can tell she don't want nuttin but the "best" shit
She don't gotta roll solo no mo', Golo, rollin wit the Polo, suit
Wit the matchin boots but you don't gotta call her no ho though
What I need is a woman like you see, so we can kick it up like Bruce Lee
Get the puss-y, in the movie, so much don't move me
The fuck you be lyin for? that's what this rhymes for
You ain't got no time to be cryin for

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Verse 3: Kaos]
She sick and tired of these niggas wit all they hoes and they bitches
Thinkin when they get them digits, and smashin always when they visit
Niggas be constantly trickin, off on they dicks on they missions
But derty gon and admit it, you know she don't wanna kick iit..
So you thinkin you can smash, and get it to the pad
So what's up wit that? (you ain't gettin no ass)
You say she talkin trash, and you get mad
Urry spot of that (you ain't gettin no ass)
Ay derty take it from Kemo and Kriss Kreingle, she single
Cuz she ain't never had a mandingo
Pretty eyes, beautiful smile, thick thighs, could maybe bellon me
Wit that belly ring and that baby hella fine
Goddamn, lips glossed, tat's wit them fly nails
Pullin a wagon just like a fuckin Clydesdale
Niggas constantly trickin, they be tryin to hit it daily
It's obvious, why you don't kick it, bitches steady hatin
All these hoes keep yo name in they mouth like dick
And urbody sayin who you done fucked
You've been called a scandalous, pussy suckin dyke
Bitches say you trickin hella just cuz you the shiiit

[Hook] - repeat 2X

[Kaos]
You got these hoes always hatin on you...
And niggas steady tryin to get wit ya crew...
You say you heard they can't take it wit you...
Yes'ir yes'ir yes'ir
Yes'ir that's her
