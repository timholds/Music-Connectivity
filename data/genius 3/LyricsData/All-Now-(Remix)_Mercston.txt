[Hook: Mercston]
Nuff times I
Gotta escape to get my mind right
In the limelight
The light can be too bright for your eyesight
But I'm ready for the flash
Anytime that I pull up inna my ride
I'm the man right now
See your girlfriend giving me the side eye
RIP to the pussy cuh
I beat it up all night
A man said he gonna do me something
But I ain't see nuttin' all now
All now, yeah, yeah, yeah
All now
All now, yeah, yeah, yeah
All now

[Verse 1: Ghetts]
All now, been going all-out
All hours of the night when I crawl out (ninja)
Fuck them niggas, they're all mouth
I pulled up, then I pulled out
Ceasefire? When? 3:15? Nah
Ring ring, school's out
You're hot-headed, cool down
Stop bredding, we're cool now (BUCK-I!)
A nigga never had a tool out (BUCK-I!)
You ain't never had a real nigga fall out
You ain't never forgotten your something in your yard
And turned around five minutes after you walked out (BUCK-I!)
The tings man think, you ain't thought 'bout
The tings man link, you can't call round
I sink man's ship, let 'em all drown
Big man ting when I walk round

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
They say it's my time
They don't know I'm constant
I've been firing all my life
Murders on my conscience
See, I can give you hype
Or I can give you problems
But I'd rather give you dimes
It's how I count my losses
I've been on the ground, I've been in the town we live
I've been on the prowl, I've been with an ounce of piff
A flipper, yeah, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
You know how I know you ain't a winner?
You probably don't finish all your dinner
I'm the type of nigga that you pick up when you pick up
Cause you're a poster boy, the hood will get you pin up
Yeah, I'm rolling, boy, I'm only getting bigger
O2's in my sights, I can reach it
I re-up any time I'm on a remix
I could probably make a million for features
All now, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Mercston]
Nuff times I
Gotta escape to get my mind right
In the limelight
The light can be too bright for your eyesight
But I'm ready for the flash
Anytime that I pull up inna my ride
I'm the man right now
See your girlfriend giving me the side eye

(I'm the man right now
See your girlfriend giving me the side eye)

[Verse 3: Scorcher]
I heard dem bwoy dere wan' light me up
But nothing they can say can't frighten us
Cuh dem bwoy dere all talk, dem bwoy dere all talk
And me and Mercs chatting on the Lyca, you know it ain't small talk
[?] tried to get a reload
I was stressed out, can I get a reload?
If I switch onto blow for a minute
I skip on a riddim with six nigga
I bet that somebody rewrote
Cuh I'm like that, buss mic like that
Ghost for a couple of months, then come right back
Fucking hell
You're looking at a bloodclart titan
Brudda with the lightning
Might see your wife for a side ting
Getting better with age
Told man already, fuck it, I'mma tell 'em again
It's like hip-hop, garage, you choose but you news
Could've bought a run-around, but I bought new shoes
Now let me go acca for these new youts
Now you faggots know who's who

[Verse 4: Mercston]
Yeah, end the year with a remix, three features
Really, we should've had an album, I proper deeped it
Shout Chip for the verse, ripped it to pieces
Cut the beat, man are Mr Miyagi teachers
They all wanna Daniel LaRusso
I still Rolex and Hublot
The first one I ever had, it was two-tone
Now two separate two-tones
And I went bloodclart bad in a tune
The Fire in the Booth was the proof
I had on a Paul Smith leather jacket in the room
When the grime come on, I set fire to the roof
Might finish your bacon, don't rasta rasta
'Bout they eat bacon
The first tune we had together was "Used to Be"
Still I'm with the girl from "Used to Be"
I'm the man right now, see your girlfriend giving me the side eye
She look [?] yeah
I see a couple girls up there on a lev with their Snapchat open
So I had to spin her round cuh manamanaman can't go down there
