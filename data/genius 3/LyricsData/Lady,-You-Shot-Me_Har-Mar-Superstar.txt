[Chorus]
Lady, you shot me
On top of all the tears you brought me
You broke my one rule
You treated me cruel

Now I lay bleeding
It's just your love that I'm needing
What else can I do, if you are untrue

[Verse]
I'll get back in line
Behind the other guys
There's a chance you'll let me
Back into your heart
Never again apart
And you won't forget me

I don't think I've got
The will to take another shot
But your words, they pierce me

All my friends tell me to accept the end
But my mind won't let me

So please tell me now
If you think you'll mess around
Cuz I know you'll kill me
If you still make me your clown

[Chorus]
Lady, you shot me
All the tears you brought me
You broke my one rule now
You treated me cruel now

Now I lay bleeding
It's just your love that I'm needing
What else can I do now
If you are untrue?

Now I lay bleeding
All the tears you brought me
You broke my one rule yeah
You treated me so cruel

Lady, you shot me
On top of all the tears you brought me
Oh you broke my one rule yeah
You treated me so cruel

Oh yeah now I lay bleeding
All your love I'm needing
What else can I do now
If you are untrue?
