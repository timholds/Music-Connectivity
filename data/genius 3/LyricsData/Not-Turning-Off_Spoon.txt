[Verse 1]
She's gone in a word and tanked up
And I can't sleep at all, I can't sleep at all
She's gone in a word, the ephedrine
Got caught half-way down, the pretty anti-ground
Don't want to miss such an american scene
And I said to myself I'm not turning off
I said to myself I'm not turning off
And I said to myself I'm not turning off
And I said to myself I'm not turning off

[Chorus]
Oh, honey, oh, please, it's just a machine
Oh, honey, please, it's just a machine
Oh, honey, oh, please, it's just a machine[x2]

[Verse 2]
There's something about, you're up late
Your can tastes like tin aluminum
There's something about, I'm not the only one
That can't sleep at all, that can't sleep at all
And I don't want to miss such an american scene
And I said to myself I'm not turning off
I said to myself I'm not turning
Well, I said to myself I'm not turning off
And I said to myself I'm not turning off

[Bridge
So connect, connect, connect, connect to me
Connect, connect, connect, connect to me

[Outro/Chorus]
Oh, honey, oh, please, it's just a machine[x4]
It's just a machine
