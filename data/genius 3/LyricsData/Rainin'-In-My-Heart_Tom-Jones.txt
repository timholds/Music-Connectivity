Rainin' in my heart
Since we've been apart
I know I was wrong
Darling please come on home

You got me cryin'
About to lose my mind
Don't let me cry in vain
Try my love just once again

[instrumental]

Now honey I need your love
And darling you know why
So if you just come on back home
There'd be no need for me and cry

Rainin' in my heart
Since we've been apart
I know I was wrong
Darling please come on home

Rainin' in my heart...
