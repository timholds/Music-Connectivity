No more rainy days
You brought back the joy and I thank you baby, thank you baby
No more rainy days
You brought back the sun and I thank you baby, thank you baby

I was feelin empty until you came and filled me
Of what's that thang you put on me, what-what
I just can't shake it off me, I think that I'm addicted
Can't break away, I'm trippin on and on

No more rainy days
You brought back the joy and I thank you baby, thank you baby
No more rainy days
You brought back the sun and I thank you baby, thank you baby

I thought I'd never trust again, all the pain he put me in
Felt like I would die-die-die-die-die
Then you brought new life to me, took away the ugly
Just by the way you touch me, I'm in love

No more rainy days
You brought back the joy and I thank you baby, thank you baby
No more rainy days
You brought back the sun and I thank you baby, thank you baby

Now that I found love
I won't cry no more
Rainy days are gone
Since you came along, along

No more rainy days
You brought back the joy and I thank you baby, thank you baby
No more rainy days
You brought back the sun and I thank you baby, thank you baby
