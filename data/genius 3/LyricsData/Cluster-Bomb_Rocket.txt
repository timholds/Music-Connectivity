[Intro: Rocket]
Yeah
OK

[Hook: Rocket]
Yo, been around the block but I'm still here
Nowadays man ah see things so clear
Only my team that I keep near
(Wah gwan, fam?) Yes, my don
Me and you know we ain't new like that
Old school, man ah don't move like that
So dem ones hype on their twos like that
Yo, been around the block but I'm still here
Nowadays man ah see things so clear
Only my team that I keep near
(Wah gwan, fam?) Yes, my don
Me and you know we ain't new like that
Old school, man ah don't move like that
So dem ones hype on their twos like that

[Verse 1: Tee]
Yo, yeah the tank gets cramped, might run out of room, but
Dun know, can't run out of tunes
More time, might run out of food
But you dun know, can't run out of juice
Can't run out of drinks, though we going to the shop
Any time man run out of booze
So grab an Artois, a glass and go hard
And let's go hard for all of the ones that can't
All the ones that parred
All the ones that didn't
All the ones that said man couldn't
Said man should but hoped man wouldn't
Thought was there but really wasn't
Cleared the air, now I'm like "good riddance"
Let's take shots with the ones still there
And take notes from anyone that isn't
(You, you, you, you)

[Verse 2: Scorcher]
(You get me, Rocks?)
Twos my man on what?
Buss my man on where?
Bring my man on who?
You ain't done shit for me
And I was selfish, I ain't do shit for you
Yeah, it's like that, brudda
Cause I don't know you like that, brudda
And yeah, we went school like that
But let's be honest, you was a dickhead with the latest crep
You really wasn't cool like that
I've been around the block and you weren't on it
And if it was and it popped off, you weren't on it
You was a pussy in infant's, primary
Secondary and your first college
And now you wanna act brand new La Roux
Cuh you made a little P, now you think you're a G
Mind I don't backhand bare truth in you, dickhead

[Break: Rocket]
Dem ones
Dem ones
You know
Dem one dere
Yeah, yo

[Verse 3: Rocket]
Who's there when you need 'em?
Who's there when you can't feed 'em?
How do you know if you should lose 'em or keep 'em?
People come in small print, sometimes I can't read 'em
As season to season passes
You don't only lose leaves and grasses
Gotta take care of the roots, build foundations
Had to plant seeds in vases
Too many people concerned with
How many seats are filled up with arses, who's been charting
I don't watch buzz, who's been grafting?
Arts and crafts and you ain't crafting
It's all relevant
You can sleep on man but I'm done with the sedatives
Laid my sediment, paid my dues
Now I've come back for the severance, nah, mate
Trust ain't easy to come by
Guts ain't easy to muster
Ain't got enough fucks left in my system to give them
To people who hate you but act like they love ya
Think they're above ya, yeah?
Nah mate, man are General Custer
I'm 'bout to pillage and plunder, drop bare bombs
So you better get ready for a cluster, baow
