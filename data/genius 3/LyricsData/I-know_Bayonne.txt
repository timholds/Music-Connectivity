I know
I know

I know
I have something
For your minds
Oh

Flyin' home
White eyes
My little time zone

You can take a stand
When you wanna make it right
Constantly mistaken that I can't say why enough

Chasing after something that I can leave behind
Never stop my dreaming' but she looks like a go-getter

I see whats on her mind
I see it all the time

Belong
Her Song
And I understand I'm not
Finding tones
Eyes closed
What if everybody won?

I take your hands and you can take my mind
Certainly creative but I know we can do better
Oh-oh
Slipping onto something that I can redefine
Feeling more creative but I can't stay high enough
Oh-Oh
Yeah
I know what's on your mind
I think I got her high
