I'm not some c'mon strong, Romeo cowboy

Oh, go on an' do your thing
She's just a line away from fallin'

Goin' wild, an' honky-tonkin'...
Whiskey, do my talkin'

Goin' wild, an' honky-tonkin'...

Whiskey, do my talkin'
Say all the things I can't
Here's to you, my hundred proof friend

She's just a line away from fallin'
Goin' wild, an' honky-tonkin'...
Whiskey, do my talkin'

Oh, I
