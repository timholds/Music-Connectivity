[Verse 1]
I’m called and I’m chosen
Forgiven and redeemed
I am justified and qualified
I am loved by the king
My past is behind me
It’s a testimony now
Of someone who was so lost
But now I have been found

[Chorus]
And only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it

[Verse 2]
He loves everybody
Even those who others hate
He’s near to the brokenhearted
And he cares about their pain
He wants us to be better
But he accepts us as we are
He gives new life to those who ask
And perfects us with his love

[Chorus]
And only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it

[Bridge]
His mercy found me
His love, it saved me
His power changed me
His grace sustains me
His mercy found me
His love, it saved me
His power changed me
His grace sustains me

[Chorus]
And only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it

[Bridge]
His mercy found me
His love, it saved me
His power changed me
His grace sustains me

His mercy found me
His love, it saved me
His power changed me
His grace sustains me

[Chorus]
And only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it

And only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it

[Bridge]
His mercy found me
His love, it saved me
His power changed me
His grace sustains me

His mercy found me
His love, it saved me
His power changed me
His grace sustains me

His mercy found me
His love, it saved me
His power changed me
His grace sustains me

And only Jesus did it
Only Jesus did it
