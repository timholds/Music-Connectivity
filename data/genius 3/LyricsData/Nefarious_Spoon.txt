[Verse 1]
She was smoking up all his cigarettes
And putting them out in his hand
She said that, You think this hurts now, kid
Well, just wait until later, man

[Bridge]
This is fucking torture to me
It's fucking torture

[Chorus 1]
Nefarious, nefarious
It's enough to have to meet you
Oh, nefarious, nefarious
And there's nothing that could reach you

[Verse 2]
What's good, what's not so good?
Sometimes it's hard for her tell
And what's good, what's not so good?
Sometime it's hard
When she knows you so well
And when she knows you so well

[Chorus 2]
And now your teeth are red
And there's a little bit about you
I don't want to know
And now your teeth are all red
There's a little bit about you
I don't want to know

[Verse 3]
But when there's something
That wants this much to happen
There's no need to be alarmed
But I'm not so sure
If I want to get in that car
Because I caught you cheating
And caulking your chin

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]

[Outro]
And you're tearing me apart
Tearing me apart
It's enough to have to meet you
