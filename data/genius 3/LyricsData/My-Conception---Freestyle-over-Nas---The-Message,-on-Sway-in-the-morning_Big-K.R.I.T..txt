[Verse 1]
My conception
I've been different and eclectic
I've done more than what's expected, that’s in a world with no perspective
That’s in a time with no perception
I made do with the lesson, the one or twos or the lesser
Had 25s on the dresser
Yessir'
Huh, huh
I'm talkin' lighters, no need for biters, and reminiscin'
I gave you knowledge they sold to me, hope you paid attention
That first class rank for me doe
Is to make eye contact with egos
That feel like, we don't be-long
Like looking at a ticket that make me, be gone
Fuck it I earned this shit here, I'm upgrading
I was comfy in my seat and you just made it
You was asking for a blanket I'm already faded
Jack and coke for all my niggas, that didn’t make it
Ough'
To the flight that I'm on
Mansion big enough for me and mine, the sight that I'm on
I'm a kid in the candy store, despite that I'm grown
Yeah
When it comes to this Rap shit
A lot of Whatchamacallits, Twixin', and snap quick
I guess the hunger for fame will make you back-flip
So while they’re Snicker[ing] and bickering, I know my worth
Like that last peppermint in my granny's purse
Or like a warm shoulder when I used to sleep in church
Or what I was destined to be as soon as my birth, king


[Verse 2]
So as far as I'm concerned, fuck these haters for life
They the type to fuck a hoe and probably pay for it twice
Take her out, ate her out, and after, got her a wipe
You only get a thumbs up when niggas have to go swipe
Past your shit
Now ask yourself if this what you want
Old half-ass niggas always do, but they don't
I really hate freestyling, feel like I'm tap dancing
But I'm Gregory Hines, I play the renaissance manner
Peeping my enemies
The story of a king, gets to sit by the river and watch 'em flow downstream
The art of war is never sleep with your stories
And bear arms, no bare palms, get porridge
I'm a southern motherfucker flip a east-coast flow
I'm the product of the slave that couldn't leave my coast
You got me fucked up, to think that you’re better
You couldn't expose a G if you Louis'd the letters
C.K.s, rang out
I'm a wolf with my fangs out
Hold up, Sway, I heard this where the sheep hang out
It's strange now
But stranger things still happen
In this upside down world we in, I'm 'bout that action
Talkin' seven, 7-Elevens, couldn't stop me
That's 539 one-times, copy
I seen it
I'm the Albert Einstein of Rap, genius
Mc squared most MC's yeah, I guess that's fair since everybody's god flow
I'm a titan, this rap shit I'm killing god's though
On Mount Olympus, my pimpsman-shit is too pimping
You hesitating, I'm in your bitch crib, faded on the furniture you bought her
Player, I see ya
You fooled your main lady, but this shit IKEA
Fuck your couch nigga
I treat a pussy like it’s been through a drout, nigga
I flood the scene hit the showers then I’m out, nigga
Back to the benjis and money I'm spending
Play take the water, but twist me a lemon
Ain't talking social when a nigga trendin'
Why not ball when you come from humble beginnings?
Shiat', I dunk on Jordan
And tell Spike if he need acres shorty I got 40
In the South
And with the rest I put some golds in my mouth
Invisible, said it with the diamonds when I smile
Cause' Money Talk, word to Chris Tucker
Cause' one Friday ain't enough, bitch I need another
Hold up
