[Verse 1]
If only there could be another way to do this
Cause it feels like murder to put your heart through this
I know I always said that I could never hurt you
Well, this is the very, very last time I'm ever going to

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too
Said, I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too

[Chorus]
Eventually
Eventually

[Verse 2]
Wish I could turn you back into a stranger
'Cause if I was never in your life, you wouldn't have to change it

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too
Said, I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too

[Chorus]
Eventually
Eventually

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know just what I've got to do
And it's got to be soon
'Cause I know that I'll be happier
And I know you will, too

[Chorus]
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
Eventually
