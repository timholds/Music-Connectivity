[Verse 1]
Postpone it and tell it life's got you
Take time off, tell them someone needs you
And tell them all work does is bides you a year
Before you get out of here

[Pre-Chorus]
To a place that don't sleep
And the pubs don't shut early
And your ex will never call
Never call

[Chorus]
From the minute you regret it
To the minute that you let it go
To the minute you get fed up
Trying to please everyone
And the minute you forget that
You can pick it up like nothing's changed
And you feel like it all starts falling
And you feels like your luck need changing
Yes, I'll be there when it all falls

[Verse 2]
Sleep through all the rigmarole
Your roommates cause every time they fall
And tell them all love does is bides you a year
Before you get out of here

[Pre-Chorus]
To a place that don't sleep
And the pubs won't shut early
And your ex will never call
Never call

[Chorus]
From the minute you regret it
To the minute that you let it go
To the minute you get fed up
Trying to please everyone
And the minute you forget that
You can pick it up like nothing's changed
And you feel like it all starts falling
And you feels like your luck need changing
Yes, I'll be there when it all falls

[Bridge]
And things were never looking up
And we were brought up not to notice
And from the minute you regret it to the minute you let it go

[Outro]
And you feel like it all starts falling
And you feels like your luck need changing
Yes, I'll be there when it all falls
And you feel like it all starts falling
And you feels like your luck need changing
Yes, I'll be there when it all falls
