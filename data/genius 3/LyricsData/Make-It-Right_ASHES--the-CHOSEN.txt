Chorus:
Paid with my blood to get up out of there
Feel like somebody must’ve heard my prayers
I’m sure things’ll be aite (*Be aite)
...If not then I’ma make it right
(I’m sure that things will be aite)
(I’m a  make it right)

Verse 1:
Living in the city of angels acting devilish
It gets hot if you cold so I’m told
So I cherish it…
...No cosigns
Just opposition
Didn’t come for friends
Just competition
And to fuck shit up
With these compositions
Pen mighty
Sword heavy
Spit out rappers that wasn’t ready
When the hood love you
But the burbs get you
And the flows stupid
There goes the levee
These pretty girls with they daddy issues
Got niggas hate you that’s glad to diss you
Trade headshots for them backshots
Hear dreams break as that bed rocks
We here!

Chorus:
Paid with my blood to get up out of there
Feel like somebody must’ve heard my prayers
I’m sure things’ll be aite (*Be aite)
...If not then I’ma make it right
(I’m sure that things will be aite)
(I’m a  make it right)

Verse 2:
Gottdamn my nigga
I'm the man my nigga
Told my team back then I wasn't playing my nigga
Been King Kong on these theme songs
With the Pyrex
My team strong
That was ‘96
On some grimy shit
When my man’s and them used to slide me bricks
Corner culture kept me fly to chicks
But the guilt was heavy in my mind like SHIT
EBTs
And them crack friends
That dirty money come back clean
Meant fresh Jordy’s
School clothes
Can't blame children that’s movin “O”s?
Can’t blame niggas that want that dough?
Air Force Ones flew me out of there
That Raiders bomber with the black skully
Low cut Caesar with the flyest gear
My climate there
With no guidance there
How climb the highest was my mind out there
Kitchen looking like a Science Fair
No shyness there
We surviving here
(*Still) Left the corner like I never missed it
Open Bibles and Lotto tickets
Absent fathers and Grandma kisses
I made it out
But the cycle’s vicious
We here!

Chorus:
Paid with my blood to get up out of there
Feel like somebody must’ve heard my prayers
I’m sure things’ll be aite (*Be aite)
...If not then I’ma make it right
(I’m sure that things will be aite)
(I’m a  make it right)
Paid with my blood to get up out of there
Feel like somebody must’ve heard my prayers
I’m sure things’ll be aite (*Be aite)
...If not then I’ma make it right
(I’m sure that things will be aite)
(I’m a  make it right)
