(We can make love in my bedroom)
We can make love in the bedroom
(Whoa)
On the floor, top of my water bed
Let me run my fingers
(We could do it baby)
Through your hair
(Oh baby in the shower)
And both of our bodies drippin' wet
I love it when you touch all over me
Oh, I love it when you caress me
Ooh, baby
(Make out on the patio)
Outside, in broad daylight
(Ooh, yeah)
Or late at night
(Ooh, yeah)
It doesn't matter where we go
(It doesn't matter baby)
We can do it anywhere
(Anywhere)
Anywhere...
Anywhere...
Anywhere...
