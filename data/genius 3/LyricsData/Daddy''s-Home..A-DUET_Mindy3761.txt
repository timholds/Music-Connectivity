I want two eggs over easy hash browns country ham
Grits biscuits red eyed gravy a meal fit for a man
So why is it that every time when I work on the go
All I get on my plate is butter and burnt toast?

(HER)
Really baby, that's what you want well let me tell you now
See those 3 babies in dirty diapers and the one that just ran out
WE got another in the tub and two fighting over there
So if you want a meal for a man that fix it for yourself

(HIM)
