[Verse 1: Trilla]

Trilla Jermaine Trilloski
She came to say howdy
She liked the way I parked up the Audi
Telling me that she knows everything about me
And she’s been banging out my cd loudly
All because I make the flows nasty
I ain't Ken, I ain't looking for no Barbie
But I told her she can be my Knight Rider
If she’s speaking Panjabi

Mera soniay alag jai style ni , Audi gadi rukhi ghaint hai mobile ne
Jutho janda meah cluba thoora pat da , loha menay England poora jatt da x2
(English)
I have got style, which is different to everyone else in a unique way; I have an Audi car and a top mobile phone x2
When I enter the club I cause havoc and the whole club bows down to the Jatt

[Verse 2: Lexeye]
What you know about Lex E.Y.E
First class MC from COV
Roll around in my City in a Audi
Trips overseas with Panjabi MC
Not a lot, hear wot I’m lava hot
With more style then an oxford street shop
Offlicence make, make the beat roc
Can't stop won’t stop till we reach the top

[Verse 3: Projay]
Back with a new look, back with a new hook
Back in Q7 40inch rim truck
Get profit off it, money I got it
CA bottles everyday I pop it
Stop it, floss that Hollywood class
It’s the blackberry flyboy, KING OF THE MARKET
We get Arab currency, multiple cheques
From Bahrain to New York, ripping up sets

Sunlay churai ne thou sunny jatt de , jinay dekh bottle ne thou apay datt patt de
Sunlay churai ne thou sunny jatt de , jinay dekh bottle ne thou apay datt patt de
Othe sukhi nall yari goodi ambar a deh chari , dilah uve mehl ne

Now that you have heard the rise off Sunny J , the bottle of your liquor opens itself when you see me
Now that you have heard the rise off Sunny J , the bottle of your liquor opens itself when you see me
I am great friends with Sukhi and we fly our planes together and have no malice in our hearts

[Verse 4: Trilla]
She said I look sexy
When she saw me wiz past in the S3 (Whoosh)
I’m in the club, glass never empty
Offlicence, PMC
We be popping champagne in the VIP
Got afew carrots in the new pinkie
Got a new wip coming in a few weeks
Plus 0121 out in the streets
