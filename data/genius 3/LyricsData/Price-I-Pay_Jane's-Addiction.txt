I always do the wrong thing
But for a very good reason
Always do it wrong
But it feels right
So forgive me now
And forgive me later
I'll pay you back
I always do the wrong thing
For a very good reason
Always do it wrong
But it feels right
I could have it, but I walked away
Now I won't miss out, not even one day!
What I lost off the line
I bring back all in my good time

There ain't no other way
Because this is
The price
It's the price
Always the price I pay

I see you, you're going places
So, let's get the hell out of here!
I'm a big liver man at the table
I got my long c*** drawn
I'm able to lay you out!

There ain't no other way
Because this is
The price
It's the price
Always the price I pay

Always having a good time
Always searchin' for more
Flying now
Paying later
I'm flyin' now!

I'm layin' in a bath of hot water
Hot water always my case
Finally nothing to say
Just put the cloth right over my face

There ain't no other way
Because this is
The price
It's the price

Always the price I pay
I got to thrust it out!
The price that I pay
I got to get it out!

Always
Always the price that I pay
