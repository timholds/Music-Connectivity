[Intro]
I am the devil
I am the devil

[Strophe 1]
I am the devil
I'm pleasure and indulgence
I am the devil
I don't practice self-deceit
I am the devil
I made a vow to vengeance
I am the devil
I don't turn the other cheek

[Chorus]
We're marching into sunset
From heaven into hell
We wanna feel the fire burning
A place to dwell
We're marching into sunset
From day into the night
We wanna feel the fire burning
I am I am I am the devil
I am god
I am the light
I am the moth

[Strophe 2]
I am the devil
I'm undefiled wisdom
I am the devil
I am all your so called sins
I am the devil
I'm just another animal
I am the devil
You'll be my witness when it all begins

[Chorus (x2)]
