I believe in never let my strip get hotter
Than something I can get out of, one that heats up on me
I told 'em this would be a one time dance
Meaning one time chance after I said that, oh
That's when he got close to me
All the other music stopped but the violin
Conversation, one dance, sip a bottle of the best
Now I'm asking myself, "What has he done to me?"
This can't turn into love, no
The rose petals were all in the air
Just might need that firetruck to come and get me
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Can't say I don't want it 'cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know if I'm going or coming
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Didn't have to know from your body put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale on me
Gotta call a cab if I don't need gonna have me
With every young stunna in the hood wanna have me
Uh, so much of him I couldn't surrender
'Cause I know where this could end up
And with that right now I can't play
I know I drive him loco but that's just the way
You make a mama's hips go
This can't turn into love, no
The rose petals were all in the air
Just might need that firetruck to come and get me
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Can't say I don't want it 'cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know if I'm going or coming
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Feeling nothing normal from your body put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale on me
That's why I fly [Incomprehensible]
Or that deuce deuce chrome el Camino
Hope the world is really ready for some fly Latinos
We the chief like Babe Ruth and The Great Bambino
Now we didn't really come here to burn nobody
All I wanna do is drink and dance with shawty
There's a legend in the house, here to rock the party
You can toss, drink, blaze and like there's no tamari
Oops, I'm in my Maina with Carlos Santana
Oops, it's Ronnie Ray all day with J hot as a sauna
We in the building and we feelin' like a 100 degrees
I got a fly chicanita and she's stuntin' with me, so right here
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Can't say I don't want it, 'cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know if I'm going or coming
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Feeling nothing normal from your body put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale on me
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Can't say I don't want it 'cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know if I'm going or coming
