It's 3 a.m
And I've been thinking
What we're all about
I gotta tell you
I'm halfway
Between hope and doubt
Am I goin' overboard
Pushing just a little too hard
Don't want to give it all away
But hey

I admit to being afraid
Falling hard and being played
My heart is saying just let go
But I don't know

[Chorus:]
Should I fall
Open up and give it all
Should I fall
Should I fall
Don't know what I'll do
Should I fall for you

There's a part of me
Saying take a chance
Tell you everything
Then the other side
Says be cool
Hold back something
I'm not into playing games
I'm hoping that you feel the same
I'd like to get close tonight
But only if it's right
Won't somebody tell me how
I'm supposed to hold back now
Am I past the point of saying
Let's wait?

[Chorus:]
Should I fall
Open up and give it all
Should I fall
Should I fall
What I'll do when it all falls through
Should I fall for you

Mmm, Should I fall for you? Mmm..

I've been holding back so long
What I feel can't be wrong
Once we start it'll be too late
And love will carry us away
Should I fall for you baby
And you know you know it's true

[Chorus:]
Should I fall
Should I fall for you?
Should I fall for you baby?
Should I fall
Tell me should I, what I do when it all comes through
Should I fall for you, Oh
Don't know what I'll do

You got me going crazy
'Cause I'm falling for you baby
And I don't know what to do
What happens if it all falls through

Should I fall, should I fall
Open up and give it all
Should I fall, don't know what I'll do
Should I fall for you
Should I fall for you
