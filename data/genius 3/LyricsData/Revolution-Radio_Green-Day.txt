[Verse 1]
Scream, with your hands up in the sky
Like you want to testify
For the life that's been deleted
Sing, like a rebel's lullaby
Under the stars and stripes
For the lost souls that were cheated
We will be seen but not be heard

[Chorus]
We are Revolution Radio
Operation 'No Control'
And the headline 'My love's bullet proof'
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline 'Legalize the truth'

[Verse 2]
Give me rage, like thereâ€™s tear gas in the crowd
Do you wanna live out loud?
But the air is barely breathing
Rise of the slums to the obsolete
The dawn of the new airwaves for the anti-social media

[Chorus]
We are Revolution Radio
Operation 'No Control'
And the headline 'My love's bullet proof'
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline 'Legalize the truth'

[Bridge]
We will be seen but not be heard
We are the songs of the disturbed

[Chorus - Revised]
We are Revolution Radio
Operation 'No Control'
And the headline 'My love's bullet proof'
Give me cherry bombs and gasoline
Debutantes in surgery
And the headline 'Legalize the truth'
