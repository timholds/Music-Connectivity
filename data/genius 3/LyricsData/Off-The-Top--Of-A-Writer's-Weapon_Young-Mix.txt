[Verse1: Young Mix]

They say that the priming is the scoring
Good living comes from a vibing or a sporting
My advice lengths the time of the recording
A black man's succuess is if he's rhyming, or he's soaring
The gossip is just nonsense so be honest with yourself and never lose your concious upon it
A comment is neutronic, it moves like sonic, and spreads like Bubonic for a being who bonds it
Technally the tectonics could summon bombings of the content including the dishonors and dodging
My project is to dissect the problems of a contest, to see if we can make it without feeling a dawnless
Horizon
Is a college worth providing, if every single day the hood is hearing sirens
If a fire will make you move then ignite it
This is M.I.X with the weapon of my writing
