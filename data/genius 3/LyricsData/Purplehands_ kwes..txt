Walking in the park
Chucking bread to swans
Hearing them honk
Bucket in one hand
Underneath the udder
'till the cows come home
We're loving one another
Whilst we pull the berries from the tree
Butterflies are crawling all over me
They velcro me all through and through
Into a walking bluebell just for you
Red and blue makes purple
Crop circles bearing the fruits of our love. [x4]
