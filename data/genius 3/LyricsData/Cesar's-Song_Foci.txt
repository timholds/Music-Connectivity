Verse 1
They say when it rains it pours coming from the clouds
To replenish the grounds
You still making roots grow so look at me now
How you held me down since we were yay high
You kept me level right
You moved like fluid guy
My cup never dry
Yea you seen me cry
And you seen me lie
But you never tried to judge me, that’s who you were
Always above me but you never ever would
Hold it over me before the days of Foothills
During Pop Warner me with speed us learning skills
Dreams of All-Star league could've paid our bills
Wish you Chris Rix'd me Amat could take me still

Chorus
Pain still remains as we stray away from our sorrow
An hourglass holds the sands of time of which we have borrowed
Some say it is thy will and some refuse to ever follow
Someday we'll breathe for today and tomorrow

Verse 2
How you doin' man
It's been a long time
It's been a long climb
Up on a long vine
But all week it’s been pouring raining from the sky
They say it only happens when the heavens cry
...
And when the tears fall from your mother’s eye's
To keep her up, your sister brother father try
For we to share in pain only understates the ways
For us to be thankful, for what we have today
For what we have lost is within the heaven's gain
Forgive me for wanting you so selfish in the same, ways
Like how we were kids and we always played
Could it all be so simple back in the day

Chorus
Pain still remains as we stray away from our sorrow
An hourglass holds the sands of time of which we have borrowed
Some say it is thy will and some refuse to ever follow
Someday we'll breathe for today and tomorrow

B Section
We all thought the temper from the G in me
Would be what made me the o-n-e

Verse 3
Yes the good die young so I remain to misbehave
Who am I kidding I’m reformed you made my edges straight
That day in court somehow you made me say those words
Wrote only hours prior to the cause this pain deserves
In so many different ways you were controlling me
My mind thoughts actions to have the nerves to be
...
You always had faith in my music and my words
Ideas you had so I listened and I heard
But the other guy your mom told me leave alone
No show to the trial memorial funeral
It's hard to grasp this feeling in myself
It’s hard to hold back my mind hasn't dealt
Its so hard to withstand how it kills my health
Emotional rollercoaster lays in stealth
Counting the days and months to years and how we feel
We all have emotions that lie to us still
Inanimate in death some say God's will
Is it any different when intent was ill
If the red slayer think he slays
Or if the slain think he is slain
They know not well the subtle ways
I keep and pass and turn again

Chorus
Pain still remains as we stray away from our sorrow
An hourglass holds the sands of time of which we have borrowed
Some say it is thy will and some refuse to ever follow
Someday we'll breathe for today and tomorrow
