[Hook]
I don't know why but I won't ever bar
Three times a week I go to a bar
I keep some money inside a gold bar
The bar was low so I lift the bar
Anytime I got too much on that's a par
Lime on top of shots at the bar
I know you weren't sure if I would go far
(Are you ready?)

[Verse 1: Wiley]
I told 'em I came from the everyday struggle
Now I'm living the life, I'm like "Drink, dance, bubbles"
It's a pagan free zone, stay in the G zone
When you was on two-tone, I was on three-tone
I don't wanna war every day 'cause I'm better than that
Giving it scenes when I step on the track
Lost my real spark, now you see me getting it back
I must admit, I feel ready, no more setting me back
I got the fire for ya, 22's 23's, got the tyres for ya
Sick riddims, spin 'em round like alloys
You hear my riddims flyin' through your Macs and your tannoys
You hear my lyrics fire through your Macs and your tannoys
I know where the paper is, I know where go-getters are
That's why you see me with my brothers on a better path
I've got better bars, I'm [?] of bars, I'm sick of bars, I'm the king of bars

[Hook]
I don't know why but I won't ever bar
Three times a week I go to a bar
I keep some money inside a gold bar
The bar was low so I lift the bar
Anytime I got too much on that's a par
Lime on top of shots at the bar
I know you weren't sure if I would go far

[Verse 2: Scratchy]
Start from scratch, forget the charts
Run up on me? I'm sorry, you can't
Warrior charge, warrior charge (ye ye)
I spit bars, I don't throw darts - them type of games, I don't take part
Man smokes lemon, man smokes [?]
Ain't got a [?], got a rack, it's a blast from the past
Made the verse then mixed the parts
Five cards laid down on the tables, still I can't see no hearts
Don't say nothin' when you see me walk past
We spot a dog there always on guard
Might switch it up, start spitting in yards'
Always getting involved, you're too fast
Not from the same place but worlds apart
If you don't want to see the end don't start

[Hook]
I don't know why but I won't ever bar
Three times a week I go to a bar
I keep some money inside a gold bar
The bar was low so I lift the bar
Anytime I got too much on that's a par
Lime on top of shots at the bar
I know you weren't sure if I would go far

[Verse 3: D Double E]
(Oh my word, yo)
I spit a 16 bar, hot like tar
Soon be a star, get very far
Never gonna go away, permanent scar
Trust me this lyric is no joke lyric
When I draw my lyric
Make your new lyric look very old like a no go lyric, a make no dough lyric
Can't match - if you think you can
Gonna draw for the war lyrics
Better go and get more lyrics, and make sure that they're your lyrics
There will never be a day when I spit poor lyrics
In war, draw 24 more lyrics
Spit like a Magnum .44 lyric
Hit you on the chest, leave you on the floor lyric
Next time never ignore war lyrics
Like heavy rain, yeah, I pour raw lyrics

[Hook]
I don't know why but I won't ever bar
Three times a week I go to a bar
I keep some money inside a gold bar
The bar was low so I lift the bar
Anytime I got too much on that's a par
Lime on top of shots at the bar
I know you weren't sure if I would go far

[Outro: Wiley]
Came in the game with a tenner for the subs
Save £60, go cut two dubs
Came in the game with a tenner for the subs
Save £60, go cut two dubs
BBK, all day, everyday, BBK, (ayy)
BBK, all day, everyday, BBK
We run the mic, Maximums on the CDJs
BBK (yeah!)
