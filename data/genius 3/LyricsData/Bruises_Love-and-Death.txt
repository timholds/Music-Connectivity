[Verse 1]
Hearing voices in your head
Hurting bruises spoken through their mouths again
Every letter breaks the skin
One by one the bruises find a way back in

They bleed you dry [x2]

[Hook]
Show us how to live
How do we forgive
Through the bitterness?
(How do we get there?)
Show us how to die
How to give our lives
Living sacrifice
(How do we get there?)

[Verse 2]
Many scars we try to hide
How much longer will we keep the pain alive?

They bleed you dry [x2]

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now that I gave you all of my heart
Why do they rip it apart?
Shattered and broken down again
Fix the pieces
The pieces...

[Hook]

[Outro]
Show us how to live; show us how to die
Show us how to give our lives
