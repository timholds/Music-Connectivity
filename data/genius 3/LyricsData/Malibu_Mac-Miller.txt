[Intro:]
That good times can be a trap
Oh yea?
Oh hell naw
Now I'm here
Check myself intro rehab
Yeah, um... I might die before I detox
You piece of shit
Now that's a bar
I'm gonna save that one for a little bit
Now let me come with something else, you feel me?

[Verse 1:]
Its Air Jordan on my flip-flops
And kill me now if I did it all for hip-hop
I might die before I detox
This ain't high-school, no little Asian I can cheat off
We keep chiefing while police watch
Loss in vibration sirens blowing up the weed spot
And Heisman hopefuls all growing up to be cops
Chasing after gangsters but they never find the G spot
I'm recording like I'll die tomorrow
At the rate I'm getting high, it'll be hard for me to find tomorrow
But I just pray that I'll survive tomorrow
As she cries in sorrow, she just needs some time to borrow
She'll be smiling by tomorrow
Everything will be so fine tomorrow
Put the white away, we can do some lines tomorrow
Come say hi tomorrow
(Hello)

[Interlude]
And I’ll be damned if this ain’t some shit
And I’ll be damned if this ain’t some shit
Here I am
Oh... I know you see me
Here I am
Yeah... and I'll be damned if this ain't some shit but here I am!

[Verse 2:]
I'm the only suicidal motherfucker with a smile on
Let's hold hands and sing the bible, that's a violent song
The high-strung, eyes-low, ride along
Everybody, grab a fucking number, this a dieathon
Oh I'm the bomb, literally back away, I'm the bomb
Let me get my lion on (growl)
85 grand get you a heavy ass wrist
They ain't killin' they just yellin', that's it
A deadly combination with that ecstasy sniff
On the phone probably yellin' at Rich
Say, double the money, please, double the money
Triple the problems, double the money
They was all laughing, wasn't that funny
I started fucking with drugs and now I'm a junkie
The U-S of A, I fuck with my country
But Uncle Sam could never teach me how to Dougie
I'm thinking till my brain pops
Spitting is a cake walk
I'm just a rapper, guess I'm sticking to my day job
Wiz getting faded, come and kick it at a bake shop
Everything is A-1, steak sauce

[Outro:]
Thank God
God Damn it
Thank God
Here I am and I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
Here I am and I'll be damned if this ain't some shit
