It's too far
It's too fast
It's too quick
It won't last

It's not right
But it's not wrong
There's no time
Move along

But I've come much too far
And I know what's in my heart
And I know what I feel
I can tell when it is real
My time has come

It's okay
Be afraid
It's alright
You just take that fear

Turn it in
To your strength
It's called life
And that's why we're here

Now I've come much too far
And I know what's in my heart
And I know what I feel
And this time I know it's real
My time has come

And like the road below me
I know I'll touch the sky above
A million footprints around me
Tell me it can be done
My time has come

Now I've come much too far
And I know what's in my heart
Cause I know what I feel
And this time I know it's real
My time has come

It's so close
It's been a long time comin'
It's here and now
And I know it'll last

It's so right
That it can't be wrong
Now's the time
For me to be strong

Now I've come much too far
And I know what's in my heart
And I know what I feel
And this time I know it's real
My time has come

I know that I just gotta keep movin' on
I know what's in my heart, my time has come

I know that I just gotta keep movin' on
I know what's in my heart, my time has come

I know that I just gotta keep movin' on
I know what's in my heart, I can feel it, my time has come

I know that I just gotta keep movin' on
I know what's in my heart, I can feel it, my time has come

I know that I just gotta keep movin' on
I know what's in my heart, I can feel it, my time has come

I know that I just gotta keep movin' on
I know what's in my heart, I can feel it, my time has come

My time has come oh oh oh
