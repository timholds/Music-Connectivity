I broke your heart dear
I was untrue
And now I've lost you
What can I do?

I hope you're happy baby
For I'll get by
Too late to worry (too late to worry)
Too blue to cry. (too blue to cry.)

Our love has ended
You say we're through
You found a new love
And he's so good to you

I'll always love you baby
As days go by
It's too late to worry
I'm too blue to cry

I hope you're happy baby
For I'll get by
It's too late to worry
I'm too blue to cry... (too blue to cry...)
