[U-GO]
I fell in love with bands, baby
Look at the way that I count it!
Money fallin' out my hands, baby
Dammit, I think I miscounted
Diamonds drippin' like a fountain
Keep some real niggas 'round me
Lot of niggas say they one hundred
Sorry I think you miscounted

All of this money surround me
They cheering so loudly (Yeah)
All of these women surround me
Back then, used to clown me (Yeah, Yeah)
Now they tryna crown me

U-G-O, I got the flow, Get the dough
Cooking dope on the stove, Cut the O
Stay low, 'Boutta roll
Gotta go, Gotta smoke with a centerfold (Woahh)
The money gives me such a buzz
(The money do it man)
It's like the first time I fell in love
(Like the first time I fell in what what?)

Pockets on swole
Got all these bands
I don't know how I'ma count it
Told her slide through
Don't need the neck
I fuck with the way that she mount it
Hating ass niggas keep doubting me
My mom used to say that she proud of me
All of my niggas they're down for me
Know that they'll empty them rounds for me
These niggas got bold, so I'm coming in next
Ya mans run his mouth, so I'm droppin' him next
Ima pull up when my mans send a text
If we get jammed then I'm cutting a check (Woah!)
Not with the purpose
So please cut the flex (Goddam, Goddam)
