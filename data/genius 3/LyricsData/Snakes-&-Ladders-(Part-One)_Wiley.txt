[Verse]
Started on one and I gotta get to 100, yeah
Rolling the dice and I'm feeling lucky with numbers
Looking for a 6 but I start with a 4
Take the ladder to 14 now I'm climbing the board
2 spaces ahead and I see a snake on the floor
Thinking a 2 on the dice will send me straight to the floor
So I take another roll and I came out with a 5
19's all good and so I'm feeling alright
Hoping I do not get bitten up by the snake in my sight
Snakes are kinda like humans, I see the snake in your eye
So I try and avoid him, I stop him taking a bite
When I make it to the pinnacle and I'm taking a light
Next go, here we go, I just rolled a 7
Ended up at 25, no sting it's a blessing
I never knew this game was a lesson
Until I hit 31 I was in a studio session

[Outro]
