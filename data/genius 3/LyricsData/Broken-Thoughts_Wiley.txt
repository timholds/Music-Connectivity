[Verse 1:]
Since I pushed you away
I've been on the road to destruction
Fast life total reduction
Should've slowed down when I had a chance
I looked off track when I had a glance
When the bills and the board be paying
I can't hear what nobody's saying
I may as well live on my own
I feel trapped how I live on my phone
She asked me if I cheated and I did
I said no though I couldn't admit
Thought you don't know it don't hurt you
Till it starts travelling around the crib
Get a sunday skin like a ripster
Thinking what the other person did
Keep my feet on the ground
I don't wanna read through what I just found

[Hook:]
Wondering where the laughs went
She kept me on arms length
Wondering where the smiles were
Keepin tempted to dial her
Have I done something wrong to make her
Think that I was a heart breaker
I tried to look at life from all looks
These are my broken thoughts

[Verse 2:]
Our moves burning bridges
Learning limits, but to go past them
She knows I don't wanna argue
But I say pardon
As she walks into the garden
Now it's all silent treatment
Feels worse than violent treatment
When will it end
I text her phone when will it send
It's pending, iphone please stop pending
Then I realize that ain't worth the stress
She needs to clear her head
Even the bedroom's messy
She needs to clear her bed
I need to chill my beans, let her breath
Catch a likkle life on the scene
She always said I don't understand her
Cause my life is a dream
I see what she means

[Hook:]
Wondering where the laughs went
She kept me on arms length
Wondering where the smiles were
Keepin tempted to dial her
Have I done something wrong to make her
Think that I was a heart breaker
I tried to look at life from all looks
These are my broken thoughts

[Talking:]
At first I used to make her laugh
She was laughing
Well, the laughing's out the window
We used to go out in like the restaurants regular
Now we don't go at all
I'm saying like, what went wrong there
Really though

[Hook x2]
Wondering where the laughs went
She kept me on arms length
Wondering where the smiles were
Keepin tempted to dial her
Have I done something wrong to make her
Think that I was a heart breaker
I tried to look at life from all looks
These are my broken thoughts
