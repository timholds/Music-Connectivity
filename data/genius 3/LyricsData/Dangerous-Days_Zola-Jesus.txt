[Verse 1]
You're gonna win these odd days
You never stood to fight for your name
And I will be there unspoken, curious
You never were the one for us
You never were the one for us
And then I'd just lay here open

[Pre-Chorus]
On the floor, on the ground
On the stairs, on the way
On the floor, on the ground
On the stairs, on the way

[Chorus]
It’s a dark dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say
It’s a dark dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say

[Verse 2]
In the way, the way you hold yourself straight
You never were innocent
And then I just lay here frozen, curious
You never were the one for us
You never were the one for us
And then I'd just lay here open

[Pre-Chorus]
On the floor, on the ground
On the stairs, on the way
On the floor, on the ground
On the stairs, on the way

[Chorus]
It’s a dark dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say
It’s a dark dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say

[Bridge]
It’s dangerous
It’s dangerous to know
When it comes, are you gonna throw
Your bite into the game
Know what's right for your name
Lose your battle, it's all the same
It's dangerous
It's dangerous

[Chorus]
It’s a dark dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say
It’s a dark dark day
And it's dangerous to go
And listen what they say

Ooooooooooooh
Ooooooooooooh

[Outro]
It's dangerous (Ooooooooooooh)
It's dangerous
It's dangerous to go
It's dangerous
It's dangerous (Ooooooooooooh)
It's dangerous
It's dangerous (Ooooooooooooh)
It's dangerous
