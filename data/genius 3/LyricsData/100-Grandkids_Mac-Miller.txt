[Hook]
I made a promise to my mama
That I'll bless her with some grandkids, she can spoil them
Until then, I'm getting dollars, I'm just doing what I gotta
Can a man live? And it's all day (homie)
I'm a God, give the whole squad a job, get them all paid
Came a long way from all-state, yeah
Now we All-American, we All-American

[Verse]
I swear to God I put the hero in heroin, these flows kilos
I could sell snow to a ski slope
I could sell evil to the devil, nonbelievers to a temple
Shit, I could sell water to a speedboat
And these eyes is iconic, I went pro, made profit
Now I keep some dead faces in my pocket
Gettin' faded, I been stoned all week
But what's a God without a little OD? Just a G
Twisting my weed, easing my mind
Why you worry about me? Stop tripping, I'm fine
Swear these bitches done lost it lately
You put the ho in honest baby, so complicated
And I may be a little arrogant, I'm aware of it
I know (I know)
I got a problem, I'mma take care of it
Weight I'm carrying, gotta let it go (it won't hold me down no more)

[Hook]
I made a promise to my mama

Came a long way from all-state, yeah
Now we All-American, we All-American

[Post-Hook]
We ain't goin' nowhere
We ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now
Cause this rap shit's for life
We ain't goin' nowhere
We ain't goin' nowhere
We can't be stopped now
Cause this rap shit's for life

[Bridge]
Back then I had a dream
I'll get this money, man
I know, my life would change
Just need a hundred grand
Back then I had a dream

Just need a hundred grand
(Back when I first made a hundred grand...)

[Part 2: 100 Grand]

[Hook]
Yeah, back when I first made a hundred grand, thought I was the shit
When I first made a hundred grand, thought I was a king
When I first made a hundred grand, couldn't tell me nuttin
When I first made a hundred grand, made a hundred grand
(Let me get some money)

[Verse]
Yeah, okay, back then they used to call me little
But now I'm ridin' something clean in a coat made of armadillo
They haven't got the memo, they sayin' I'm the shit though
Tryna make it complicated when this shit is simple
Tell me what you wanna be, what your dreams is
A hundred G's in my jeans, I'm a genius
Each and everyday someone save me please
And get schooled, homie, change degrees
I'm the plug, what you need though? I'm goin' beast mode
I keep a freak, even when she underwater she can deep throat
(Wait what?) I made a mil' before I pay the bill
Cause  fools worried about a wave, I'm a Navy SEAL
Come with me, I can make your life change for real
Always had a dream of stuntin'
It ain't nothing unless we runnin' shit
Just a young motherfucker with a plan
Thought I was the man

[Hook]
Yeah, back when I first made a hundred grand, thought I was the shit
When I first made a hundred grand, thought I was a king
When I first made a hundred grand, couldn't tell me nuttin
When I first made a hundred grand, made a hundred grand
(Let me get some money)

[Outro: Elle Varner]
Let me get some money (Time flies)
Let me, let me get some money (Yeah, you know time flies)
I just need some shoes my niece  (Try to catch it)
Can we stop at Chipotle?
Let me get some money (Time flies)
Let me, let me get some money (yeah, you know time flies)
Let me get some money (Try to catch it)
Let me, let me get some money
