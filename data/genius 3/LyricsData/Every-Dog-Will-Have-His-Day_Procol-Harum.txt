You can give a dog a kicking
You can give a dog a bone
If you give your dog a kicking
Don't expect him to come home
You can call your dog a mongrel
You can call your dog a stray
Just remember in the end that

Every dog will have his day
Every dog will have his day Lord
Every dog will have his day
Just remember in the end that
Every dog will have his day

You can treat your dog with kindness
You can treat your dog with grace
Just remember in the end that
Every dog must know his place

Every dog must know who's master
Every dog must know who's boss
But whenever you run faster
It's the dog who ends up lost

Every puppy chews its balls Lord
Every puppy loves to scratch
When a puppy chews its balls Lord
Then you know you've met your match

Every dog will have his day Lord
Every dog will have his day
Just remember in the end that

Every dog just loves to play
Every dog just loves to play Lord
Every dog just loves to play
Just remember in the end that
Every dog will have his day
