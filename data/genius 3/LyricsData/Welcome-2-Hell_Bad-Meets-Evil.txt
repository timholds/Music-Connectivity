[Intro: Eminem]
Yeah, told you we'd be back
Welcome to Hell

[Verse 1: Eminem]
There's a switch, I flip, emotions cut off, so cold I done froze my butt off
And this ain't even the tip of the iceberg yet, it's like squirting a squirt gun in the ocean, fuck off
Other words I ain't put a dent in the game compared to the damage I've yet to do
As long as you still have feelings to hurt, I'll be around as long as you let me get to you
As long as I got two balls to palm, I'll be the bomb, you're just a false alarm
Get scant little piss-ants and see if I don't come along and stomp your farm
Thunder and lightning, rain, hail, sleet with a tornado's the kinda brainstorm I get
So when the wind starts blowing, shit talking 'bout going in, going insane is more like it
Wizard of words when he spits hazardous with it like a disastrous blizzard
So you better listen quick fast or miss it, yeah, go ahead little prick bastard diss it
But when you get hit with a sick-ass explicit flow don't ask how much of his passion is it
That goes in it, just know that all he knows is, that it's better to kick ass than kiss it
Dick Dastardly of audacity, mental capacity, unmatched it has to be
Stopped but it can't be, but man I can't just keep doing them like that or no one will rap with me
Except one, you asked who is it?

[Verse 2: Royce da 5’9”]
Guess who just came through the blast, you bitches
With the ratchet, the book of Matthew
A book of matches, lighting them under white linen
You 'bout to have to admit it
They pass you the mic, asked you to spit it
You got handed your own ass, your ass in your own hands
I'm sure they gon' laugh when you're going to the bathroom with it
Now with what would you come against us
Better be something with a big foot pedigree
Easily these are the reasons that we need to be in y'all prayers
Each region breeds some MCs that wanna be
Which means they wanna breathe our air
With these ideas, anybody thinking the game don't need
The Bad and the Evil regime
That's like saying that Bad Boy Piston team didn't need Isaiah

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Shit piss and bleed, this is a different breed of MCs
I swear, better beware, there's too much at stake
And to find someone this raw on a beat is rare
You kiss my ass and eat shit stains out my underwear that I don’t even wear

[Verse 4: Royce da 5’9”]
This gotta be no fair
It's like hitting the lottery, oh yeah
Who you know hotter? There gotta be no pair
Shotty that I got'll lobotomy your hair
Classic, smash it, smother it, read it and weep then
Perhaps you'll have no rebuttal, in fact, you seeing me
In this rapping is like saying Tila Tequila can sing like Jazmine Sullivan

[Verse 5: Eminem]
Back to bash your skull again
Push a bitch out the Aspen and tell her get the fuck outta Dodge
(Dodge Aspen) Shouldn't have to explain my metaphors
You has-beens are duller than color books that ain’t colored in
Second and third, fourth wind, got another wind
Here they come again, none other than
Bad and Evil also known as Saddam and Osama Bin
It's been a long time
But I bet that neither one of us have felt sicker than we do right now
And we only get iller with time
Me and Nickel fucking shit up on the dime so telling us to pipe down
Is like talking to a meth head
Bruce Willis on his death bed, last breath with an infection
Fighting it while he's watching internet porn
About to meet his death with an erection
My God, what I mean is David Carradine jacking his penis
In front of his tripod choking his own neck, what part you don't get?
I'm saying I'll die hard

[Verse 6: Royce da 5’9” & Eminem]
When you listening to my bars, nothing but the F-I-R-E
Coming out your iPod, we come up in a place
Chicks heads start spinning like motherfucking white walls
Got your mother sucking my balls
While we fuck each other we punch each other in the eyeballs
And I never say I'm so-rry, the 5’9” and the Fire Marshall
We spit with an intensity to shut shit down in the industry
Two different entities with a propensity
To put these N-U-Ts up inside of your fucking mouth

[Outro: Eminem]
Aw shit, stop it
Yo, welcome to the CD
