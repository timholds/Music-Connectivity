Don't know why I just can't work it out you just gave it away
Red letters on a mat pile up and what would you say
You rent a house you can't afford but daddy will pay
Tears running down your face it's time you got away
What about my aches and pains which leaves me drained
Tired of being there for you so what would you say
No question you sell you body parts to get your daily fix
Your family and you're so called friends would have to pick up the bits
What about my aches and pains which leaves me drained
Tired of being there for you so what would you say
Everything you do you do to harm by sticking that in your arm
Seeing you face down upon the floor I've got to get out the door
Don't care about anyone but yourself you must be full of hate
I feel I haven't helped that much you have fulfilled your fate
What about my aches and pains which leave me drained
You asked for my help once again I tried but you failed
