[Intro: Duke]
Real shit
Know what I'm talkin bout?

[Verse 1: Duke]
Just bought a pint of the whole team can sip
Nigga talk crazy get hit in the lip
I am so low key but im in the VIP
I didn't get sent I got it on my hip
Kickin that bitch and you know she's a rip

[Pre-Hook: Duke]
I'm not the player, i'm the coach
