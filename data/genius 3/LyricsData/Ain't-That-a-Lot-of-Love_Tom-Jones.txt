I know the desert can't hold all the love
That I feel in my heart for you, yeah
If I could spread it out across the sea
I know my love would cork it up
Ain't that a lot of love
For one heart to hold
If the bees only knew how sweet you are, Baby
They would seal up their honey comb
If the birds could hear how sweet your voice is
They would tighten up the song
Ain't that a lot of love
For one heart to hold
Your lips are so sweet
Honey, you're my every need
You got a smile so rare
A love like yours I just can't compare
Ain't that a lot of love
For one heart to hold
If the cook in the kitchen had a touch as hot as yours
They wouldn't need a fire
I can't think of a word that describes your love better
Than the sky above
Ain't that a lot of love
For one heart to hold
Yeah
Ain't that a lot of love
Ain't that a lot of love
For one heart to hold
One heart to hold
One heart to hold
One heart to hold
Ain't that a lot of love
Ain't that a lot of love
One heart to hold
One heart to hold
Ain't that a lot of love
Ain't that a lot of love
For one heart to hold
Oh that's a lot of love
Lot of love
Sounds like a lot of love
Sounds like a lot of love
For one heart to hold
For one heart to hold
