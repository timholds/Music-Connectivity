[Possessed]
Yo, we get the ball rolling like Indiana Jones
So much willpower I’m lifting Atlas stones with fractured bones

[Psiklone]
Stand alone, lost in the catacombs
And hammer-throw enemy tanks across war-torn battlezones

[Possessed]
Drain immortal life force from Dracula’s veins
Strapped in a straitjacket underwater, cracking a safe

[Psiklone]
In deep sleeps meat-racking my brain
My unconnected punch shatters Wolverine’s adamantium frame

[Possessed]
And my body’s not a temple, it’s a haunted house
Read my Apocalypse and hear this straight from the Horseman’s mouth

[Psiklone]
No strings attached like a cordless mouse
Make you eat your words then kick you in the stomach just to force them out

[Possessed]
Accelerate time, so when in my presence
Ten years of your life is compressed to within a tenth of a second

[Psiklone]
Only book flights for September 11th
And rip the cancer from Constantine just to prevent him entering Heaven

[Plazma]
Unable to break the habit, I’ve been taking acid
Chasing dragons, inhaling gases through my nasal passage
A brigade of savage trained assassins
As fast as shooting stars moving past surveillance cameras

[Possessed]
We’re the things that go bump in the night
Sleep’s the cousin of death and there’s bodybags under my eyes
The second coming of Christ…
Tears freeze to make the chip on my cold shoulder double in size

[Skirmish]
Extract bullets from inside my head, before my final breath
‘Cause it’s a brain matter of life and death
Danger signs, accumulated hate inside
When I get hotheaded my bodily fluids vaporize

[Psiklone]
Transform bibles to the Book of Shadows
Hang to death then detach my neck from the hooks at gallows
This tape deck’s straight set for active self destruction
It’s Psiklone, Rhyme Asylum, and Padded Cell Productions

[Plazma]
My only passion in life, to hold you captive at night
Hack in your mind, implant an explosive tracking device

[Skirmish]
On detonation, it fractures your spine
Turn the solar system to a Newton's cradle when the planets align

[Plazma]
We move with highly trained armed troopers with live grenades
And precisely aim sharpshooters in firing range

[Skirmish]
Annihilate fighter planes at lightning pace
Suicidal traits, buried myself alive inside a grave

[Plazma]
Razor-sharp Stanley blades in my wrist
Got carried away slashing my veins and amputated my limbs

[Skirmish]
I’ll punch the Hoover Dam with titanium fists
And stand in a tidal wave to wash away all my sins

[Plazma]
A ravenous beast, gather my team of assassins and thieves
And commence a battle between man and machine

[Skirmish]
I use the Third Rail as a balancing beam
I’m high-jumping power lines with hammers strapped to my feet
