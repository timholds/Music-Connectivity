The sound of the falling snow
A squirrel and I are both
At a loss...
For words
Staring until we suddenly burst

And somewhere a still pond bursts
The sign of a brand new world
Being born
Head first
Splashing until it suddenly bursts
To life
Like rain
We watch as our faces change
Crumbling into something more
Beautiful
But strange
It's all about holding on and then letting go
It's all about holding on on on on on on on
And then letting go

It's all about holding on and then letting go...
