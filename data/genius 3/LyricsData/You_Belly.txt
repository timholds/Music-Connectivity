[Chorus: Kehlani]
I'll be up so late just gettin' faded over you
I know you've been patient, I'ma save it just for you
I'll be contemplatin' what I wanna say to you
You, you

[Verse 1: Belly]
I said show me somethin' cause these hoes be frontin'
But they got nothin' on you
Pussy so good, make me turn around
Yeah you know that I bust it up, you
She go to college way down in Miami
And she always reppin' that U
And I fuck with less than a few
I really can't settle for less than a few
What you wanna do?
Shit I'll prolly come to you, when it come to you
I learned this game to a tee all because of you
Now I'm buyin' V, celebratin' all these Ws
Been in the zone for the cameras
First time I met her, shit we was gone in Atlanta
Almost died but it made us feel alive with each other
So we by the lights cause we be high on each other

[Refrain: Belly]
And it's all about you
All about you
All about, all about you
All about you
All about you
All about, all about you
All about you
You

[Chorus: Kehlani]
I'll be up so late just gettin' faded over you
I know you've been patient, I'ma save it just for you
I'll be contemplatin' what I wanna say to you
You, you

[Refrain: Belly]
All about you
All about, all about you
All about you
All about you

[Verse 2: Kehlani]
I've been rollin', I've been really sippin' cause of you
I've been trippin', I've been hittin'
Missin' cause of you
And I don't know why I'm so goddamn persistent
Over you
I done fucked around and caught feelings
Now I'm tryna come up with reasons
For why I'm feining for you
It might not mean nothin' to you
Havin' it to fuckin' on you
Gotta give it up to you
I might keep it a hundred with you
Cause I

[Chorus: Kehlani]
I'll be up so late just gettin' faded over you
I know you've been patient, I'ma save it just for you
I'll be contemplatin' what I wanna say to you
You, you

[Refrain: Belly]
All about you
All about, all about you
All about you
All about you
All about, all about you
All about you
All about you
All about, all about you
All about you
All about you
All about, all about you
All about you

[Bridge: Kehlani]
You
I've been rollin', I've been really sippin' cause of you
I've been rollin', I've been really sippin' cause of you
I've been rollin', I've been really sippin' cause of you
Cause of you
