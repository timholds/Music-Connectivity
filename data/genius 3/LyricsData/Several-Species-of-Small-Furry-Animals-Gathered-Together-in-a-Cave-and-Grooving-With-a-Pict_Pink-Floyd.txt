Aye an’ a bit of Mackeral settler rack and ruin ran it doon by the haim, ‘ma place well I slapped me and I slapped it doon in the side and I cried, cried, cried

The fear a fallen down taken never back the raize and then Craig Marion fet out wi’ ye Claymore out mi pocket a’ ran doon, doon the middin stain picking the fiery horde that was fallen around ma feet

Never he cried, never shall it get me alive
Ye rotten hound of the burnie crew. Well I snatched fer the blade O my claymore cut and thrust and I fell doon before him round his feet
Aye!

(That was pretty avant-garde, wasn't it?)

A roar he cried frae the bottom of his heart that I would nay fall but as dead, dead as ‘a can be by his feet; de ya ken?

…and the wind cried Mary

Thank you
