[Verse 1]
Hey, young buck
In your muddy tire'd pick-up
Dust on the dash, dust on your boots
Keep takin' them curves like Bo and Luke

[Verse 2]
Hey young buck
With your Jack in your sonic cup
She thinks it's strong so you cut it with Sprite
Next think you know it's all goin' right
It's all night kinda night
(That's right)

[Chorus]
Keep chasin' them girls, shootin' at the moon
Raisin' that hell, lovin' Jesus too
You're the heartbeat
Of this little bitty town
You're a bottle rocket lit, Friday night lights
Just like ya daddy and his daddy that's right
Got a fire
You can't put out

[Verse 3]
Hey, young buck
Don't be ashamed of what yer' proud of
Dirt on your hands, dirt on your soul
Dirt on your truck, dirt on your road
That's how you roll
(As long as you roll somewhere)

[Chorus]
Keep chasin' them girls, shootin' at the moon
Raisin' that hell, lovin' Jesus too
You're the heartbeat
Of this little bitty town
You're a bottle rocket lit, Friday night lights
Just like ya daddy and his daddy that's right
Got a fire
You can't put out

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Hey young buck
Just wishin' you a little luck
Head over seas, defend that flag
While your momma keeps prayin', you come back
(Oh, I hope you do)
I'd buy a round or two

[Chorus]
Keep chasin' them girls, shootin' at the moon
Raisin' that hell, lovin' Jesus too
You're the heartbeat
Of this little bitty town
You're a bottle rocket lit, Friday night lights
Just like ya daddy and his daddy that's right
Got a fire
You can't put out

[Outro]
Hey, young buck
(Keep doin' what you're doin'
And doin' it right)
