[Intro:]
We were promised many things and we never received them
We were told many things and we never believed them
Will we honor who we lost or are we only gonna grieve them
Because if we only remember, then we’re only gonna leave them

[Verse One:]
President Obama, I’m standing for change the way that you do
Vocalizing thoughts into a file to put on Youtube
Not trying to be famous, just hoping for views
A second of attention is a choice
But will they choose to even honor me?
How can I deserve to be an honoree
When nominees are chosen like a bingo, or a lottery
I’m a dot within a circle and these boundaries are blocking me
From viewing great things from the “outer see”
I’m ready to break free, mistake free, nothing around me can break me
The simplest of dreams, right? That’s what it seems like
So, tell me why I need a wallet for a green light?
I’m at the table where the scholars sit
Talking ‘bout the similar pains between a pay check and a scholarship
You say I need a degree to be in the lead
But it’s followed by a plead for these monetary needs

[Bridge:]
And it seems that nothing’s ever the same
I can’t ever be proud if I’m a product of my name
And when I say the word name I mean label
Let’s not get confused
I never asked to be mistreated or misused

[Hook:]
I’m asking for a moment of time, I need a moment (x4)

[Verse Two:]
There are times when I hate being a black student
I’m in a desk with negativity attached to it
Seat of a dropout, leading to a cell
(Saying) no bail for jail, behind bars, sit and fail
I can say all that I want, but I’m a one word specific:
Juvenile… Misfit… Ignorant… Statistic…
I simply wish you’d understand
That just because I rhyme and sell record doesn’t mean I have a record…
You say, good music people recognize it
So why are y’all surprised that my lyrics specialize in what I stand for
I’m pointing at the minute hand for time
And realized that there’s none that I can find
They burn me to ashes, black sheets
Only ‘cause I ain’t in sync with these backstreets
Help me out and keep me steady with the present
‘Cause I feel I’ve been divided into segments

[2nd Hook:]
May I have a moment of time? I need a moment
(I see the open signs, please, don’t turn and close it)
May I have a moment of time? I need a moment
(Help should be an ally, not another opponent)
(x2)

[Bridge:]
And it seems that nothing’s ever the same
I can’t ever be proud if I’m a product of my name
And when I say the word name I mean label
Let’s not get confused
I never asked to be mistreated or misused

[Hook:]
I’m asking for a moment of time, I need a moment (x4)

[2nd Hook:]
May I have a moment of time? I need a moment
(I see the open signs, please, don’t turn and close it)
May I have a moment of time? I need a moment
(Help should be an ally, not another opponent)
