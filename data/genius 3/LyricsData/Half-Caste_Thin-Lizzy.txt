I got a girl in Briggston town
Her daddy don't like me hangin' 'round
The boy ain't black, the boy is brown
Don't he know it's a halfcaste town

Big slow
Big slow
Big slow
Big slow

The boy is halfcaste
Halfcaste
Halfcaste

I got a girl up near Richmond way
Her daddy don't like me to lead the girl astray
The brown boy is born to serve he say
Don't he know it's a different day

In the big slow
No joke
Big slow
I like it
Big slow
Big slow

Mister, I'm halfcaste
You see, I'm halfcaste
I got no class
You see, I'm halfcaste
Halfcaste
