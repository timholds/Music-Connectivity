[Chorus]
Fuck wind
Fuck wind
Fuck wind
Fuck wind
Motherfuck wind
Fuck wind
Fuck wind
Fuck that shit

[Verse 1: Hal Williams]
That shit is too cold, when it blows
Can't even move my hands froze, it's way too fucking cold
Can't even call my boo, can't reach the fucking phone
Cause my hand's froze

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Hal Williams]
It's too cold, It's too cold
When it blows, it's too cold
Don't even wanna go outside
Cause it's too fucking cold
It's too cold, can't do shit
Hand's froze
Nigga Fuck Wind!

[Outro]
Ay, ay nigga fuck rain too nigga (Fuck Wind!)
Fuck snow too nigga, fuck all that shit nigga (Fuck Wind!)
Fu-fuck the sun, nigga, man that sh-shit too hot (Fuck Wind!)
Man, nigga, just play that trumpet solo (Trumpet Solo Nigga)
