[Chorus]
You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
Cause you got what I need
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

[Verse 1]
Every time I try to run something keeps stopping me
(Oh, keeps stopping me)
I try my best to turn around
But your touch won't let me leave
(Uh uh, yeah yeah)
I can't control it
You put something inside of me, ooh
Cause you're a problem
Boy, you must have poisoned me, oh

[Chorus]
You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
Cause you got what I need
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

[Verse 2]
Boy, I must be buggin'
Let you play those games I don't understand
(Oh, I can't understand)
I'll be the yoyo on a string
Goin' down, I come right back to your hands
(Uh uh, that's right, uh)
I make excuses, but we keep on rockin' anyway, ooh
But it ain't working'
When I let you go, you make me stay

[Chorus]
You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
Cause you got what I need
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

[Bridge]
Don't let me (me) leave (leave)
Control (control) of me (of me)
You got what (you got what) I need (I need, yeah)
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
Won't let you go, can't let you leave
I need your love inside of me
You got control, control of me
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

[Chorus]
You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
Cause you got what I need
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
Cause you got what I need
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it
