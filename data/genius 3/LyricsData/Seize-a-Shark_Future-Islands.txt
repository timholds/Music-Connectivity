I go to bite your hair
Who would outweigh
You turned your head so fast you broke my neck
T-t-t-turned, turned me to the nightlife
Look away and the day is cold
Sea my eyes fall out of my head
So fast they roll away
T-t-t-turned me, turned me fucking inside

Another saturday with you
Another saturday--i'm missing you all night
I'm missing in my life
Another saturday with you
Mistaking pain for the feeling i'm missing
You all night, another autumn day
Fishing in your life

Ooh you fucking turned me
Ooh you fucking turned me

I go to bite your hair
Who would outweigh
You turned your head so fast you broke my neck
T-t-t-turned me, turned me fucking inside
Another saturday with you
Another saturday--i'm missing you all night
I'm missing in my life
Another saturday with you
Mistaking pain for the feeling i'm missing
You all night, another autumn day
Fishing in your life

You fucking turned me, ooh you fucking turned me in my life
You fucking turned me, another autumn day
Fishing in your life
