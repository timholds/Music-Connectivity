It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy, if I did
I'd buy a bigger house where we both could live

Oh, if I was a sculptor but then again, no
Or a woman who makes potions in a traveling show
I know, it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you, yeah

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It might be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world, oh yeah, yeah

I sat on the roof and I kicked off the moss
Ooh, ooh, a few of the verses well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see, I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway, the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes, Ms. Patti's ever seen

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
Said, I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind, I put it down in words
How wonderful life is Elton, while you're in the world

I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put it down in words
How wonderful life is, Patti, oh while you're in the world
You're in my world, oh yes, I'm taking you back
I'm taking you back, yeah

Patti, yes, life is so wonderful when you're in the world
Oh, Patti, this is your song, oh, baby, this is your song
This is your song, this is your song
This is your song, this is your song

You can tell, you can tell, you can tell, you can tell that
You can tell, you can tell, you can tell, you can tell that
You can tell, you can tell, you can tell, you can tell that
