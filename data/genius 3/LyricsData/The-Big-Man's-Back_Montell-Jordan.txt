The big man's back
Chorus
The big man's back in town
To all you haters and all clowns
All my women lets get down cause the
Big man's back in town (repeat 2X)

Verse I
The big man's back
Beats is so sick
You waiting and debating
Getting impatient
While singers so wood and
Singers go plastic
You put me on the shelf
And I still make classic
(ohhh)
Nah, the tell don't stop
Tight leash on your girl
Cause she's eyeing my drop
R&B scrub (what!) but I am still standing
Praying for you cats having "rocky-landings"

(Repeat chorus)
