[VErse 1]
She's gotta do what she's gotta do
And I've gotta like it or not
She's got dreams too big for this town
And she needs to give 'em a shot
Whatever they are

[Verse 2]
Looks like she's all ready to leave
Nothing left to pack
There ain't no room for me in that car
Even if she asked me to tag along
God I gotta be strong

[Chorus]
She's at the starting line of the rest of her life
As ready as she's ever been
Got the hunger and the stars in her eyes
The prize is hers to win
She's waiting on my blessings before she hits that
Open road
Baby get ready
Get set
Don't go

[Verse 3]
She says things are fallen into place
Feels like they're fallen apart
I painted this big old smile on my face
To hide my broken heart
If only she knew
This is where I don't say what I want so bad to say
This is where I want to but I won't get in the way
Of her and her dreams
And spreading her wings

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Don't go
Don't go
She's gotta do what she's gotta do
She's gotta do what she's gotta do
