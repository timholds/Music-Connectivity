[Verse 1]
Her love rains down on me easy as the breeze
I listen to her breathing, it sounds like the waves on the sea
I was thinking all about her, burning with rage and desire
We were spinning into darkness; the earth was on fire

[Refrain 1]
She could take it back, she might take it back someday

[Verse 2]
So I spied on her, I lied to her, I made promises I cannot keep
Then I hear her laughter rising, rising from the deep
And I make her prove her love for me, I take all that I can take
And I push her to the limit to see if she will break

[Refrain 2]
She might take it back, she could take it back some day

[Instrumental Bridge]
Ring a ring o’ roses
A pocket full of posies
Atishoo, atishoo
We all fall down

[Verse 3]
Now I have seen the warnings, screaming from all sides
It’s easy to ignore them, God knows I’ve tried
All of this temptation, you know it turned my faith to lies
Until I couldn’t see the danger or hear the rising tide

[Refrain 3]
She can take it back, she will take it back some day
She can take it back, she will take it back some day
She will take it back, she will take it back some day
