You know I always get what I want
Because it's just how I do
You know I always get what I want
And baby I want you

You know I always get what I want
Because it's just how I do
You know I always get what I want
And baby I want you

Whether her her honor or force (?)
Or simply on a bed of roses
Anyway that I like it
You know I always get what I want

You know I always get what I want
Because I'm just so damn right all the time
Oh you're so wrong, but
I gut it's just cuz

I'm the law (I'm the law)
I'm the law (I'm the law)
I'm the law (I'm the law)
I'm the law (I'm the law)

I'm the law
I'm the law all the time
You know I always get what I want
I'm the law

You know I always get what I want
Because it's just how I do
You know I always get what I want
And baby I want you

I'm so wright--you're so wrong
I'm so wright--you're so wrong
I'm so wright--you're so wrong
I'm so wright
I'm so wright all the time
You know I always get what I want
I'm the law
