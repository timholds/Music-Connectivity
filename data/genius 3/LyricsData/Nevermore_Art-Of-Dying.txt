Burning all the memories
And watch 'em fade away
Fade away, fade away
Now that you're the enemy
There's nothing left to say
Left to say, left to say

I used to be
Addicted to the pain

Now that I know
I can let go
And leave it all behind
I'm taking control
Out on my own
I can finally feel alive
I don't need you
Anymore
Nevermore
I don't need you
Anymore
Nevermore

A tiny little part of me
Still feels out of place
Out of place, out of place
Nothing you could say to me
Would ever make me stay
Make me stay, make me stay

Oh
I used to be
Addicted to the pain

Now that I know
I can let go
And leave it all behind
I'm taking control
Out on my own
I can finally feel alive
I don't need you
Anymore
Nevermore
I don't need you
Anymore
Nevermore

If I gave you everything
What would be left of
Me?

Now that I know
I can let go
And leave it all behind
I'm taking control
Out on my own
I can finally feel alive
I don't need you
Anymore
Nevermore
I don't need you
Anymore
Nevermore

Nevermore

Nevermore
