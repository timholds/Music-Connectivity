[Verse 1]
Sometimes I think about how lucky I am
To live where I do, to be what I can
And to know that you're mine when I'm holding you close
And to never forget
What matters the most
I'm gonna run with the wind behind me
Have fun when the sun is shining
Stop when the world reminds me
Got to take the time to pray

[Chorus]
Fight for the right to be free
Smile at what my children might be
Live with you beside me
Oh, till my dying day

[Verse 2]
As long as we are here
You know I'll always be there
If we're down to nothing we've still
Sill got so much to share
I know I've been giving way more than I deserve
I'm gonna live every day like it was my last
Baby, I'll always put you first

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm going to walk on the road less traveled
Yeah, sit tall in the saddle
Know when I pick my battles
Not to be afraid
Fight for the right to be free
Smile at what my children might be
And live with you beside me
Until my dying day

[Chorus]
