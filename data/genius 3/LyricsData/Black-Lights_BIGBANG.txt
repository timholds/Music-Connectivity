Lost in language of unspoken souls
Slight of hand behind our frozen walls
All is well in the emotional sprawl
All gets sucked into the Oslo Bowl
It was a windy night after a sunny day
The night 400 years of winter came
The river flows with bad dream ink
And the snow capped woods around us sink
Black lights screaming out across the bay
White teeth dancing just to get away
Lost in language of unspoken souls
Slight of hand behind our frozen walls
All is well in the emotional sprawl
All gets sucked into the Oslo Bowl
