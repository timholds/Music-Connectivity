[Intro]
Hey, I'm live from the underground railroad
Won't fall in the same trap that these niggas fell for
Industry cats ball, but really they barely paid
Rather be broke and keep it real than be a slave
See, they got you live from the underground railroad
Won't fall in the same trap that these niggas fell for
Industry cats ball, but really they barely paid
Rather be broke and keep it real than be a slave

[Big KRIT]
See, they got you caught up in this maze of money cars and bitches
Chains you never wear, clothes that barely fit you
Niggas is down with ya cause you got you some bread
You think Shawdy feel for you cause she gave you some head?
Now, she a best seller because she wrote about your secrets
How you ate her out and you claim you never eat it
Brung her breakfast in bed, claim you never feed her
Nothin' but bubblegum and dick, ain't that a bitch?
Now, your record ain't sellin', bill folk callin'
Really ain't free, you be damned if you walk in
So you drugged, sellin' again
Same game that took you out the hood put you right back in
But you floss and you stunt where the cameras at
Later on handin' all of that jewelry back
Frontin', cause you scared without that you ain't nothin'
But a human being strivin' for somethin'
Superheros don't exist, only on comic strips
Mind, brain, time fly, wonderin' where it went
Now you 808 heartbroken, going crazy
Confused about your life cause you ain't felt the same lately
As you did when you did it for the love
Recordin' in the closet, play it back for your cuz
Writtin' about the truth and the way that it is
To be a nigga from the minors on your way to the bigs
Tellin' all your family that you got 'em and they good
And when this advance hit your bank, you gonna get them out the hood
Buyin' fancy cars on the chrome with the candy
Red carpet treatment, take 'em all to the Grammys
Man, at least that's what the A&R said at the table
With the checks and the label execs
You always did your best and your family understand
The first few years you can't do half the shit that you planned
Damn, you never, ever home, the city think you wrong
Cause your family fucked up and you ridin' on chrome
Cribs got your house on blast, secret compartment
Your brother can't barely afford his one bedroom apartment
On the gutter side of town, niggas can barely eat
But still keep it real and go and purchase your CD
Upset because you ain't did you a mil in a week
Mad at your street team, cause they ain't deeper in the streets
Like all your hard-work paid off
You own your own company, never get laid off
Go party with the rich folk, they feel your pain
Just as lonely as you, wished they had never changed
The game we in
Hey, this the game we in

[Outro]
Now all the rappers came, from far and wide
Talkin' bout money cars and hoes, like that's all to life
Now, I'm here to tell ya, there's a better way
Keep it 1hunna with yourself in this game we play
Like everyday, everyday
Like everyday, everyday
