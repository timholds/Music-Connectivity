I'm not a one girl's guy... [real talk for ya, peep game]
And they know it, when it comes to love I don't lie [we don't lie man]
And the girls respect me for it [you gotta respect that]
Ain't gonna say my nose can't be open [I may never say never]
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there
To choose one from [too many ladies, ha]
I'm tryin' girls out, just tryin' girls out

[Hook]
I love girls, girls, girls
Girls, girls I do adore
Yo put your number on this paper cuz
I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
Whoo! Who you lovin, who you wanna be huggin, heh
Who you wit, who you wanna be fuckin
Got this smarty art chick to whom I pose this question
I read a couple books to add to her soul's progression
To put this in layman's terms, I gave her some knowledge
She gave me, brains in return, she had to drop out of college
Knowin she does this homework, I give her in house tutoring
In and out I'm movin through her student body union and
She, call me professor, say daddy come and test her
So she could fail on purpose and repeat the semester
I'm like, at this rate ma you never graduate
She said, I ain't no fool I make it up in summer school

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Now let the people sing
I'm tryin girls out, [just tryin girls out] just tryin girls out
Yo put your number on this paper cuz I would love to date ya
Holla at ya when I come off tour

[Verse 2: Kanye West]
Now even though I went to college and dropped out of school quick
I always had a P.H.D.--A pretty huge dick
Ladies tired of getting ripped off by guys like this
And giving head is like a whale that's using a toothpick
Well--I'm in the club for a limited time only
2 way or phone me if you tryna bone me
Yo man got moe-nee, you still feel lonely
Claim he love you, it's no doubt, it's Gwen Stef-phony
You a light skinded Nia, a dark skinned Aaliyah
A Black Jennifer Lopez, a ghetto senorita
You remind me of my Jeep, but not no Kia
We can talk on my cell, but not Nokia
It be going in and out thats why I barely hear ya
I be goin' in and out just like a robberia
Iâ€™m tryna take this money like Rob and G-dep
Then i'mma take you to my house like Trick and Trina
Chi-Town, Chi-Town, big city of dreams
And my dick so big it can't fit in my jeans
And a bitch so mad she can't get in my cream
And it get so bad she wanna tear up my things
But still, K-A-N-Y-E
Chi-Town playa out in N-Y-C
She say she wanna go on a shopping spree
Bought her some cheap J.Lo jeans 'cuz the ass was free

[Outro]
I'm not a one girl's guy, and they know it
When it comes to love, I don't lie, and the girls respect me for it
Ain't gonna say my nose? can't be over
But right now it's just too many fine ladies out there to choose one from
I'm tryin girls out, waiting patiently
Just tryin girls out, until I find the one for me
