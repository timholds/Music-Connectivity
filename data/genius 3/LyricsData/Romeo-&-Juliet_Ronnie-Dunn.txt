[Verse 1]
Rolling down a back road Dead dark night
In a bald tire beater with a loose head light
Kinda going nowhere getting there fast
Out of cigarettes Low on gas
I should a took it Should a shut my mouth
Spent a night or two of sleeping on the couch
Can’t just walk away Let it go South
There has to be a way to work this out

[Chorus]
Can we start all over again
Just go back to being friends
We can’t give up on us yet
We’re Romeo and Juliet

[Verse 2]
This ain't nothing that we can’t work through
Mis-understanding I’m so in love with you
I can’t stand it Feeling this alone
I know you hear it ringing Baby pick up the phone
It’s gonna happen every now and then
Can’t just come apart and let it end
Can’t give it up Throw us away
Baby there’s a will there’s got to be a way

[Chorus][x2]
