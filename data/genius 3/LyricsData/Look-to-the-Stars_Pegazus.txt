Long ago in a land so far away
A tale is told
Of a ancient man wiser than an owl
Whose name they did not know
Lost in a time where the meaning you'll find is a lie
Tales of old from a long time ago set in stone

Look to the stars with hope and trust
Let your mind roam free
The legends lives in the hearts of those
Who see beyond the lies

Mystery shrouds, the secrets of the old man
Who people came to see
For the answers to the questions
And the knowing of the future
And predictions of forthcoming tragedies
Lost in a time where the meaning you'll find is a lie
Tales of old from a long time ago set in stone

Look to the stars with hope and trust
Let your mind roam free
The legends lives in the hearts of those
Who see beyond the lies

Nostradamus wrote the book of prophecies
In which history will be told
As time ticks away and the days fall behind
Each vision will unfold
Lost in a time where the meaning you'll find is a lie
Tales of old from a long time ago set in stone

Look to the stars with hope and trust
Let your mind roam free
The legends lives in the hearts of those
Who see beyond the lies
Look to the stars and tell me what you see
Let your mind unfold
The constellations are in perfect harmony
Look to the stars
