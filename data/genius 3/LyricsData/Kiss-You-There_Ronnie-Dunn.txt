[Verse 1]
Sweating on a tractor in Oklahoma
Sunset in the canyon in Arizona
Midnight at the top of the empire state
In the middle of the traffic on the Golden Gate
Standing in front of the Mona Lisa
Chilling in Cabo with a margarita
On the roof of Buckingham Palace
On the fifty-yard line in Dallas
Ohhhhh Ohhhhh

[Chorus]
I wanna kiss, I wanna kiss you, I want to kiss you there
You never know when, Iâ€™ll lay one on your lips
It could be anywhere
I wanna kiss you there
Ohhhhh Ohhhhh

[Verse 2]
Top of the wheel at the fair in Ohio
Rolling in Vegas at the Grand Casino
Taking a walk on the wall in China
Lying on the beach down in Carolina
Throwing beads in the old French Quarter
Tijuana cafe on the Mexico border
In Atlanta, cruising on Peach Tree
Rocking lower Broad in the Music City
Ohhhhh Ohhhhh

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Someday, when you say yes, in a white dress
Baby, looking like a princess
Nobody and their brother going to stop me
In front of God and everybody

[Chorus]
