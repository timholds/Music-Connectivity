[Verse]
You picked me up, you shot me down
You're stepping out all over town
Drove me back to drinking in this bar
I found myself a brand new friend
I'm headed that road again
Working on my next broken heart
Happy or sad, it's hard to tell
You taught me how to hurt so well
But when it comes to love I know my part
I'll play this game that I can't win
I'll be somebody's fool again
Working on my next broken heart

[Chorus][x2]
I thought all along you would
Be the death of me
I met one tonight who wants
What's left of me
I've seen that look before
She'll tear my world apart
I'm working on my next
Broken heart

[Outro]
I'm working on my next
Broken heart[x2]
