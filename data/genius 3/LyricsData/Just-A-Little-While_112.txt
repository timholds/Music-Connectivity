(Slim)
I have to go away
My flight's not far away
You think your love has strength
But it's just your mind, oh yeah
My heart is in your hand
Waiting for your command
That's enough assurance to believe I'm true
So baby hold on

1 - Just a little while
Just a little while longer
Just a little while
I'm coming back to you
In a little while
For a little while longer
In a little while
I'm coming back

(Daron)
A thousand wasted tears
Our love's been strong for years
Your cry is not in vain
'cause I understand
I'm trying to be the man
You loved when we began
Your cry is not alone
I'm crying too
You gotta hold on

Repeat 1

(Slim)
If only you knew my love
You wouldm't feel this way
Baby don't be afraid
'cause I'm coming back to you

(Daron)
Do you hear my plea
For understanding
Wait for me
In my arms you're gonna be
In just

Repeat 1 until fade
