Johnny Cool was the king
The leader of the boot boys
He'd never cause no trouble
In a rumble make some noise

He heard about some chick
And the way she liked to rock
He said, "Come here, honey
Let me see you lift up your frock"

There's gonna be a little showdown, showdown, yeah
There's gonna be a little showdown, showdown, yeah

Miss Lucy was a chick
He knew she like to ball
He said, "Come on, Lucy
It don't matter to me at all"

But Miss Lucy got a fellow
With a flick knife in his hand
Johnny Cool pull a shotgun
The man is in command

There's gonna be a little showdown, showdown, yeah
There's gonna be a little showdown, showdown, yeah

There's gonna be a little showdown, showdown, yeah
There's gonna be a little showdown, showdown, yeah

King Cool
King Kong
King King
With all the kings

King of hearts he's a lover and he give her everything
King of spades he's a brother doing his own thing
King of clubs makes a dollar
King of diamonds is a wedding ring

There's gonna be a little showdown, showdown, yeah
There's gonna be a little showdown, showdown, yeah

There's gonna be a little showdown, showdown, yeah
Showdown, showdown, yeah
