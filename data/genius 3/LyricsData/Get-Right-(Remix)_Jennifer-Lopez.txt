[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I am not Mr. Right, I am Mr. Right Now
I keep women in thongs coming along
Invisibly set stones, some of them prone
I can tell you that you never had someone this long
One night, have them bumping my song like mmm, mmm girl
You don't know I was coming this strong
Now you know not to come at me wrong
I get right

[Jennifer Lopez]
You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me
Tripping a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right tonight
(We can get right)

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Your lips talking 'bout I "play too much"
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips moving oh so slow
Bar tab, looking like a car note
All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right tonight
(We can get right)

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
So much we have got to say, but so little time
And if tonight isn't long enough, don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand, I will show you why

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right tonight
(We can get right)

[Verse 4: Fabolous]
It is slim with the tilted rim on 20 inch rims
Rock up wrist watch, 6 inch Timbs
Button-up shirt cuffed with the French trim
So you can tell a man get to the right
I'm in the driver's seat, you sit to the right
And this is just to get to the flight
I like the way it fit to you tight
So I'm going to show you the world in a day for you
Even get to the night
I am looking for a dime, but I don't need a penny though
Any old wanna be Jenny-Lo, no!
Plenty dough and there is plenty more where it come from
I am the real talk where I come from

[Chorus] (2x)
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right tonight
(We can get right)
