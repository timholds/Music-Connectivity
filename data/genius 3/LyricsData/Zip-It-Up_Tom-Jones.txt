I, I who have nothing, I, I who have no one
Adore you and want you so
I'm just a no one with nothing to give you
But, oh, I love you

He, he buys you diamonds
Bright, sparkling diamonds
But believe me, dear, when I say
That he can give you the world
But he'll never love you the way I love you

He can take you anyplace he wants
To fancy clubs and restaurants
But I can only watch you with
My nose pressed up against the window pane

I, I who have nothing, I, I who have no one
Must watch you go dancing by
Wrapped in the arms of somebody else
When darling it's I who loves you

I love you
I love you
I love you
