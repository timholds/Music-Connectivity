One step at a time
I'll leave in just a minute
Just a minute
A minute and I'll be on my way
One step at a time
One step at a time
I'll leave in just a minute
I'll tear the whole thing down
Move to another town
And find someone else
One step at a time
From inside the stones
We sound like most pathetic things
Chasing crowns and rings
When we could be living
One step at a time
One step at a time
We battle out another round
We almost lose our minds
Just to feel something
One step at a time
One step at a time
Like the stuff we love
Great and almost done
Until the sun comes up
Or the real thing comes along
