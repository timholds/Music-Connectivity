I was all up in these streets you could say I get around, oh
I was only thinking about me but I think that I may have found
Found something that could make me change my mind
Something that could make me stop wasting time
Something I know I can live for, I don't wanna do this no more

I'm tired of doing me, cause it ain't working, no
I'm always doing me, I was just searching but it ain't working
But doing you is so much better, I was doing me couldn't find nothing better
I'm tired doing me, I'm tired doing me, cause it ain't working, no, no

I wouldn't give my heart to nobody, afraid from the past
But I'm done with playing games, done with doing me
Done with the same old same, I'm giving my all
This time I won't let you pass me by
So baby, if you feel the same that I do, and ashamed to let you know

It's harder doing me, cause it ain't working, no
When I was doing me, I was just searching but it ain't working
Cause doing you is so much better, I was doing me couldn't find nothing better

Tired doing me, cause it ain't working, no, no

You're everything (you're everything)
I'll ever need (I'll ever need)
I won't ever let you get away from me, no
Boy I've done everything, all that I can do
I've seen the best in life, know what I'm a gonna do
I feel like I'm ready, I feel like a change, I feel like we both have the same world
I know, doing me ain't working no more, no more

I'm starting to believe, cause it ain't working, no
When I was doing me, I was just searching but it ain't working
Cause doing you is so much better, I was doing me couldn't find nothing better
I'm tired doing me, cause it ain't working, no, no

(I'm so tired, I ain't doing me no more, no more)
