[Hook:]
No more waiting for diamonds to fall
And no more wasting the time that we hold
'Cause all I know is tomorrow could be gone
Tomorrow tomorrow could be gone
No more waiting on those days to die

[Verse 1:]
I've been pretty deep in spirals
Dark and struggles
I buried in the largest puddles
Everyone's costar when they're outside
When they're with the loved one far in cuddles
Each human being is a one bring in who learnin
Some might be poor, some might be earning
Some might be gay call that might determine
Who you are despite being a star
I made a few arrangements
God told me I ain't got out in the basement
Gwap gwap it was me my team relevant
When it pops off I'll fly like a pelican
Over the years I've been wrong
But after the 15th steps I've been gone
Straight to the office that called up great songs
I been on the planet
Some of you been on the drive drifting on

[Hook:]
No more waiting for diamonds to fall
And no more wasting the time that we hold
'Cause all I know is tomorrow could be gone
Tomorrow tomorrow could be gone
No more waiting on those days to die

[Verse 2:]
If there ever was a win
Then the win is now
And everybody wins when the king's in town
When they both go in, they turn the city out
No shitting
The flow is so so so different
Listen a man
But whenever we're there we're oh so glisten
And this right here is for written
Now remain in the fact that we are also brilliant
Ye we heard your callin and got me a little swollen
No beginners so we crept in the morning
Hit the booth callin and a pain millionaire
I see my dream, my team wasn't aware
Abuse London scene wasn't prepared
A few jumps and space pulling ye
A season and you respect one of your peers
And if tomorrow never come shit better be care
Stars up you kept going can't believe this

[Hook:]
No more waiting for diamonds to fall
And no more wasting the time that we hold
'Cause all I know is tomorrow could be gone
Tomorrow tomorrow could be gone
No more waiting on those days to die

[Verse 3:]
Describe yourself in one word , grime
What do you value the most, time
What do you see when you lost, signs
How do you feelin right now, fine
But I could never mood swing like anytime
But not the mood swing that resorts in crime
I love this life, so why am I gonna come back
To my old life when I'm alright
In my world it's not about black
It's not about yellow, it's not about white
We're all been in a multicultural hype
Red sky at night, shepherd's delight
Hope tomorrow's a better day for real
It's all fun and games until
I go hungry then I seek the meal
Album alert, then I seek the deal

[Hook:]
No more waiting for diamonds to fall
And no more wasting the time that we hold
'Cause all I know is tomorrow could be gone
Tomorrow tomorrow could be gone
No more waiting on those days to die
