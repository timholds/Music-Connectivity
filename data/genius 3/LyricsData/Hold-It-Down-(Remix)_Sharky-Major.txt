[Intro: Sharky Major]
Hold it down
Hold it down, boy
Hold it down
Hold it down, boy
Hold it down (hold it down, I said hold it down)
Hold it down, boy
Hold it down (hold it down, I said hold it down)
Hold it down, boy (Biggaman)

[Hook: Sharky Major]
Hold it down, I said hold it down
Wicked man this and wicked man that
But man ain't saying nothing
When the wicked man clap
Hold it down, I said hold it down
All this wicked man chat
All the goons in your ends are like
"I don't know that clown"

[Verse 1: Mercston]
Yeah, pull up your jeans, pull up a chair, dan
You're rolling with God or you with Satan
Young boy, I've been the same one for days
Black tracksuit, I'm in the same one
Girls in the ends, friends have been on the same one
Man ah man's A1, Audi
Used to fuck a ting over boundary
You couldn't chuck a ting over county
But let me take it back to the landing
Years before Stam had the hand ting
Sovereign's chilling, the fat chaps, I'm me that
Clap a ting so, so immediate
Most of my friends dem smoked sensimilia
I had 20/20 vision, dem man dere, they would lean up
But when the feds come around, it was knees up
Everybody gone, link back at Lefever

[Hook: Sharky Major]
Hold it down, I said hold it down
Wicked man this and wicked man that
But man ain't saying nothing
When the wicked man clap
Hold it down, I said hold it down
All this wicked man chat
All the goons in your ends are like
"I don't know that clown"

[Verse 2: Hitman Hyper]
I'm a nightmare, donny
See me, fam? I don't fight fair, donny
I'll squeeze off and just light bare donnies
If you want beef, I'm right here, donny
All you hear is a blam
Head get mash like pounded yam
Real blazing like man is in 'Dam
On point with it like an HD cam so
I'm on sight with it
Bulldog 44, get your face bite with it
Get hit to the left and right with it
When I squeeze off, I'll say goodnight with it
If you carry a whip, you're no problem
Man'll run up on anybody with no problem
Tossing your head and your body with no problem
Bang bang on anybody with no problem

[Hook: Sharky Major]
Hold it down, I said hold it down
Wicked man this and wicked man that
But man ain't saying nothing
When the wicked man clap
Hold it down, I said hold it down
All this wicked man chat
All the goons in your ends are like
"I don't know that clown"

[Verse 3: Sharky Major]
Yeah, I'm going on blacker than charcoal
Don't know wah gwan for you arseholes
You're not a badboy cause you watched couple Narcos
I'll ship man out like cargo
Dem boy dere will struggle to move half Os
See it all clear, I scanned 'em, no barcode
And I'm puzzled like
Tell me how you're gonna ever make large dough?
You clowns are ridiculous
I can't help but laugh, don't come try spit with us
Becuase you lack ambition, cuz
I can make two calls, we can put on a car show
Man ah talk road when they aren't road
They ain't on nuttin' but at home in a bathrobe
Waiting on a giro to go cop a half O
No ratings, you get a minus 9 so

[Hook: Sharky Major]
Hold it down, I said hold it down
Wicked man this and wicked man that
But man ain't saying nothing
When the wicked man clap
Hold it down, I said hold it down
All this wicked man chat
All the goons in your ends are like
"I don't know that clown"

[Verse 4: King Rah]
I came with a maje, knows what I does
Came from the trap, wrote it in cunch
Now I'm in the booth, rolling it up
Wanna get high so I'm smoking it up
Don't chat, you're a cunt, dickhead
I used to kill niggas
Come from an ends that's cool to kill niggas
I don't even burst in the air when I shoot
I hold it down, like you should
They hail me like "you god"
I'mma fire like a new boss
Leave a body round New Cross
And I'mma aim for the right side, left side, lean off
Squeeze off, hop in the whip, I'll speed off
Ease off the chat when you think he's off
Next time, don't chat shit, please just

[Outro: Sharky Major]
Hold it down
Hold it down, boy
Hold it down
Hold it down, boy
Hold it down
Hold it down, boy
Hold it down
Hold it down, boy
