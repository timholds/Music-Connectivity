[Intro: Kelly Rowland]
You know, we've been spending a lot of time together and um, I was wondering do you:
(Feel the same way I do)
I can tell you, I know you need me to show you, but, it's better if I hear it from you
You know what, let me explain myself

[Verse 1: Kelly Rowland (Destiny's Child)]
It's 7 am you're still here with me, and last night I held you tightly so
What does that mean, you see I know what it means to me
It means that I, I, wouldn't let you go
Tell me, is your heart still spinning from the night before?
(You are real good yeah)
And you really need to let me know are you here just for, (sexual dealings)
See if you are then, (I), I just can't live a, (lie), cause I'm certain how I feel about you
But if you tell me, (I), am the one and this is, (right), then we can spend the night tonight like always
But first you, gotta tell me

[Hook Kelly Rowland (Destiny's Child)]
That you (Feel the same way I do)
Darling you know, that I won't let you know unless you (Feel the same way I do)
So if you tell me what I gotta do, before I get caught up in you
Do you really (Feel the same way I do)
So tell me, tell me, us can be a good thing
But you gotta (Feel the same way I do) do

[Verse 2: Beyonce (Destiny's Child)]
So now it midnight, haven't heard a reply
But I can see the truth lies in your eyes
Could it be that you tried, but I didn't see the sunset pass me bye, when you were making love to me
Said it three times, (you said) you love me, (after) you held me
But then you never even said goodnight
(Anything I ask of you) you give it, (when you wanted me) I submitted, still no commitment, but if I don't get it then
(I) I just can't live a (lie), cause I'm certain how I feel about you
But if you tell me, (I), I am the one and this is, (right), you can spend the night tonight like always
Long as you first tell me

[Hook: Beyonce (Destiny's Child)]
That you (Feel the same way I do)
Darling you know, that I won't let you know unless you (Feel the same way I do)
So if you tell me what I gotta do, before I get caught up in you
Do you really (Feel the same way I do)
So tell me, tell me, this could be a good thing
But you gotta (Feel the same way I do)

[Bridge: Michelle]
Ooh I see your eyes, and I hear you calling
When you're speaking and I need to hear something
First thing I wanna hear (I've been meaning to tell you something)
The second thing is (If I can't have you I don't want nothing)

[Outro: Kelly Rowland & Male Voice]
Who that knocking at my door this time of night?
Ooh oh, hey baby
What you doing over here so late?
I wanted to tell you something
I just, I don't know how to tell you right
Do you have anything you want to say?
Alright, you know what, I love you

[Hook 2]
Feel the same way I do
Feel the same way I do
Feel the same way I do
