[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected
I don’t wanna worry no more
I’d give anything for you to come and help me perfect it
I don’t wanna worry no more
I don’t wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry
Wanna feel like I’m brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you
Ain’t no other way they had to
I’mma always hold it down for ya
Look at how I move around for ya

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected
I don’t wanna worry no more
Just want you to know my name by the time we exit
Wanna feel like I’m brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you
I don't wanna worry no more

[Verse 2: Rick Ross]
The feeling that you give me is a coke rush
Addicted to fast money, white Lamborghini
My name ring bells, authorities wanna see me
Born king, I swore she was Nefertiti
Never been to Egypt, try to stay up out of debt
IRS is watching, they follow us on my neck
Still onto me but I’m only coming correct
This audio is gems, my niggas wanna collect
We the biggest in the game so let's just give us respect
Dance like a star, ass shake like a car
She really something special, I can tell from afar
Eyes on the check, 8-figures, feelin' best
Hustle on the corner, Givenchy be the finesse
Ex-drug dealer but still got his connects, yes

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected
I don’t wanna worry no more
Just want you to know my name by the time we exit
Wanna feel like I’m brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you
I don't wanna worry no more

[Outro: Jennifer Lopez]
I’mma always hold it down for ya
Move around for ya
I don't wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry
I don't wanna worry no more
Hold it down for ya
I'mma move around for ya
I don't wanna worry no more
Hold it down for ya
Every time I come around for ya
I’mma always hold it down for ya
Look at how I move around for ya
Do anything that you can, to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry
I don't wanna worry no more
How I move around for ya
How I move around for ya
How I move around for ya
How I move around for ya
How I move around for ya
