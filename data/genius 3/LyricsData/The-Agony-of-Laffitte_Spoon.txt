[Verse 1]
All I ever asked of you is a copy of garage days and to tell me the truth
There is no one watching you exit Venture Highway
It's like I knew two of you man
The one before and after we shook hands
Taking the calls but in all forgetting what's been said
And after dark in a cab in L.A. forget about the meter man these are salad days
Comes on the radio comes on and what's being said
Is you're no better than Sylvia

[Chorus]
No better than Sylvia[x3]

[Verse 2]
Where you are and where you've been and where you've gone oh no
Here's a mark he's a mark on the page
Dishing out the wisdom of this reflexive age
Dotting the eyes with an eye for defining what you were
So when you do that line tonight
Remember that it came at a steep price
And keep telling yourself there's more to you than her
But you're no better than Sylvia

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Where you gone where you been and where you gone oh no
