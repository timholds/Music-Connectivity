Hard as nails
Far from green
You're the strongest one
I've ever seen
Your beak burns red
Ever full of fight
I can see it in your eyes
In your bold golden eyes
There isn't much i can give you
Not as much as i would like to
I know you don't ask for much
You coo "i don't have to"
And that my broken/growing heart is all you want from me
To make as good as new
I'm so grateful you look out for me
So I try to do for you
Take flight
Return when you have to
I'll be perched on the branch here
Waiting for you
Take flight
Return when you want to
I'll be here with my open heart
That's the best I can do
