I'm comin' home
I said I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
I said I'm comin' home
I just can't wait to get back home

I'm comin' home
(Back to L.A.)
I said I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
(Ba-back to L.A.)
I said I'm comin' home
I'm comin' home
(Back to L.A.)
I said I'm comin' home
(Ba-back to L.A.)

Damn, it's good to be back home
In city streets where I used to roam
The neighborhood has changed
But somethin' always stays the same
Liquor stores on every other block
I see my homies so I make a stop
And though I'm tempted
I won't fall back in the game

My next stop is filled with love
Because it's moms and pops I'm thinkin' of
As I get closer, I smell the Bar-B-Q
And as I step into the yard
My grandma shouts "I praise the Lord"
And so do the honeys, uh
This'll be so cool
To be back home

Where I belong
I'm back in L.A
Where I used to stay
Where I long to be
This is home for me
Back in L.A

As the party starts to coolin' out
You know me, and here's what I'm thinkin' 'bout
Gettin' with a cutie
'Cause I don't have much time
(My flight leaves at nine)
Should I go with the one that I know well?
Or swing a new one back to my hotel?
It really doesn't matter
'Cause all of them are so fine

Now, um, uh
I think I know what kind of woman you are
So what would you do for a Klondike bar?
Would you swing from a chandelier?
Or maybe whisper "oh Monty" with your tongue in my ear
I tell ya girl, if you're the one that I choose
I'm knockin' boots and pumps
And any other kind of shoes
And you could keep my drawers as memoirs
Of my last day, when Monty Swing was back in L.A

Where I belong
This is home for me
I'm back in L.A., yeah
Where I long to be
Back in L.A
Oh oh, oh oh

As a tear comes to my eye
It's so hard to say goodbye
I would like to stay, but I got other plans
So I tip my cap with ease
I treasure all those precious memories
'Cause I got to get back out to all of my fans

Now it's off to Atlanta GA
And I might stop in D.C. on the way
Chillin' on the east coast
But just a little while
But no matter where I go
I will always let you know
That I'm singing this South Central L.A. style

And I'm back home
Where I belong
I'm back in L.A
Where I used to stay
Where I long to be
This is home for me
Back in L.A
Oh oh, oh oh

I'm chillin' on Crenshaw
On 54th Street
On 4th Avenue
This might be new to you
But I'm goin' on home
This is where I belong
I'm back in L.A
Oh oh, oh oh
