Listen all of you people
Come and take a few lessons from me
Get yourselves prepared for judgement day
Hallelujah lujah
When you hear the trumpet blast
Then you know you're home at last
Open up them pearly gates for me

Why don't you
Open up them pearly gates
Open up them pearly gates
Open up them pearly gates for me?
Hallelujah lujah!
When you hear the trumpet blast
Then you know you're home at last
Open up them pearly gates for me for me

All you gambling sinners
Now's time to start believing
You're gonna meet your maker some sweet day
Hallelujah lujah!
When you hear the trumpet clear
Gonna say goodbye to fear
Open up them pearly gates for me

Why don't you
Open up them pearly gates
Open up them pearly gates
Open up them pearly gates for me?
Hallelujah lujah!
When you hear the trumpet blast
Then you know you're home at last
Open up them pearly gates for me for me
