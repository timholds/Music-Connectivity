[Verse]
I've gone out of my way
Big, blank slate every day
Big blank, canvas staring at me every day
Revenge[x3]
Push pin stuck in
I've got stuck in
The word's out
I'm not sure where I am
How I'm going to get back where I am
What the real purpose is what I want
What I want to reveal
Stuck in Dallas with the Lavallette
Got to blink kids are staring at me like a set
I fucked up, now I just won again


[Outro]
(Revenge, Revenge, Revenge) I'm not sure where I am
(Revenge, Revenge, Revenge) How I'm going to get back where I am
(Revenge, Revenge) What the real purpose is what I want
(Revenge, Revenge) What I want to reveal
