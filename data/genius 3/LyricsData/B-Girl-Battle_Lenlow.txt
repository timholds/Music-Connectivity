[Britney]
Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know

[Black Eyed Peas’ Fergie]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

[Britney (BEP)]
Oh baby, baby (Shut up)
I shouldn’t have let you go (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)

[Black Eyed Peas’ Fergie (Beyonce)]
Shut up, just shut up, shut up
Shut up, just shut up, shut up (Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no)

[Bridge: Beyonce]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)

[Beyonce]
I look and stare so deep in your eyes
I touch on you more and more every time
When you leave I'm begging you not to go
Call your name two or three times in a row
Such a funny thing for me to try to explain
How I'm feeling and my pride is the one to blame
‘Cause I know I don't understand
Just how your love you’re doing no one else can

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now (Shut it up)
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now {your love} (Shut up, shut up)
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now {your touch} (Shut up, shut up)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Shut it up)
Looking so crazy in love's
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love

[Black Eyed Peas’ Fergie]
We try to take it slow, but we're still losing control
And we try to make it work, but it still ends up the worst
And I'm craaazzzy, for trying to be your laaadddy
I think I'm going crazy

[Britney]
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me baby ’cause I need to know now, oh because

[Chorus 2: Britney (BEP)]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess I still believe (I still believe)
When I’m not with you I lose my mind (Shut up…Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Give me a sign (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Hit me baby one more time (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)

[Beyonce]
When I talk to my friends so quietly
"Who he think he is?" look at what you did to me
Tennis shoes, don't even need to buy a new dress
If you ain't there, ain't nobody else to impress
It's the way that you know what I thought I knew
It's the beat that my heart skips when I'm with you
But I still don't understand
Just how the love you're doing no one else can

[BEP]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losing control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm craaazzzy

[Chorus (with variations) - Beyonce]
Got me looking so crazy right now
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (In love)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch) (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Looking so crazy in love's (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)

[BEP]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm craaazzzy
For tryin to be your laaadddy
I think I'm goin crazy

[Chorus 2: Britney]
My loneliness is killing me (And I)
I must confess I still believe (I still believe)
When I’m not with you I lose my mind (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Give me a sign (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Hit me baby one more time (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)

[Chorus: Beyonce (BEP)]
Got me looking so crazy right now (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Your love's got me looking so crazy right now (In love) (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Got me looking so crazy right now (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now (Your touch) (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Got me hoping you'll page me right now (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Your kiss got me hoping you'll save me right now (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Looking so crazy in love's (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
Got me looking, got me looking so crazy in love (Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
