He said that you were crazy
He said that you were losin your mind
And that you don't know how to treat a man
But baby you do me just fine
Everytime he comes around
He tells me how you did him wrong
Telling me you broke his heart
But I don't really give a damn about what he says
'cause check this out

I think (I think) that you're a beautiful woman
And I think (I think) that you deserve a good man
I think (I think) that I could be the man for ya
So baby won't you take my hand
I think (I think) that you're a beautiful woman
And I think that you deserve a good man
I think that I could be the man for ya
So baby (baby) won't you take my hand

He says your disrespectful
And that you don't know how to carry yourself
And now he's tellin me your ghetto
But still I want no one else
I'm really sick and tired of him
And the way that he talks about you
I think I'm gonna tell him (oh yea oh yea) hey I love that woman

I think (I think) that you're a beautiful woman
And I think (I think) that you deserve a good man
I think (I think) that I could be the man for ya
So baby won't you take my hand
I think (I think) that you're a beautiful woman
And I think that you deserve a good man
I think that I could be the man for ya
So baby (baby) won't you take my hand

He's always telling me that you're not the one for me
But I see things in you that he would never see
So no matter what he says and baby no matter what he might do
There is nothing and no one that can change my feelings for you oh baby yea

I think (I think) that you're a beautiful woman
And I think (I think) that you deserve a good man
I think (I think) that I could be the man for ya
So baby won't you take my hand
I think (I think) that you're a beautiful woman
And I think that you deserve a good man
I think that I could be the man for ya
So baby (baby) won't you take my hand
