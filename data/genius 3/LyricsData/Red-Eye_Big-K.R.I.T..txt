[Intro]
I'm trying to find out what's going on with our relationship, why am I the only one that's always calling, making an effort? I understand that you're busy on the road, you have to do what you have to do for your career, but I feel like if you really want this relationship, you do what you have to do for us also. Like I'm always, always the one doing everything, and I'm just tired like... call me back baby

[Verse]
I'm like what happened to us, maybe I'm rapping too much
I been missing your touch, sometimes I'm out and I lust
What if love ain't enough, and all we have is this trust
What if I'm fucking that up, so you don't trust in me much
I'm wasting your time, to say I'm straight, I'd be lying
It's either you or this music but I can't make up my mind
I'd throw you a line, I'd give you a sign
Right now I'm through with the trying, I think you ready to fly
I settle for less so when I'm tired of stress
I go through the motions pretending I'm at my best
Fall victim to flesh, I live to be fresh
But this ain't what I expect because my life is a wreck
I run out of breath cause I ain't taking the steps
Money comes and it goes 'til family's all I got left
I'm seeing my growth, but I'm still from myself
You'll be hollering out next because you're ready to fly
I can't find the words so you'll just fill in the blanks
I'm doing the norm and not what it takes
I'll keep folding my cards and you'll keep raising the stakes
'Til we forget about us and what we have is too late
I know in your heart, you ain't conditioned to race
So I steady the wheel, forever pumping the brakes
Resort to the bottle, that's how I deal with the shakes
Pray for these haters, that's how I deal with the hate
Look to the sky, don't be content with the now
You ain't concerned with the why, you just wanna know how
I didn't give it a chance, when you just wanna be down
And save me from myself, but I'm wanting to drown
King is much more than the weight of a crown
As good as it feels, that ain't the way that it sounds
Being single is cool 'til ain't nobody around
Then I'm chasing you down, cause you was ready to fly
I can't be what you want me to be
You're shooting too high cause you ain't aiming at me
One minute you're calling out for the D
Then the next minute you wanna be free
Then the next minute you hollering out peace
Although I know it's a war and there'll be blood in the street
If you call don't be frustrated at me
Just leave you're heart at the beep, cause mine is harder to reach
Cause mine is harder to see
And that don't make it harder to cheat
Being friends would make it harder to breathe
So if you ready to fly, just forget about me
But if you willing to try then I'm willing to leap
Out of the window of pain and fall in love at your feet
I ain't the man you want me to be
I guess that's what's been bothering me
