[G-Dragon] Letting you go... (can somebody...)
Letting you go... (please somebody...)
No I got this, yeah

Steady thinkin' 'bout this thing called love
It got me shaken up
([Seungri] Please tell me there's a way)
And it got my head just spinnin' round round round round
([Seungri] Please tell me there's a way)
Don't wanna take a fall
It's best that I break it all
It's gonna be better for you to move on
([Seungri] Please tell me there's a way)
And my heart be breakin' breakin'
All apart remakin' makin'
How can I recover it all

[Taeyang] Girl I swear kimi no koto wo ichibyou demo
Kanashimasenai yakusoku
Mamoru tame ni wa mo moukoreshika
Erabu michi wa nai kara

[Daesung] Baby aishiteru dake kizutsuketeshimau
And I've got nothing, nothing to say

Uhuuuh~~
[All] Tell me goodbye, oh, tell me goodbye
[Seungri] Dakishimeta te wo
[All] Tell me goodbye, oh, tell me goodbye
[Daesung] Hanasou
Boku wo wasureru koto ni jiyuu ni naru nara Baby
[All] Tell me goodbye, oh, tell me goodbye

[Seungri] Girl you know kimi ga egao naku shiteku hodo
Boku wa jibun mo semeru yo
Nego semeru kotoba mo hikari sae mo
Nanimokamo miushinau

[Taeyang] Baby kono kuchibiru ga hanareta shunkanni
I'll never find better, better than you

[All] Tell me goodbye, oh, tell me goodbye
[Seungri] Dakishimeta te wo
[All] Tell me goodbye, oh, tell me goodbye
[Daesung] Hanasou
Soba ni iru koto dake ga yasashisa janai to Baby
[All] Tell me goodbye, oh, tell me goodbye

[T.O.P] And it's so, so
Sad it just ain't happenin'
Wish it could be better
Sorry to be scrappin'
But I just can't let ya
Be less than happy
How sad would that be
I couldn't live with myself seein' you lackin'
The things you deserve
Baby you was a part?
Best believe that it hurts
Deeply, that's word
I feel the achin' through my body
It just takes a bigger part of me
To be lettin' you go
I wish it weren't so...

[Daesung] Kimi no koe setsunaku fade away... away-ay-ay-ay
[Seungri] Kaze ni kakikesareteyuku stay... stay-ay-ay-ay

[Taeyang] Kore ijou wa I can't ([G-Dragon] take it), sono namida don't cry ([G-Dragon] for me)
[Daesung] Kimi no tame never look back again-a-a-a-ain... Ohh

[All] Tell me goodbye, oh, tell me goodbye
[Seungri] Dakishimeta te wo ([Daesung] Ohh)
[All] Tell me goodbye, oh, tell me goodbye
[Daesung] Hanasou
Soba ni iru koto dake ga yasashisa janai to Baby
[All] Tell me goodbye, tell me goodbye
[Daesung] Tell me goodbye
