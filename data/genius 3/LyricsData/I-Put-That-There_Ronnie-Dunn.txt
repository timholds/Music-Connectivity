[Verse 1]
That Johnny Cash poster, hangin' on the wall
That black & white one, where he's flippin' you off
And that fist-sized hole it's hidin', in between the studs behind it
I put that there

[Verse 2]
That black mark in the driveway, on the way out to the road
That dashboard Jesus, bobbin' as she goes
And that desperate in the prayer, she's praying, that heart full of lonely kinda feelin'
I put that there

[Chorus]
That hundred miles of highway, between her and me
That whole lot of empty, where she used to be
That whiskey bottle smashed, in pieces on the floor
Like so many reasons she don't love me no more
That goodbye, hangin' like smoke in the air
I put that there

[Verse 3]
That pawn shop tag on a quarter-carat ring
That cover-up tattoo, over her name
That fist full of broken dreams
That hole where my heart used to be
I put that there

[Chorus]
Oh, that hundred miles of highway, between her and me
That whole lot of empty, where she used to be
That whiskey bottle smashed, in pieces on the floor
Like so many reasons she don't love me no more
That goodbye, hangin' like smoke in the air
Yeah, I put that there

[Chorus]
Yeah, that hundred miles of highway, between her and me
That whole lot of empty, where she used to be
That whiskey bottle smashed, in pieces on the floor
Like so many reasons she don't love me no more
That goodbye, hangin' like smoke in the air
Yeah, I put that there

[Outro]
Oh, I put that there
