Alright

[Verse]
To know you is to hate you
So loving you must be like suicide
Well, I don't mind
If you don't mind
Hell, I am not the one who's gonna die

I guess I just can't listen
To this one-sided conversation again
Cause I don't care
If I don't care
Well, no one ever said that life is fair

[Chorus]
Well, everybody loves a joke but no one likes a fool
And you're always cracking the same old lines again
You're well rehearsed on every verse and that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity

[Verse]
The center of attention
Got an honorable mention once again
Congratulations
And salutations
You're a figment of your own imagination

[Chorus]
Well, everybody loves a joke but no one likes a fool
And you're always cracking the same old lines again
You're well rehearsed on every verse and that was stated clear
But no one understands your verity

[Outro]
To know you is to bait you
And you fell to victim to your own denial
Well, I don't mind
If you donâ€™t mind
You're wasting all your time
