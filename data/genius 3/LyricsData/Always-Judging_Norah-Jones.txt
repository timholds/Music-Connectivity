[Intro]
Always judging, always judging
Never loving, always judging
Always judging, never hugging
Always [?], never [?]

[Verse]
Always judge the one you love
To [?] now, she's crying
(never loving, always judging)
Don't pretend that it's the end
You're bluffing, you're not dying
(always judging, never hugging)
When you say you don't need me
I do believe you're lying
(always [?], never [?]
Oh, if you say it's the end
I'll think you're never trying

[Chorus]
Always judging, always judging
Never loving, always judging
Always judging, never hugging
Always [?], never [?]
