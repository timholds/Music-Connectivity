[Intro: sample (Killa Sin)]
And by the end of this decade
Killer Bees, will have spread across most
If not, all, the continental United States
(Shit is on your neck, son, it's on your neck)

[Verse 1: Killa Sin]
Here we go again, never know w-when to throw it in
Pound a nigga out and then it's off to the show again
My comrades with me, 50's of that sticky yo
Fire came by and toss me higher than a Frisbee and
Just when you thought it was safe to fuck with me
Put a twist in the game on that ass and got grizzly now
DJs that run with your camp don't want to spin me
While the greatest niggas heavy rotate us till we dizzy

[Verse 2: Beretta 9]
Yo yo, to the foolish
Niggas think they can but yet cannot do this
Flex turn it up I said what the funk who this?!
To make the people dance and scream and jump to this
Me, BE.R.E double T.A N.I.N.E
When I'm on the M.I.C. you want no parts of me
Cause I came to rip the party up and you'll see
ShoGun, my nigga Killa Sin and Cilvaringz

[Chorus: Beretta 9 (+ Blue Raspberry background vocals)]
Yo, my niggas we don't, but do get violent
My niggas we won't, but will get violent
36/Loud, but yet remain silent
Get us a round of Rémy, we gon down it

[Verse 3: Cilvaringz]
Yo, yo it's that Wu-Tang Clan Killa Bee gang bang shit
Click bang bang with, move fantastic
Put the hammer to the back of the pistol and blast it
This is for one brother man, Rest In Peace Dirty Bastard!
I rock with the best, Loch to the Ness
Block off the rest and pop off at the chest
The great cause in effect, bang out the LP
Wu-Tang Killa Bee stinging, you screaming help me

[Verse 4: ShoGun Assason]
Heavy flow spitter, heavy dough getter
Microphone mutilator, Mr. Hater Hater
O-Hio slayer, Sho assassinator, head decapitator
I got the flavor that you save for neighbor
Like Pete Rock and Marley, coming straight out of Steubi
The cap pillar killer nigga
I put a hit out on the nigga
And bang to death like Pucky Hamma
My nigga, my nigga, my nigga nigga

[Chorus: Beretta 9 (+ Blue Raspberry background vocals)] (x2)
Yo, my niggas we don't, but do get violent
My niggas we won't, but will get violent
36/Loud, but yet remain silent
Get us a round of Rémy, we gon down it

[Outro: Blue Raspberry]
Welcome to the next chamber...
