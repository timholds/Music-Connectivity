Always on the outside
Always looking in
I was in this drop D metal band
We called Requiem
And they'd say relax
But I can't be a man this far down the map, I know
I was sold for suspect drawings
Underneath a makeshift awning
Now I'm yours, know I'm here
Read it all front and back
But I can't relax
With my knees on the ground and a stick in my back
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
I was on the outside
I was lookin' in
I was in a drop D metal band
We called Requiem
And I can't relax
With my knees on the ground and a stick in my back
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
Sister Jack
No, I can't just relax
Knowing that you're coming back, Sister Jack, I know
