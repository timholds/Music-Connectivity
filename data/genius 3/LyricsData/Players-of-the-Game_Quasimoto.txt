"We're all apart of the game!" Sample


Will smile in your face for a taste of the trees
Fallin' out of the races, stay on your Qs & Ps
Ps & Qs
Good news, bad news
Shitty reviews, a critic's appraised review
Fans will drive miles for hours to hear what you're sayin'
If you're shitty, niggas throwing bottles in their city
Leave vibrations, though a positive mind frame

It's all a part of the game
We're all players in the game!

Lose all your money, or double up
Fall off, or bubble up
Breakin' #1 on the pop charts
Or keep it real, drop sound like  art
Going wood, in the hood, or getting Grammys
Coming like Neptune or Prince Grammy

Being yourself or sounding the same
It's all apart of the game
We're all players in the game!

Fur coats, gold teeth, Raider hat
Tough guy, soft guys,hated rap

Packed show, empty nightclubs
Turn this shit into Fight Club
