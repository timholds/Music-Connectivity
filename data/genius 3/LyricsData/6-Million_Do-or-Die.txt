1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 million ways to die

Double em' when I unlock the Glock
To pop open up six more C's with ease
Seventeen at the knees
Freeze a brother like a holocall
On the call to get the tip off to rip off the Adimin
To break a chip off the other men
Did we bury the men
Cause I'm gonna carry the man
In the land where the zombie again I mean its on again
Triple beam is my only friend
Then see become reality
Damn man it's hard to breathe
Damn man it's hard to leave
So when you all deceased
Don't even guard your grill
You ain't hard to kill
Flip this bitch get rich
Closed caskets, drastic's
How I come on the mil shit
Cause on the real (shit)
I could pick off
The lick off for real
Click, get my steel fixed, shit
Doin' what I wanna do
Doin' what I gotta do
Gotta do what I wanna do, nigga
Now I can stand on that like Nor
Cut em' in two till them all in fours
If you can stand erect
Give the man a check
So watch them in a pex
He empty all the tec's
Catch the T, Italy to the B
Another enemy sprintin' to the meal
Vision of a killin spree
Body left on the Kennedy E. wherever
He say AK carry AK spray two the midday
Two 9 double M y'all, if all fall
Oppurtunity call for a kill 'em kill 'em all
Come and see what you never saw, in the raw
Six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six
I close his eyes with the middle of the index
Shoot him up with two tec's
Don't give a fuck who flex
Now ask these blue
I'm gonnask these blue chick

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Flip this bitch get rich (6 million ways to die)
Closed caskets, drastic's
How I come on the mil (You for real)
You just dead wrong (You just dead wrong)
I'm head strong in the red zone

Killing niggas is a misery
Visualize putting heads in the guillotine
Muset decide if I can't in a nigga drink slug
Gotta ride from the side on the barrel
The unseen, what I mean
Remember and rip your test go
Leavin' niggas on the scene like vegetables
And next you know
Fuckin' with the thug
(??) of blood
Put you like a rug
I'm gonna die
I'm on the ground for long
Sayin ' but this is the lid
Cause a god, bet'cha ya know
Why don't you slow down, nigga wanna throw down
Slip in in the clip and you load with the four pound
Nigga gonna pop the pill, but won't shoot to kill
So why you shoot to thrill, because your heart ain't real
I'm let loose the steel, and after I'mma peel
The brother shot, fuck a nigga
When his bod is steel
Cause I'm numb and dumb, I'm shootin' dums and um
Sucka it's just for fun, and once I'm on the run
I'm unstoppable, dropable, keep my eyes on the obstacle
Itty bitty bang bang, motherfucker to the head
Leave him dead, paint a picture red
Cause he's hard
Leave him in the darn
Nigga dis god
If you starve
Gotta deal with my mom
Nigga bawl
If you hard
Cause finish the dime is my motto
And um
It's get to rip your test go
Let's go
Done throw those water hoes
Still the same just like ago
Cause a holocall
How you feel when you dealin' with a real g

[Hook: Repeat x2]

Six million ways to die. Choose one
Six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six (Picture this, Picture this)

We treat your neighborhood like Vietnam
Everywhere I step theres a dead body
Even though they got shit on my block party
And when you see me that's no surprise
To your eyes, you realize
When I drop bombs everyone dies
It's seems to me you are the nigga sworn to test my skills
Me for real
When I come with this 187
I'm from that Ill state
And eliminating me will be impossible (Me, me)
Try to touch my body
You got to come through obstacles
Come now follow
No remorse is what your journey will be
And when ya blow me
That's when you will die instantly
Can you feel me
Got homies that was lost in the storm
Reforms of evil spirits
The seven seals is open for the chosen as is spoken
6 million ways to die
I'm a feed ya
That super natural creature
Just save the place and I'll beat ya
(??)
There's no one here provokin' us
Just scope and smoke is my mission
Competitor take a glance at the predator never ever more (lil bitch)
