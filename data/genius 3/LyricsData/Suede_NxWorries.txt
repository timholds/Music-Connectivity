[Intro: Anderson .Paak]
Hey, Yes Lawd!
Uh

[Verse 1: Anderson .Paak]
Smoother than a motherfucker
Suede on the inside
Candy paint, candy paint
I ain't gotta tell you what the rims look like
Look, I'm gripping wood like a motherfucker
She ask me, can her friend ride?
Kelly wanna have a drink
And shorty wanna pop pills all night
Look, don't be fucking with my tape deck
You gon' listen to this Marvin
You gon' to listen to this Bloodstone
Oh ya'll niggas want that Barry White?
Well, I don't really fuck with that right there
That could make a nigga act up right there
Well go and get your rocks off, boo
Nah, nah, nah
(I don't really do all that, but it's more for you)
I'm far from a pimp, but I'm close to you
You fucking with an old soul, twice removed
My pops used to work up on them fighter jets
Maybe that's the reason I be (airplane noise) through
Now who the fuck called me a player?
I ain't one these young niggas out here sweating for a pay stub
I'm a coach, I'mma teach these bitches how to layup
Now most of ya'll can't do shit
But all my chicks cook grits
And roll a spliff, at the same damn time
You ain't live long enough, to have a bitch this fine
Now if you don't mind

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
If I call you a bitch
It's cause you're my bitch
And as long as no one else call you a bitch
Then there won't be no problems
Now, if I call you a trick
It's cause you paid rent
And as long as you don't call after 6
Then there won't be any problems
Walk with me now
She with it, She with it
Keep it 300, I ain't even gotta hit it
She with it, She with it
All she wanna do is watch a real nigga winning, nigga
She with it, She with it
Look me in my eye, there'll be no simping
She with it, She with it
Gotta whole lot of women, all of them with it
Yes Lawd!

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
My momma said don't trust these hoes, boy be about your loot
(True story!)
Now if my momma told me that, why the fuck would I listen to you?
(Yes Lawd!)
Never go broke chasing riches
But you might go broke chasing every lil snake ass ho with a tongue piercing
Now

[Chorus: Anderson .Paak]
If I call you a bitch
It's cause you're my bitch
And as long as no one else call you a bitch
Then there won't be no problems
Now, if I call you a trick
It's cause you paid rent
And as long as you don't call after 6
Then there won't be any problems
Walk with me now
She with it, She with it
Keep it 300, I ain't even gotta hit it
She with it, She with it
All she wanna do is watch a real nigga winning, nigga
She with it, She with it
Look me in my eye, there'll be no simping
She with it, She with it
Gotta whole lot of women, all of them with it
Yes Lord!
