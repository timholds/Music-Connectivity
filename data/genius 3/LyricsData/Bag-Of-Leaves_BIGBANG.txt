Look at the mule in the desert now
Where are you leading me
I see no carrot
On that stick in your hand
There's a name for what
You're giving me
It's called misery
I might find other sources
To keep my spirits high
I sneak away to the basement
Lock the door and then
I turn off the lights

I had a feeling it would
Come to this
But I've got nothing but grief
I'm going against my usual routine
My lighter and my bag of leaves

Start relaxing
Slow reaction
Field of vision becomes
Wierd and clear again
We were told to say no
But I can't let go
Another good one

Then I woke up in a cold place
Drooling on my guitar
The angry sound of her voice
In my head
Saying get out and clean the yard

I had a feeling it would
Come to this
I got no other relief
I go against a lot of good advice
My lighter and my bag of leaves

Start relaxing
Slow reaction
Field of vision becomes
Wierd and clear again
Hearing something from the corner
Of your ear
Spine tingling music shimmering
Still feeling hungry
After 16 slices
We were told to say no
But I can't let go
Of another good one
