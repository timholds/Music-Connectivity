I taught the hellhound to sit
Cheatin Satan playing cards
I taught the hellhound to sit
Cheatin Satan playing cards
I pulled a knife on the devil
When he damned my heart

Well, I tease the kitchen cobras
I dare them to bite
Well the lunge - they hiss
But, the serpent thinks twice
One look at my eyes
He recoils in fright

Rough and tumble stitches and scars
Whenever I rumble it's no holds barred
And I ain't
Afraid of midnight
Well, I ain't afraid of midnight
I'll dance in that graveyard

Well, bring on that hooded bugler
He can sound his taps for me
Bring on the that hooded bugler
He can sound his taps for me
But, when the reaper comes
He best be packin heat

Rough and tumble stitches and scars
Whenever I rumble it's no holds barred
And I ain't
Afraid of midnight
Well, I ain't afraid of midnight
I'll dance in that graveyard

And I ain't
Afraid of midnight
No, I ain't
Afraid of midnight

I ain't afraid baby
I don't see ... no midnight
I'll dance in that graveyard
