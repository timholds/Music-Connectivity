Ridin Dirty, super tight, I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin Dirty, super tight, I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin Dirty, super tight, I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin Dirty, super tight, I'm with the - have y'all thinkin' I'm Barry White

[Verse 1:]
Shit, (?) what you know bout me? I play the game on key
Break a bitch, then wreck a trick for it's D-O-E
I never slipped on game so motherfuck your fame
Fifteen minutes can't compare to how I bang
Out the trunk, the Lac, the (?), slept on wild
Couldn't beat my shine unless you clean my tile
Wax on, wax off, if you a fuck nigga
They claim they shootin' where I'm ballin', good luck nigga
I still hold my nuts and cobra clutch these bucks
You hold a broke bitch down, I tell a bitch get up
If a bitch don't fuck, then a bitch gone suck
You lost site on the gold cause you talk too much
I ride around clean with my frame on lean
Fishbowl, raise the doors as I drop my screens
With a porno playing, fifteens banging
Going back to the future in my time machine
Cause I was

[Hook: x2]
