[Verse 1:]
Used to be that
I believed in something
Used to be that
I believed in love

It's been a long time
Since I've had that feeling
I could love someone
I could trust someone

I said I'd never let
Nobody near my heart again, darling
I said I'd never let nobody in

[Chorus:]
If you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever

If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever

If you asked me to
If you asked me to

[Verse 2:]
So now ever since I've been around you
Can't go back the way
And on my own

Can't help feeling, darling
Since I've found you
That I've found my home
That I'm finally home

I said I'd never let
Nobody get to close to me, darling
I said I needed
Needed to be free

[Repeat Chorus:]
If you asked me to
I just might change my mind
And let you in my life forever

If you asked me to
I just might give my heart
And stay here in your arms forever
If you asked me to

[Bridge:]
And I would give my world
Little baby, I need you now
Ask me to and
I would do anything for you, baby
For you, baby

[Repeat Chorus:]
If you asked me to
I'll put you in my life forever
If you asked me to

All you gotta do is ask me to
If you want it
I could give you my heart

If you asked me to
I'll give you anything that I say, baby
If you asked me to

I'll do anything that you want me to do
Just ask me
All you gotta do is ask me to

If you asked me to
I'll give my life
All you gotta do is ask me to
If you asked me to
