Well i ain't got much time so i'll get to the point
Do you want to share a ride and get the fuck out of this joint?
Well i got an impulse so repulsive that it burns
And i want to break your heart until it makes your stomach turn

Well i gotta know if you're the one who got away
Even though it was never meant to be
Stay, Oh stay the night!
'cause we're running out of time!
Stay, Oh stay the night!
I dont want to say goodbye
Stay, Oh stay the night!
'cause we're running out of time!
So stay the night!
I dont want to say goodbye

Well you're so sick and tired of feeling so alone
I dont understand the point if you have to go home
So won't you stay and count the circles 'round my eyes?
And we can watch the stars until the sun begins to rise

Well i gotta know if you're the one who got away
Even though it was never meant to be
Stay, Oh stay the night!
'cause we're running out of time!
Stay, Oh stay the night!
I dont want to say goodbye
Stay, Oh stay the night!
'cause we're running out of time!
So stay the night!
I dont want to say goodbye

Well i gotta know if you're the one who got away
Even though it was never meant to be
Stay, Oh stay the night!
'cause we're running out of time!
Stay, Oh stay the night!
I dont want to say goodbye
Stay, Oh stay the night!
'cause we're running out of time!
So stay the night!
I dont want to say goodbye
