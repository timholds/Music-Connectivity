[Intro]
Yeah! Look

[Verse]
I seen you on some funny shit too
I seen you ran out
When the money did too
Now you fucking with some baller size 26 shoe
But that pussy cumming quick, what a waterfront view
Put your girl on I heard she becoming rich too
Suck a hundred dicks Now you're playing subtle bitch? Cool
Quit school; got problems and issues Drugs and pistols
You dreamed of this shit too
Come again, come again Fucking thundering Stomach pains
Who's the one to blame for the hunger games
Money came, money went, money spent
Fuck the rent Ignorant boys run game until we run the game
Hear but you don't listen See but you don't envision
Cars come with no ignition Up north with the coldest bitches
Never codependent till you get to co-defendant
Got robbed and told the homies that you sold the pendant
This some do or die Talking like it's you and I
You loved me even though you knew this shit was suicide
Who decides, baby who decides?
Who dies? Who lives? Who shall move aside?
We're seeing young boys dying over foolish pride
What the fuck is color if we all feeling blue inside?
Seen the man in the mirror and told him "move aside"
Tell me, who am I? Tell me, who am I?

[Outro]
Who decides, baby who decides?
Who decides, baby who decides?
Who am I, baby who am I?
Who am I, baby who am I?
Who decides, baby who decides?
Who decides, baby who decides?
Who am I, baby who am I?
Who am I, baby who am I?
