[Verse 1]
Well I'm flying high and feeling low
Drinking hard and dancing slow
I'm going to shine my buckle to George Jones
Heartaches are hot on my heels, bartender the race is on
She's gone for good and I'm going to town
I'm going to live it up, you living her down
Jose pick me up and get me on my feet
So I can scoot a boot to that two-four jukebox beat

[Chorus]
I'm heartbroke out of my mind
Pardon me boys if I get a little out of line
It's just temporary insanity
Until I get over what she did to me
I'll be heart-broke out of my mind

[Verse 2]
I brought my own trouble tonight
I'm going to get this
Being done wrong down right
You saddle me up boys I'm going in
They say when you fall off
Well climb right back up again

[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's just temporary insanity
Till I get over what she did to me
I'll be heartbroke out of my mind
Oh I'm just heartbroke out of my mind
