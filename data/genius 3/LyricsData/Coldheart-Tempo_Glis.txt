I find it difficult to remember
The last night of December
When we bowed our heads
And waved our hands and parted ways

And when the sun came up in the morning
I had an appetite for disowning
All the things that I ever shared
Or thought I had with you

So I'll try, try to remember
The last night of December
But the pain inside my heart
Is forcing all the love in life away

I try to think of a time
And let the memories unfold
But it just slips away
And all the tempos are slowed

So I drink it all away
And sleep through the days
I'm closing off to this world
I think it's better this way

So I'll try, try to remember
The last night of December
But the pain inside my heart
Is forcing all the love in life away
