Nah, I couldn't feel you if I touch you
Why juice with the hate nigga I f*ck you
Feel the rush like..
Or yet wrong in the jump suit f*cking with us too
Uh I'm from the bubble that birthday
The motherland keep us other land
Came my nigga 24 but on another hand
Line for line punch harder than rumbling
I repeat I don't stud her
I might beat but I don't love her
But that don't mean I don't want her
I got an ice box where my heart was I bleed with blood god
So close to the edge all I need
Was a hard budge
Yeah call me to spot blood
'cause a flood the way you get washed up
Make you sound like the guitar us
See I'm tryin get it, all yo're tryin to do is take it
And all you're tryin do is fake it
See life's a bitch adn I love it when she naked
It's your favorite rapper favorite
See I puff that loud
Yeah we got hit that a pump that crowd
Pump that loud
Ran through the teen you wanna cuff that now
So first I tell em f*ck that style
Switch it, I'm getting better by a minute
That's 'cause I live it and you're focused on the dig it
You live it..like ..Vanily really you're silly
You ain't' writing you ain't nice
It's really the milly that got you hot
Maybe gangsta probalby not
Everybody shooting nobody shot
All this rapers spitting bars nobody hot
Line..all time great papa and ..
