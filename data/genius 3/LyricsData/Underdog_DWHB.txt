Idiosyncratic flows, down the sink, there it goes
Led to the honeys like secreting pheromones
Sharp like a razor, man we ain’t talking camera phones
Yeah we done nailed it, go ahead get your hammer on
Expand upon your thesis, what, you think you the best or somethin'?
Well we’ve all said that before, man, you’re just fucking parrotin'
Don’t mean to ruffle your feathers, but you get a demerit, son
For thinking after watching the throne, you’ll inherit it
You’re just a kid, go to camp, pitch a tent, tie a knot
I know your mommy said you’re special, but dude I’m sorry you’re not
So take a hike, tell ghost stories, maybe make yourself a s’more
And get back to us when your shit ain’t such a motherfucking bore
Board yourself up in a cabin, it worked for Bon Iver
But honestly, we’d probably all forget you’re even there
Don’t act like you’re better than us, not even au pair
You got a pie in your pants like you’re playing Double Dare

[Hook]
If it's not my turn, well then I can wait
Cause it's coming around soon, well at least I think so
I don't care what you've got to say
The underdog is here to stay
Don't you know you will rue the day
When you promised that our dreams would blow away
I don't care what you've got to say
The underdog is here to stay

[Andrew]
Yup yup yup, we got heat
Staying right up on that fire like some chopped meat
And I ain't try to come across like I was cocky
But there ain't nothing you can say that's gonna stop me
I'm so fucking sadistic when it comes to this sick shit
So hard, when the beat hits, you'll call Dr. Lipschitz
Fuck a ballistic, keep rising and rising
Never come down--what, you thought this shit was surprising?
I make my own rules and I play my own game
Keep perfecting my own, while y’all staying the same
What you're saying is lame; put some fucking heart in it
I'm just trying to be real, I ain't trying to start with it
Can you explain to me how it's plain to see
Everywhere I look, just fucking lames and me?
And I’ve been putting in work patiently
So one day it's all gonna change, you see. I fucking swear it

In the dark days, in alleyways, they get your revenue
They grabbing you, they grasping you, like “Who the fuck you running to?”
Cause Superman is busy with Lex Luthor and Doomsday
Now you’re in a jam cause you took a shortcut of hearsay
And today, you thought to take the dark, ominous path
Saw the 2 plus 2, but forgot to figure the math
Now they getting away with all your cents and your cash
Thinking, “If the Dog was here, then he’d be whooping your ass!”
Never fear, we are here, yeah the underdogs is here
Striking fear up in here, so you never have to shed a tear
Grab a beer, cause the worst is already behind you
I’ll be right there when trouble is ready to find you
For the geeks, for the nerds, and the dorks and all
Man, and I’ll be right there when you ain’t standing tall
You should never ever worry cause I ain’t far at all
To come through and save the underdog in us all

[Cheldon McQueen]
It was all a dream, I used to read Playboy magazine
For all forever every hater get the middle fing
Was usually tied up tripping on every little thing
But now I'm dumb, cause I don't even know what little means
Now my team calling shots from the limousine
With more juice in our system than a lemon press
When's the last time you heard em iller than McQueen?
Lemme guess
We are the underdogs of gods
That's too raw for stars so I guess this means war
Life's still a beach, so I guess this means sure
Already gave em the world, so I guess this means more
Breath taken from Tuesdays before
Before the underdogs were over the billboards
No more religion I guess my jeans off
Took a step forward, looked up, guess what I saw
A bunch of kids that’s Just happy to meet him
Just happy to see him
Be just happy to be him
Hop up in the BM, take me back to liam
Back to the future I'm just happy to lead em
Feel like a boss, could it be just another Ross
Gifted and cold, could it be just a colored Claus
But Santa couldn't add this to his planner
The underdogs? No, we this summer's Gods
