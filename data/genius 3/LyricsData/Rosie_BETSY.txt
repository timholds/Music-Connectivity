[Verse 1]
Why must the young die so young?
Before they're allowed to bloom
And your mama, no, she ain't ever gonna be the same, no
With that picture frame and the pieces left behind

[Refrain]
Yes, may your wings carry you high, sweet Rosie

[Verse 2]
One last teenage flight of lust
Like feathers in the dust, we rise
And I'm calling out, calling out for time to reverse
But that clock has chimed and the bird has flown

[Refrain]
Yes, may your wings carry you high, sweet Rosie

[Verse 3]
No no no, no you know your mama
She ain't ever gonna be the same, oh no
'Cause the devil he made light
He made light with your life
And your mama won't be the same, no, 'til you fly on home
