A bucket list full of nothing but love interests/
Musical acquisitions, and uninhabited substances/
Custom fit JYAK hoodies, hashtags, and failed-to-book-me's/
Been stuck at 1k on twitter, since minneap overlooked me/
How the tides turned, as i watch the night burn/
Let the ice churn, tell em all that i learned/
Like... if you make a change from the money that you earn/
People start to question what the kid was ever really worth/
And you only miss friends, when they levitate from Earth/
Heard that each death is accompanied by birth/
But its hard to understand, when they're six feet under dirt/
And you're sposed to live life like youve never known hurt/
So i sit and reminisce from my rooftop perched/
Pad on my lap, breaking grams of this purp/
Knowing too damn well, getting high to solve a low/
Only means, from what im told, you never loved yourself first/
Like i only loved you, and you only loved God/
So you said that things change, stick to plan, i just nod/
And I'm giving you facade, and i fake it like its real/
And i give it to a broad, having sex but never feel nothing/
Never feel touched, and never really accustomed to getting up in/
The morning, making you eggs, but i do it cuz you love it/
And i do you cuz you love it, and i do me cuz I'm told/
You lose yourself up on this road, i never wanna be a puppet/
Pulling strings for you girl, sing for you girl/
Cuz ive been around the map, still got a thing for you girlll/
And those dark blue eyes, and that curly brown hair/
And that full mouth smile, that had put me right here/
Youre my heroine.... both the woman and my drug/
Drinking in the car, cuz i couldn't in the club/
Looking at the stars, and i shoulda called it love/
But i didn't cuz its not, and i wouldn't, cuz I'm young, and feeling restlesss/

(chorus)

I wish that that i could take that heroine away from you/
Wish that i could put my foot up on the breaks for you/
I wish that i could take that belt around your waist from you/
There ain't a day, i dont think of meeting at heavens gates with you all/
I think my self deprecation/
Kept you impatient, and pacing, making it look to me like both our hearts breaking/
I found a mystery woman, found a mystery woman/
Thought if i repeated myself, then maybe history wouldn't./
Another summer, another parallel/
Another truth that I'm too scared to tell/
The same tempo on that carousel./
But this the end, jay baruchel/
