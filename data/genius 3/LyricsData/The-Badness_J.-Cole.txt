[Verse 1: J.Cole]
Yea, keep following me, keep calling me
Yea, yea, yea

Ay, believe in God like the sun up in the sky
Science can tell us how it can't tell us why
I seen a baby cry then seconds later she laughed
The beauty of life, the pain never lasts
The rain always past, the sun donâ€™t always shine
When its gone I'm lonely, but when its there Im fine
I hate the winter time because the nights come quicker
The light make them whites think Im a nice young nigga
But at night they think twice and walk a little faster
Its funny, 100 years ago I woulda called this nigga master
How the tables turn but still the fire burning huh
I feel the heat the world is a dryer turning, turning
Im looking for some higher learning, learning
Girl you what I desire, yearning, yearning
You say Im easily distracted I think the problem is Im easily attracted by the darkside
The temptation got me questioning where my heart lies
I'm tryna separate myself like apartheid
But ay the liquor keep swallowing
I swear I walk with God but the devil keep following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following
I say the devil keep following, following

[Verse 2: Omen]
Feel like I'm riding on a chartered plane of broken hearted pain
Turbulence is constant my pilot has gone insane
If I can find a parachute to parasail
Maybe these parasites of paranoia won't prevail
Character dope as hell, but where is my parallel sweetheart
Deep thoughts lost in my brain so I sleep hard
Nights with no progress
Mane im thinking like I'll probably find a Loch Ness
In the projects before I find this
Object of my love, this object of my heart
Guitar strings have strum in search of my counterpart
Bound to start drinking or smoking, sinking this ocean
Leaping through the badness hoping Im reaching for closeness

Feel like the devil keep following me
Feel like the devil keep following me
