Korean Lyrics

[Verse 1: Crush]
하루가 지나도 울리지 않는 폰
이젠 이런 기다림이 더 익숙해진걸
모래시계처럼 쌓이는 한숨과는 반대로
너에 대한 내 기대는 서서히 줄어들어
믿었었어 바빴다면서
어색한 핑계를 늘어놓는 널 봐도
몰랐었어 내심 알았는지도
그저 네가 변했다는 사실을
믿기 싫었을 뿐

[Chorus: Jeff Bernat]
Tell me what to do
I don't know what to do
Your love is just a memory
Baby it’s your last time to
Give me your best try
And to give your heart to me

[Verse 2: DEΔN]
대체 왜이래 그만해 이제
이별 노래에 가사처럼 변해가는 너의 말
It seems like over to us 잦은 다툼 속
의미 없는 상처를 남기고
전부 되돌리기엔 너무 늦은 듯해
부질없어 전부를 쏟아도
결국엔 채워지지 않을 너처럼
이젠 알겠어 원래 알았는지도
이별은 예정된 결말처럼
우리 앞에 놓인걸

[Chorus: Jeff Bernat & DEΔN]
Tell me what to do
I don't know what to do
Your love is just a memory
(Your love is just a memory)
Baby it’s your last time to
Give me your best try
And to give your heart to me
Take it to the bridge

[Verse 3: DEΔN & Crush]
얼마나 많은 생각이 오갔는지 Baby
(누군가는 마지막을 말해야겠지)

[Chorus: Jeff Bernat & Crush & DEΔN]
Tell me what to do
I don't know what to do
Your love is just a memory
Baby it’s your last time to
Give me your best try
And to give your heart to me
(No more
This love is over)
Tell me what to do
I don't know what to do
Your love is just a memory
I don't know what you're
Sayin' no more
Baby it’s your last time to
Give me your best try
And to give your heart to me
(Whatever you want
Whatever you saying
We know is over)

English

[Verse 1: Crush]
A day passes but my phone doesn’t ring
Now I’ve gotten more used to waiting
My sighs build up like the sand in an hourglass
On the other hand, my expectations for you are slowly decreasing
I believed in you when you gave awkward excuses, saying you’re busy
I saw you but I didn’t know
Maybe I knew on the inside
I just didn’t wanna believe that you changed

[Chorus: Jeff Bernat]
Tell me what to do
I don’t know what to do
Your love is just a memory
Baby, it’s your last time
To give me your best try
And to give your heart to me

[Verse 2: DEΔN]
Why are you doing this? Stop it
Like the lyrics of a break up song
Your words are changing
It seems like over to us
Meaningless scars are left behind in our frequent fights
It seems like it’s too late to turn things around
Even if I spill out my all, you won’t be filled up in the end
Now I know, maybe I always knew
Our break up is like a predicted ending
It’s right there in front of us (Yeah yeah)

[Chorus: Jeff Bernat & DEΔN]
Tell me what to do
I don’t know what to do
Your love is just a memory
(Your love is just a memory, yeah)
Baby, it’s your last time to
Give me your best try
And to give your heart to me
(to give me your best try ah)

[Bridge: DEΔN & Crush]
Take it to the bridge
Yeah yeah yeah
(ay you know?)
So many thoughts came and went baby
Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah
Someone needs to say it’s over

[Chorus: Jeff Bernat & Crush & DEΔN]
Tell me what to do
I don’t know what to do
Your love is just a memory
Baby, it’s your last time
To give me your best try
And to give your heart to me
(No more, this love is over)

Tell me what to do
I don’t know what to do
Your love is just a memory
(I don’t know what to sayin’ no more)
Baby, it’s your last time
To give me your best try
And to give your heart to me
(Whatever you want
Whatever you saying
We know is over)
