[Intro]
Good Lord we back one mo' 'gin
This for the people, this for the have-nots..
I know what you going through
I know what you dealing with on the daily, you feel me?
Ain't nothing but sunshine from here..
Let's get high

[Hook]
Sippin' on this drank don't ease my pain
Lord, I wish it would
Smoking all this weed don't make me sane
But it should
In a world that's down and out
In a world that's down and out

[Verse 1]
I got my back against the wall
Once again, I've been cornered
Smoke that roach from my ash tray
From the other day and down this last Corona
That I scrape for, gotta make more
Gotta get mine cause when I get time
I'mma get shine and clear my runway
And wait 'til I get signed
To stretch my wings and fly
Do what I gotta do to get by
See the world through my third eye
Would answer the things I worried about
At the end of days, bills to pay
If it's a white man's world, am I still a slave
To the minimum wage?
Keep words minimal, subliminal
Y'all won't make it anyway
Out the traps they set
Follow them tracks they left to the White House
And tell Oprah Winfrey I don't need no chicken
Bitch is gonna turn my lights out
On a daily basis
Piece of American Pie they cut me, I can barely taste it
But I know it ain't 'bout shit cause my grandma ain't make it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Can't take that for granted though
I'm still searching for antidotes
Niggas outchea sick from the money they spent
Trying to get more cars and clothes and hoes
That really know they poles, is that on earth winning y'all?
Is every woman in a sundress, really down for the cause?
I can't be sure, nowadays everybody 'bout dough
About the play, a queen to be? A gold digger? I can't even say
But either way I strap up, wrap up
Cause I don't want no capsules after
A rock-a-bye that I deny cause she stay on heads like tassels
And that's not to say ain't no queens around my way
I seen one the other day, but she had bruises on her face
And cried to me that men ain't shit and she fed up
They only want her with her legs up
Even though her nose swollen and eye was closed
I told her keep her head up

[Hook]
