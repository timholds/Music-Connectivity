[Verse 1]
My Maria, don't you know I've come a long, long way
I been longin' to see her, when she's around she takes my blues away
Sweet Maria, the sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies

[Chorus]
My Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you girl) (Oh, my Maria)
Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you, girl)
(Maria) I love you

[Verse 2]
My Maria, there were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back, my peace of mind
Gypsy lady, you're a miracle work for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea

[Bridge]
She is the sunlight when skies are grey
She treats me so right lady take me away

[Chorus]
My Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you girl) (Oh, my Maria)
Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you, girl)
(Maria) I love you

My Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you girl) (Oh, my Maria)
Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you, girl)
(Maria) I love you

My Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you girl) (Oh, my Maria)
Maria (Oh, Maria, I love you, girl)
(Maria) I love you
