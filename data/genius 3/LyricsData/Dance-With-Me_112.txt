I see you looking at me
I can tell by your eyes that your feeling me
And I really want you to get close to me
So won't you dance with me... Dance with me
My drop tops in the parking lot
And I wanna take you back to my spot
But we still got a little more time to rock
So won't you dance with me... Dance with me!
[Slim]
I can see you over there just chillin' with your girlfriends
Can't believe you're by yourself you should be here with me
Chillin' with me
Drinkin' with me, freakin' with me. Oooohhh whoa, whoa!
I see you looking at me
I can tell by your eyes that your feeling me
And I really want you to get close to me
So won't you dance with me... Dance with me
My drop tops in the parking lot
And I wanna take you back to my spot
We can snuggle a little, more time to us
So won't you dance with me... Dance with me!
[Slim]
I can see it in your eyes that your looking at the time
You wanna leave this party and I know you wanna leave with me
To chill with me, to drink with me, to freak with me, oh baby!
I see you looking at me
I can tell by your eyes that your feeling me
And I really want you to get close to me
So won't you dance with me... Dance with me
My drop tops in the parking lot
