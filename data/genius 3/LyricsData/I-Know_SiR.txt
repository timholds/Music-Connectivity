[Verse 1]
Twenty-nine, damn she fine, wine
Got the bong, eat the brie, press rewind, I'm right behind
Jameson, ginger ale, straight to the face, want a taste
All it take is a couple bands, I'm just sayin', hit the D
Ya, papa knows she the champ, heavyweight from the waist below
Stripper club, she the star of the fuckin' show
Watch her go, but don't you do nothin' but watch
'Cause she got

[Chorus]
Bad-ass kids, she got bad-ass kids
She got bad-ass kids, them some bad-ass kids
She got bad-ass kids, she got bad-ass kids (ay, ay, ay)
I know who your baby mama really is
I know who your baby mama really is
I know who your baby mama really is
I know who your baby mama really is
I know who your baby mama really is

[Verse 2]
Anywhere you wanna go she done been before
Heavens doors, way below, down to the floor
Betsy [?] put her on the bill
And I bet she kill, make the deal
She won't break her word, no, she never will
Anything for the dollar bill, for the dollar bill
Anything for the dollar bill, for the dollar bill
Gotta buy a little teeny [?] he meet on the road
So if you want, I know that lil mama will
Just to feed them

[Chorus]
Bad-ass kids, she got bad-ass kids
She got bad-ass kids, them some bad-ass kids
She got bad-ass kids, she got bad-ass kids (ay, ay, ay)
I know who your baby mama really is
I know who your baby mama really is
I know who your baby mama really is
I know who your baby mama really is
I know who your baby mama really is
