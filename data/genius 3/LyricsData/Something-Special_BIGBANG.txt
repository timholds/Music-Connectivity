Did you ever write my name with a fountain pen
In your books or on your desk
Or did you tell your friends
That I was someone special
Did you ever lie awake the entire night
Glowing in the dark with no sheets or light
Thinking that I was someone special
You got me running
Running late at night
Trying to find you
And I started thinking
Thinking all the time
But what could I do

I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But it's a mystery

Did you change your clothes did you hesitate
Walking back and forth, always being late
Cause I was someone special
Did you ever take a shower did you wash your face
Making up the bed thinking just incase
That I was someone special
You got me running
Running late at night
Trying to find you
And I started thinking
Thinking all the time
But what could I do

I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But now it's a mystery

You got me running
Running late at night
Trying to find you
And I started thinking
Thinking all the time
But what could I do

I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But it's a mystery
I had something for you
Was there something for me
I had something to give you
But it's a mystery

Something special
