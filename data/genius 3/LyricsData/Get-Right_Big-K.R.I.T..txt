Ok, this is just an anthem for tha playas
Top notch boppers, and the pimp's with tha gators, rollerskaters smoked out elevators
Drinks sippin', paint flippin' congregators
Lets get right, Lets get right, Lets get right, Lets get right
All night, all night, all night
Party like it’s 1999

[Verse 1]
1,2,1,2,1,2 I got plenty
Breaking hoes four in the mornin' ain't many
Playa, playa play on, roller skate on
I get my chase on, for someone to take home
Now who you watinin' on? uh
Freaking with me she got Beat
Till she shook and went to sleep
You think she don’t cheat
She suckin', she fuckin' 'cause she love the way I spit it
I know she only want me for my dick but I can dig it
I dig her, there's nothing iller
Kinda killer, like jack the ripper
That's way before I drink the liquor
My moves are major can’t do no favors
For chickens with cruel intentions of layin' eggs to get to my paper
Plenty pimpin nah I ain’t trickin
Ain't never slippin’, hella liffted when we piffin
Stuck to the cellin', you smell the vapors when we roll by
So crack a seal pour up and get right...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Back up, back up, cause it’s on
Break of dawn, poppin' tops, takin' shots, vibin' to the early morn’
I ain’t trippin if I make it home, tryin’ to bone
Taking pictures of bad bitches and save em in my phone
BBM in me on the late night, take flight, on my base pipes
Searchin' for jaws like great whites
Ain't that some shit? yeah, thats some shit
You claimed that was your girl but why she all up on my tip?
Don’t need to buck cause you get fucked up in this party
Chickitty check your self before I finish what you started
Get retarded hella stupid in the mix line up
Knock em down dominoes in this bitch
Drink ain’t free, drink on me
Store run gotta take my whip cause your tanks on E?
Its all good
I got a little doe to blow, buy a case of Ole E' and some blunts to roll

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Feelin good, drink got me feelin' fine
Doing what a playa does, smokin' just to ease my mind
Foreva gettin on, ridin' chrome, poppin ass pros won't leave it alone
I said these poppin ass pros won't leave it alone
All day, all night I can’t be faded
Too cold on hoes they ain’t for savin
Get right, get throwed, feel like we’ve made it
How could you hate? congratulate
