[Verse 1]
I'm a fool, crazy fool
Walking off those sapphire blues, carrying my shoes
Drinking in these drunken stares
Unprepared, I don't care

[Chorus]
Fall in love, failing love
Stranger things have happened to me
Fall in love, failing love
Stranger things have happened to me

[Verse 2]
When the rain hits your face
I feel like an actress in your embrace
Dreaming of what's to come
I'm so high, so, so high

[Chorus]
Fall in love, failing love
Stranger things have happened to me
Fall in love, failing love
Stranger things have happened to me

[Bridge]
Stranger things have happened
Stranger things have happened

[Outro]
I'm in love, so in love
Stranger things have happened
(Fall in love) failing love
Stranger things have happened to me

Stranger things have happened
