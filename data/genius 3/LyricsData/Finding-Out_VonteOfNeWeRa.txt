Getting blunted on the balcony
Overlooking mothafuckers who looked down on Me
Turned nothing into something that's that Alchemy
Broke the power level scanner when they scouted on me
I’m from Valdosta -- I’ll Make that city of proud of me
The Sour diesel got me high as the angels  looking for out for me
The way I
Move divine (the vine) like I’m swinging in and out of trees
((yea yea yea))
Sprouted wings
By any means, I’m
Living out my dream
Young “Martin X Malcolm King”
I feel a weight has been
Uplifted like a Power clean
Freedom has sound this how it ring
Bout to blow up don't be Badaboom (by the boom) like badabing
Walking barefoot across a lava stream
It's no sweat, you either roll with the punches, throw em back or you Bob n weave

This the new
Rocky theme, I will not retreat
As long as I'm allowed to fight a hockey team


If you looking for me I ain't hiding out
I ain't got no time to waste I been riding out
Tried to bury me alive but I'm climbing out
They ain't know about me then, now they finding out
Yea I still feel the pain... I block it out
Don’t be killing all the vibes the shit Not allowed
What they talking bout it’s going how we plotted out

They ain't know about me then

Now they finding out
Now they finding out
Now they finding out
It's on the line right now
Now they finding out



We don’t keep in touch but you Still feel me
Make a killing even if it will kill me
Chill Put you in yo place like I deal realty
Make a hit dog then we’ll Holla like I feel guilty (a hit dog will holler)

I Hit the bedrock n kept digging through
Simply refuse to give in when it;s difficult
My latin fans say “homes cold” like Igloo (“holmes cold”)
And What I smoke bomb like a ninja tool






Sleeping on the floors, like me n my apartment

Barely above water like a Shark fin
One bill away from a park bench
And One song away from the billboard chart list
So I’m Taking large Risk
Maneuvering through darkness
Regardless
I push the farthest despite hardships
I'm not the one start with

They know I'm so Ill if you play this whip you get  car sick

Getting blown like tree branches in a  harsh wind
You can't discount it they wanna hear every bar-again (discount/bargain)

On the rise who gone stop me?
Once  I hit top 3 I ain't going Back N forth like we arguing

When the full moon gone bitch I'm still a werewolf
All wins
Noelle's like a Christmas carrol  (No L’s/Noelle)

Been in peril overcame it, I can't fall back
I went all in, I'll a win it all back, all facts


If you looking for me I ain't hiding out
I ain't got no time to rest I been riding out
They tried to bury me alive but I'm climbing out
They know about then but they finding out
Yea I still feel the pain... I block it out
Don’t be killing all the vibes the shit Not allowed
What they talking bout it’s going how we plotted out

They ain't know about me then
Now they finding out
Now they finding out
Now they finding out
Its on the line right now


It's all on the line
My life on the line,..
It's all on the line

Bridge

One time for the fam, for the fam one time
One time for the city, one time for the city
Shout out to the fam, to the fam one time
One time for the city, one time for the city


Fuck with me come fuck with me
I stuck with who stuck with me


I know you know wassup with me
