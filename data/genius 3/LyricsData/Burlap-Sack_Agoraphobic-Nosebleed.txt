Plow and cart slowly dragged over bodies
Hemp seed trenched through shallow graves

The smoke screen as hope springs eternal
With stench and decay

Nurtured and loved
Throat slit and hung inside a drying shed

Complacency blossoms
Into inescapable grief

From stock to stem
To flower and leaf

A stream of piss
Becomes a river of blood
Bridging out to the sea

Like ashes
Our memories
Are just washed away
