[Chorus: Wandaz]
Flavour in the air Cause we can go together if you want to be a pair
I caught you from a glimpse shawty when I took a step
That you got that brand new flavour in the air
Now who got that brand new flavour in the air
Cause we can go together if you want to be a pair
I caught you from a glimpse shawty when I took a step
That you got that brand new flavour in the air

[Verse 1:Wandaz]
I saw from a distance shawty and I can't deny
That I smelt that flavoured fragrance when you passed me by
And it explains why these other broads been acting funny
Cause you bout that independent grind you like the money
And the way move your assets girl that's so attractive
Booty so big looking like you rapped a package
Of that dynamite
Cause girl your ass the BOMB
Especially when u rock them jeans that make me see your thong
If you blow that Cheech and Chong we can call the dope-man
If you ain't about that life then we can switch the program
Are you bout that freaky shit or do you like to romance
Cause we can wine and dine, or we can sip on
Coke cans
Do you like to slow dance or do you like it fast 
Cause we can make it last if we know each other's paths 
So do you like to slow dance or do you like it fast 
Cause we can make it last if we know each other's past 

[Chorus: Wandaz]
Flavour in the air Cause we can go together if you want to be a pair
I caught you from glimpse shawty when i took a step
That you got that brand new flavour in the air
Now who got that brand flavour in the air
Cause we can go together if you want to be a pair
I caught you from glimpse shawty when i took a step
That you got that brand new flavour in the air
