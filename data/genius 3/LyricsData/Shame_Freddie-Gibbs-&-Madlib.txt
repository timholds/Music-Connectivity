[Intro –The Manhattans ]
It’s 2 AM and the place is gonna close
(Yeah, time to shut it on down baby, you know what I'm sayin'?)
The bartender looks as though he knows
(You sure you want to do this shit tonight because it might hurt baby, you know what I'm sayin'?)
Everybody’s, everybody’s been at home
(Might hurt you when I, get up in the morning and leave, you know what I mean)
Here we sit…
(Take that walk you know what I mean?)

[Verse 1: Freddie Gibbs]
Slammin'
When I hit you up I'm talking about bangin' something
Chill off in your crib and have a thing, probably make it stank or something
Girl you like my bottom bitch, post my bail, pay for my lawyer
Play your position when them other hoes get out of order
When you wanna give me that pussy? You purchase a plane ticket
Run around town, when I bust her down they want shit like them lames did it
Got her dick whipped, my dick smeared with lipstick
Basically if this bitch lay with me she payin' me, I'm on some pimp shit
For real! It's 2 A.M. club was bout' to close up
Thumbing through my contacts bout' to call one of my hoes up
Then I met you, kicked game and followed you to the breakfast spot
Fucked you like I married you that night up in the Marriot
Screaming like you got your cherry popped
Fucking, switching up positions
Thought this shit would never stop
Motherfuck an intermission
Damn!

(Here we are again)

[Hook: BJ The Chicago Kid]
It ain't got to be the walk of shame, baby
But that's only if you know the game, baby
Later I can't be the one to blame, baby
But for now take the walk of shame, baby
It ain't got to be the walk of shame, baby
But that's only if you know the game, baby
Later I can't be the one to blame, baby
But for now take the walk of shame, baby

[Verse 2: Freddie Gibbs]
Straight Slammin'
Sleepin' with pistols under my pillow
We wake and bake, she up naked twistin' up cigarillos
I beat that Thursday night and Friday morning, off to work she go
Time to take that walk, just take this dick, don't take it personal
Your friends probably gonna call you a ho, what you trippin' on
Them bitches want a grip from the same dick you be sitting on
And your girl Monique, she be hitting me when her nigga gone
Trying to buy some weed she proceed with nothing but Vicky's on
Nothing but ass and titties, but I let that ass convince me
Took it in that, hit that, wish I could say it was accidentally
Like I stepped on a banana peel and fell in that pussy
Y'all niggas be spending all kind of scrill to get in that pussy
And she cop a seven every Friday
Chuck the deuces at her baby daddy as I pulled up out the drive-way
For real
