[Jennifer Lopez]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

[will.i.am]
Woo hoo!
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...
Woo hoo!
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...

Imma go hard, hard to the core
Hard like motherfucking liquid swords
Harder than worldwide stadium tours
I am the future, DeLorian's doors

Will he survive? Never deceased
I don't think I'm ever gon' rest in peace
Imma kill the game, leave the rest in pieces
Now everybody want my recipes

Tell a jelaous chicken I don't know what the beef is
I'm just making money for my grandkids' nieces
Imma work hard, that's my basis
This beat is a shit, feces

Pardon me ma'am, imma go dumb
Small.i.am, I'm complicated, hard.i.am
I end the beginning, then starting again

[Jennifer Lopez]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

[will.i.am]
Woo hoo!
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...
Woo hoo!
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...

You can get that, or you can get this
You can call it demon, imma call it Jesus
You can get a curse, you can get a cross
You can go to work, or you can be the boss

Imma be the owner, be a thought donor
Imma go hard, like a motherfuckin' boner
Imma make the beat put the people in a coma
You can be a geek or be a Rolling Stoner

I woke up in the morning
Hard like morning wood in the morning
Woke up thinking about microphoning
E.T. own the mic phone to Homeland

I wait out like NASA
I'm way over here, I done passed ya
I get stacks of cash, you get cashews
I go hard, statues

[Jennifer Lopez]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

Now let me take this time to say
I don't wanna lead you on
You can go hard or you can go home
Well I, I know it is a lot to take
I don't wanna lead you on
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard

[will.i.am]
Woo hoo!
Wait a minute, imma make it a little harder
Imma make it a little harder
Give it to you a little harder
This is hard

[Mick Jagger]
Hard like a rock 'n' roll
Time bombs ticking, explode
Baby, this is dynamo
Better move back now
It's 'bout to blow

Hard like geometry
And trigonometry
This is crazy
Psychology

Get it baby
I'm 'bout to win
Watch out now
I'm going in

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard...
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard...

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard, you can go home
You can go hard, you can go home
You can go hard...
