I will not fail, won't fade away
I won't give into the violence
I will not drown, I will not rage
I won't get lost in the silent screams
That fall on me

I'm sick of
Getting torn down
I'm sick of
Getting back up
I'm sick of
Getting torn down
I know I'm stronger
Getting torn down
I'm sick of
Getting back up
I'm sick of
Getting torn down
I know I'm stronger

I have been scarred, I have been chained
I've been alone with the darkness
I've been the freak, I've felt the pain
But I won't be shattered by all this hate
No I'm not afraid

I'm sick of
Getting torn down
I'm sick of
Getting back up
I'm sick of
Getting torn down
I know I'm stronger
Getting torn down
I'm sick of
Getting back up
I'm sick of
Getting torn down
I know I'm stronger

And I, I will rise up, I will survive
And I, I carry on, cause I am alive

I'm sick of
Getting torn down
I'm sick of
Getting back up
I'm sick of
Getting torn down
I know I'm stronger
Getting torn down
I'm sick of
Getting back up
I'm sick of
Getting torn down
I know I'm stronger

Getting torn down
I'm sick of
Getting back up
I'm sick of
Getting torn down
I know I'm stronger
Getting torn down
I'm sick of
Getting back up
I'm sick of
Getting torn down
I know I'm stronger, stronger
