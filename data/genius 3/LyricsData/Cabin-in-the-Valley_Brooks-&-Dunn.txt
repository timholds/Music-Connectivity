Today, I climbed the hillside with the snowcapped evergreens
Stared down in the valley at a Christmas memory
Saw a young boy in a cabin hang a stockin' on a peg
Peace on Earth was ours down in the valley

Christmas dinner's cookin', the turkey's golden brown
There's a big old fire a-blazin', all the family's gathered 'round
There was nothin' quite as pretty in the cities or the towns
As my cabin in the valley when the snow is on the ground

Mama still plays carols on those worn out ivory keys
And Papa's hooked his old team up to fetch the Christmas tree
I watch my boy climb on a limb, shakin' loose the mistletoe
Just the way I did not so long ago

Christmas dinner's cookin', the turkey's golden brown
There's a big old fire a-blazin', all the family's gathered 'round
Well, there's nothin' quite as pretty in the cities or the towns
As my cabin in the valley when the snow is on the ground

Christmas dinner's cookin', the turkey's golden brown
There's a big old fire a-blazin', all the family's gathered 'round
Well, there's nothin' quite as pretty in the cities or the towns
As my cabin in the valley when the snow is on the ground
