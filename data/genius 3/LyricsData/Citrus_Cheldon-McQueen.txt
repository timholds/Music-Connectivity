[Chorus]
Fridays she kills it
Saturdays she kills it
Sundays she kills it
Make me remember
Make me remember
Make me remember
Bonita apple
Give me your citrus
Give me your citrus
Give me your citrus
Make me remember
Make me remember
Bonita apple
Make me remember
Bonita apple
Give me your citrus


[Verse 1]
Hello nice to meet you
My names chelly
Guess I forgot the rest
This usually doesn't happen
I'm usually much relaxed and
Very calm and collected
But shit this first impression
Has got me second guessing
Maybe it's just my timing
I should've tucked my tie in
I should've fixed my shirt
I should've wore some diamonds, you look like you like a baller
I mean I used to hoop
I mean I used to ball
I mean I usually do
I'm just your average
Used to cut classes
Drive it til it crashes
Lower class bastard but I
I got these singles
And I'm feeling like I'm diddy
We could spend a night on the city
Or just spend the night
Or just dim the lights
Orchestra in my mind
Playing timpanis
They get louder everytime you sit with me, as the tempo speeds up
Another song ends
I throw the money up high and she keeps dancing â€˜til it lands

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Hello nice to meet you
Oh you wanna know my name?
And not my stripper name
Oh you a rapping nigga all y'all niggas tip the same
And all y'all say y'all different
But all y'all look the same
Ain't nothing change
Wearing gold chains and brand names seem real appealing
But honestly, every rapper seem realer on twitter
Well honestly, every stripper seem bent over scrilla
And probably had daddy issues what's your story?
She got to telling me how
She fell in love once
Then had a baby named her june, she's a cancer
And her father such deadbeat he won't even buy her pampers
Said soon as she graduated she started dancing
Cause she got kicked out
And her baby's father he just dipped out
But it's all in gods plans
Don't you worry bout a thing
You just throw that money up high i'll keep dancing 'til it lands like

[Chorus 2x]
