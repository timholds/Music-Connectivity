[Verse 1]
To change the world
Start with one step
And however small
First step is hardest of all
Once you get your gait
You'll be walking tall
You said you never did
Because you might die trying

[Chorus]
Because you might die trying
Because you

[Verse 2]
If you close your eyes
Because the house is on fire
And think you couldn't move
Until the fire dies
The things you never did
Because you might die trying

[Chorus]
Because you might die trying
You'd be as good as dead
Because you might die trying
Because you might die

[Bridge]
If you give, you begin to live[x2]
You begin
You get the world
If you give, you begin to live
You get the world[x2]
If you give, you begin to live
You might die trying

[Chorus]
