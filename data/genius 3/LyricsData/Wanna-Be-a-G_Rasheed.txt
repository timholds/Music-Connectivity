[Intro]
What's up gangsta?
What's up maan?
I've been lookin' for you maan

[Chorus]

So you wanna be a G?
I wanna be a G
So you wanna be a G?
I wanna be a G
So you wanna be a G ?
I wanna be a G
I wanna be like you
He wanna be like me

[Verse 1}
I wanna be like you Sheed getting' respect on the block
Packin' a teq and a Glock
Fat pockets you got your game on lock
But yet I still see you bowin' your head
Askin' for forgiveness under the street light
Yeah right Shorty
My life style still wrong
It ain't easy standin' strong
Won't be long 'till I'm gone
Every cop in the city got me in they picture frame
Plus different gangs with bullets that got my name
So what then if they come I got something for them
I got your back
We can go to war right now with 'em
And I'll floor 'em
Pour them bloodclots
Dead soldiers for O.G
If these bullets come flyin'
I'm in front of you dyin'
You got heart huh?
What's this on your chest?
You for real ain't you Shorty
Where you get this bulletproof vest?
You a mess but I like you a lot
Let's split them from this spot
Them bullets is hot when the enemy came for the shot

[Chorus repeat 2x]

Say Shorty you ever fell a bullet up in your chest?
Or seen what a hallowpoint bullet can do
It's a damn mess
It's messed up when you have to resort to violence
That's why real bad boys gotta move in silence
Comprenda I understand you tellin' me avoid any trouble whenever I can
That a make me a better man
Be quick to listen and slow to speak
Watch everything and my game will be at peak
And don't trust a freak
You catch on fast you got the heart of a G
And as much as I hate to tell you
You kind of reminder of me
Look out Shorty
What one time commin' up the block
I can't let them see my face
Put away the rocks and the Glocks
Say no more
"What's the problem officer?"
"Now none of ya move come here sir let me talk to ya"
Yeah right
Say Shorty I gotta break
I ain't stayin' here either
Well yo lets shake this crooked jake

[Chorus repeat 2x]

[Verse 3]

Damn O.G. you sure run fast for your age
That came from doin' push ups and workin' out when I was in the cage
Say Shorty let's chill for a while
I got a little something in my pockets that will make you smile
I hope it's hydro
If not I got some formaldehyde
What  Shorty?
They put it in people after they died
I'm already fried still pass me that dro
And let me taste this stuff and see what you be trippin' fo'
Smooth with great taste
Shhhh say O.G. you here some bass
Damn that's them busters from the otherside
Watch out Shorty
They pullin' gats out they ride
BOOM BOOM oh man I think I'm hit
Me too Shorty
Better get out of here quick
I can't everything is goin' black O.G
I think I'm dyin too Shorty you wanted to be like me?

[Chorus repeat 2x]
