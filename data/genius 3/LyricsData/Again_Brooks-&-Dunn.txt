[Verse 1]
Ain't it funny the turns life puts you through
Don't know what's 'round the bend, man, you don't know where it's leadin' you
Close your eyes, say a prayer, take it on the chin
It's a dawn sun, comes back again

[Chorus]
Baby, I thought that love was over and gone forever
Never gonna come back to me, never gonna hold me again
But your love pounds in my heart like thunder
Flashes through me like lightnin', makin' me believe again

[Verse 2]
Don't know what I'm supposed to say
Ain't got a clue 'bout what I need to do
All I know is I feel right here
Right now, here with you

[Chorus]
Baby, I thought that love was over and gone forever
Never gonna come back to me, never gonna hold me again
But your love pounds in my heart like thunder
Flashes through me like lightnin', makin' me believe...

[Chorus]
Baby, I thought that love was over and gone forever
Never gonna come back to me, never gonna hold me again
But your love pounds in my heart like thunder
Flashes through me like lightnin', makin' me believe again

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Makin' me believe again
