[Hook: Sincere]
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London Town
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' UK now
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' UK now

[Verse 1: D Double E]
I represent East London Dungeon
Ends is full of cats and drunkens
Niggas dem are hungry, bellies shrunken
So we gotta shot white and punk and
But this music shit coming from London
Right about now is bigger than London
Call my name anywhere in England
Somebody's gonna know my slogan
I made it myself, nobody made me
Everybody on the road, they rate me
D Double E, I get booked daily
Too many haters wanna bait me
Just because they can't make no Ps
They wanna bring a man down just like gravity
When you get booked, nah, you can't have a P
So what you spitting for, rudeboy? Charity?

[Hook: Sincere]
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London Town
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' UK now
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' UK now

[Verse 2: Scorcher]
Look, I represent North London Dungeon
Little niggas on the roads with big guns
I'm from Tottenham over to Junction
Feds chase youngers with truncheons
Catch niggas slipping and we might munch them
For all of their bits
And we come round your ends and take all of your chicks
Hip hop, grime, I make the hits
The whole game's mine, cool for a sec
I'm here for the mills, hand over a cheque
I'm on your TVs, radios and your whips
Wiley, Dirtee Stank is a wrap
Jump out your box and you will get clapped
Like a round of applause
Licking all the shots and the brown for the scores
Two of the Qs, half of Bs
Haul 'em away, up to the doors

[Hook: Sincere]
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London Town
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' UK now
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' UK now

[Verse 3: Scorcher]
Ayy look, darg, I represent LDN in the big UK
The place where me and Sincere move yay
The home of Big Ben, where youts get a hold of big skengs
And then roll over, big men
And when stars come here with their chains on
They get back on a plane but the chain's gone
It's truly this gritty, don't confuse the big city
What'd you think, we're all queen and country?
Darg, it's more like flick knives, ballies, ninas, pumpys
Boxes, clingfilm, needles, junkies
We're all tryna lick a million shots in the city of God
To stack the sterling
Feds wanna raid on the flats we serve in
But we don't wait, we just relocate
OT cuh we're that determined

[Hook: Sincere]
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London Town
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' UK now
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' London, London
We're reppin' UK now
