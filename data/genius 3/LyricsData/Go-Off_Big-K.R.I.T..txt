[Hook:]
I got a party pack of pills and a quarter ounce of soul
I feel nigga walk man, I feelin' nigga woke
I feel nigga walk man, I feelin' nigga woke
Got the VIP piece section in that bitch block (?)
I feel nigga walk man, I feelin' nigga woke
Ho hollin' have my money these niggas be talk
I feel nigga walk man, I feelin' nigga woke
Poppin' bottle after bottle, smokin' log after log
I feel nigga walk man, I feelin' nigga woke

[Big KRIT:]
Hey my partner pop a whip and I'm a drink until I throw up
And bottle poppin', pimpin' I'mma about to drink until (?)
And bottle poppin', pimpin' I'mma drink until I throw up
And roll up partner sticky icky and smoke it till I blow up
And know what? The baddest bitch in the club I could sew up
Niggas losin' their hoes, hey shawdy chose soon as I showed up
Hey pimp tight, (?) break a bitch quick
Grab me back my cab, (?) that ass a steel key
Hol' up blow up, all day stuntin'
What you expect, a young nigga got money
I'mma go on, show off, everday I'm breathin'
Don't be pointin' out the haters I don't even see 'em
Young Krizzle ain't never run out of bread, yea we eatin'
I stunt for the fuck of it, I don't need a reason
