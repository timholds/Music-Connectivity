It's close to sundown, and something green is spawning in the dark
Under the torchlight, you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to run, but hunger takes the speed before you make it
You start to freeze he's looking you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed

'Cause it's a creeper, creeper fight
And I can try to save you from the blast about to strike
You know it's a creeper, creeper fight
I'm fighting for your life against a creeper, creeper fight

You hear the hissing and realize you're about to be done
You feel the ground shake those monsters know exactly where to run
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while, you see the blocks come flying straight from behind
You're almost out of life

Cause it's a creeper, creeper fight
There ain't no second chance after he blasts you sky high, girl
Creeper, creeper fight
I'm fighting for your life, against a reaper, creeper, fight

Green creepers calling, your left to die with only your spade
Theres no escaping the blow of the creeper this time
This is the end of your life

They're coming to get you, these creatures close in faster than you can hide
They will catch you unless you can outrun them by a mile
Now is the time for you and I to grab the sword together, yeah
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see

That it's a creeper, creeper fight
Cause I'll protect you more than any wolf could ever dare try
Creeper, creeper fight
So let me grab my sword and kill a
Reaper, creeper, reaper, creeper, and fight

Cause it's a creeper, creeper fight
Girl, I'll protect you more than any wolf could ever dare try
Creeper, creeper fight
So let me grab my sword and kill a
Reaper, creeper-

Nightfall crawls across the land
Keep your swords close at hand
Creepers walk in search of blood
To end your minecraft life for good

And anyone that will be found
Without a sword to take them down
Must stand and face the creeper of hell
And blown up like a bomb shell

All around you be aware
Of the monsters that fill your darkest fears
And when they're tempered you'll be doomed
But if you slay them, sulfur will be consumed

And though you fight to stay alive
His death list grows steeper
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the Creeper

Muahahaaaahahaaahahaaaaa
