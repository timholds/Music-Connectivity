If I had
If I had more
More would be laid at your feet

If you give me
Just a little smile
The dogs on my trail wouldn't drag me back to jail

I woke up in a horse's stomach one foggy morning
His eyes were crazy and he smashed into the cemetery gates

All I want is to be a happy man
All I want is to be a happy man

I've seen teeth
Across the horizon
Fangs spanning yellow against the earth

There ain't nothing, yeah but ghosts

Fever, rabbit dreams and drunken boats

I woke up in a horse's stomach one foggy morning
His eyes were crazy and he smashed into the cemetery gates

All I want is to be a happy man
All I want is to be a happy man

I woke up in a horse's stomach one foggy morning
His eyes were crazy and he smashed into the cemetery gates

All I want is to be a happy man
All I want is to be a happy man
All I want is to be a happy man
All I want is to be a happy man
All I want
All I want
All I want
All I want
