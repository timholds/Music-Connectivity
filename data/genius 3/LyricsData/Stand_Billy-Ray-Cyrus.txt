[Verse 1]
The story of a heart in need
Playing on my TV Screen
Will I sit back and watch it fade
There's gotta be a better way

[Verse 2]
Love is more than what you feel
Love is action, love is real
Break your silence, turn the key
And be the change you wanna see

So get ready, come on everybody
Are you ready to

[Pre-Chorus]
Stand for what you believe in
Stand for all that is right
Stand, its stuck all around you
You can be that shining light

[Chorus]
Stand when troubles come calling
You're gonna be alright
Stand, just reach deep inside you
And be that shining light, stand

[Verse 3]
I feel the air shake, raise my voice
I have my soul, I have a choice
I feel it burning, I want more
So what am I waiting for?

So get ready, come on everybody
Are you ready to

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Break]
Oh, stand

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
