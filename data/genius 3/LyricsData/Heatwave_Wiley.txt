[Verse 1: Wiley]
If I draw five for the day
Then we ain't got to worry, we're nice for the day
Inspired by the sun, take flight for the day
Sipping a cold beer, sunshine in your face
Long nights are crazy we are on them
My name's Wiley, yeah play my song then
When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave
I got vibes to sell, people want them

[Hook: Ms. D](x2)
I'mma party, I'm gon' dance, put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body
I'mma party, I'm gon' dance, put your hands up on my body
On my body, on my body, put your hands up on my body

[Verse 2: Wiley]
When the sun's out see the gyaldem too
I wake up do another gyaldem tune
I ride out on my Yamaha R6
When I reach in the dance, bring the gyaldem through
Gyaldem know so they wanna wind up
I get behind her and she get wile up
She back it up good but I try my luck
Wining up gyal is the vibe I love

[Bridge: Wiley]
When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave
I've got vibes to sell people want them
My name's Wiley yeah play my song then
When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave
Causing a heatwave, causing a heatwave, causing a heatwave
When I arrive I'm causing a heatwave

[Verse 3: Wiley]
When the sun's out we just wanna impress
I stand in the clear I don't bother with mess
If it ain't gonna sell I don't wanna invest
If it ain't got a vibe I ain't got a interest
I wanna see a ice cream van on the road
I wanna see a light skin gyal on the road
I wanna get a slush puppy with both flavours
Drink that now I'm right back in my zone

When the sun's out see the gyaldem too
I wake up do another gyaldem tune
I ride out on my Yamaha R6
When I reach in the dance, bring the gyaldem through
Gyaldem know so they wanna wind up

She back it up good but I try my luck
Wining up gyal is the vibe I love
When the sun's out we just wanna impress
I stand in the clear I don't bother with mess
If it ain't gonna sell I don't wanna invest
If it ain't got a vibe I ain't got a interest
I wanna see a ice-cream van on the road
I wanna see a light skin gyal on the road
I wanna get a slush puppy with both flavours
Drink that now I'm right back in my zone
