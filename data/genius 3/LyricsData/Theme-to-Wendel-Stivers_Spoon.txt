[Verse]
When I do count the clock that tells the time
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night
When I behold the violet past prime
And sable curls all silvered o'er with white
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard
Then of thy beauty do I question make
That though among the wastes of time must go
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
And die as fast as they see others grow
And nothing against time's scythe can make defense
Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence
Primary
(all right now!)
The primary means of motivation
Walks onto her place on thirteenth street
The primary means of motivation
Paints a picture on her lover's face
