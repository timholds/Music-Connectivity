[Hook]
When I jump in my tinted '05 and switch on the air-con
It's a cold vibe, cold drive
I'm living the cold life, and it's T
Everyting bless
[x2]

[Verse 1]
When I jump in my tinted '05, all of a sudden
My business is not only mine. Time after time
People ask me how do they get mine. Jealousy: that's why
I spit some deep bars; probably for one more time
I'm not gonna lie: I've got money in the bank, I'm here on the grind
If I want a tracksuit, I'll jump in my tinted '05
Drive to the local cash-point, put my card in
Draw a couple of hundred pound, and it's T

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
[?], a tinted OS is [?]
With a chrome frame and a private number plate
And a navigation [?] so I can turn up outside the state
I'm still gonna be on Tenerife when I'm making my serious papes
And I'm making papes, but the thing is I'm not moving weight
That's why guys are [?] cause moving to me is too bate
Move to me, go on then, and I'll have you back by the next day
Where you'll be stuck in a cell and I'll be driving away

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm a top geez'. Imagine what I'll be like in five years
I know I'll have less Ps, less fees, more money and a sick career
Plus a [?]
It's only patience now till I reach there
One day I'll get there; get to the place I want to be
I'm not on the bum time, not on the hundred-pound crime
Stay focussed till I get mine; my time will come
If I stay focussed. And it's T

[Hook x2]
