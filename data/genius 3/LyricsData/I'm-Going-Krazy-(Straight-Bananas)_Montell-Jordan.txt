Verse I
Baby baby baby let me talk to you
(Bee) im digging your attitude
I got a real bad habit
Maybe all the things you do to me
Is causing my insanity
If this is this my reality
Lock me up and throw away the key

Chorus
I'm going crazy
Can't get you out my mind
I'm going crazy
Thinking about you all the time
I'm going crazy
Straight bananas over you
Baby, you got me going crazy

Verse II
Tell me how I let you girl
Get me all like this
Then I take one look at you
How can I resist
Trying to understand your crazy ways
Especially when you start to act
Sometimes I wanna fall back
You mean much more than that

Pre chorus
Ohh it's your buddy
Got me nutty
All into you
Can I just kick it
I'm addicted
Don't turn me loose
