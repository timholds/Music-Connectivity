[Verse 1]
King Pin on a cutback
King Pin on a cutback
With sunken eyes

Big cheese in a bedsit
Big cheese in a bedsit
A shit disguise

[Pre-Chorus]
Stick and move, said you want to try me
You should've left it just where you found it
I see you dreaming, thinking what it could be
You'll have to trust me, just don't believe me

[Chorus]
Reap what you sow
Comeback Kid
Says hello

Here, here we stand
Side by side
Don't let go (of my hand)

[Verse 2]
Sasquatch in a bin bag
Sasquatch in a bin bag
It's no suprise

Nosebleed in a pound shop
Nosebleed in a pound shop
Spitting flies

[Pre-Chorus]
Stick and move, said you want to try me
You should've left me just where you found me
Say goodnight, I'm 'bout to hypnotise you
Here it comes I just thought I'd warn you

[Chorus]
Reap what you sow
Comeback Kid
Says hello

Here, here we stand
Side by side
Don't let go (of my hand)

[Bridge]
Back when you know you shoulda sent to do it on a mission
You were the only one who said you'd stay if you could have it
I guess you want it, guess you want it, guess you want it
I guess you want it, guess you want it, guess you want it
I still don't know if you do want it, do you want it, do you?
Do you want it, do you want it, do you want it, do you?

[Chorus]
Reap what you sow
Comeback Kid
Says hello

And here, here we stand
Side by side
Don't let go

Reap what you sow
Comeback Kid
Says hello

And here, here we stand
Side by side
Don't let go
