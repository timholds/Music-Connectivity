(Flava)
I just want you to listen
Troubled minds of the troubled times, keep yourself together, don't listen to other peeps
Cause a lot can happen on the streets, and peer pressure is a killer so listen to there wide
Words that i preach, it ain't safe out there, i know this from experience, coz this is serious
And that's how lives get messed up, i took this time to, just eight bars to explain to the kids
Whats up

(Kenzie)
You're livin in dangerous minds, dangerous times, thug life, you're growing up on the street
All that crime, i've been there before, i've been through it, i realise the pain, im drawn into
It, it feels terrible, when you're on another level, to the rest of them, trainers, clothes
You're not in with the trend, it's just a teenage beef thats bothering you, its just a phase in
Life you'll have to go through

(Chorus)
You know i never will amount to you, but is it pain you gotta put me through, you know i never
Will live up to you, and all that you do, you never tell your enemies from friends, and life
Will never be the same again, you never know where the story ends, thats right my friend, thats
Where the story ends

(Krazy)
I hear these things again and again and again, dress to impress for a friend, all it does
Everytime i hear will it ever stop, it just sends me round the bend, it ain't easy to be a
Teenager, i should know it puts your life in danger, do you ever really think that it will stop
All the muggings and the bullys and wepons i think not

(Freek)
I can sit and write lyrics all day, but my teenage problems never fade away, my fasion sence
Never lead astray, my smell, my phone is what portrays, the person that i am, the person that is
Me, whatever you believe, imagine or percieve, a brethren or a chief, educated or naive, my
Popularity brings, friends and enemies

(Repeat Chorus)
(Rocky B)
Teenage life you've gotta deal with it somehow, no point in complaining gotta live with it
Somehow, unfair job but you're still with it somehoe, it ain't fair but you've gotta get through
It somehow, all the teenagers that have had enough, that are tired of scuffs and just want love
Just take some time unleash your mind and you will find it somehow

(Spike-e)
What's wrong kid could be making it, teenager in trouble and you're hatin it, you wanna leave
The crowd your with, lead your own life, but i know you're scared of it, in a week there's 7
Days 168 hours and a million ways, everyday's different but your life will change, trust me it
Will never stay the same again

(Repeat Chorus)
(Melo-D)
Growing up seems so hard when you're young, you never wanna listen always wanna have fun, try
To make things right but it soons wrong, people say the best years come when you're young, you
Never listen to what people say, always wanna try and do things n your own way, never think
Straight always play life as a game and in the end it's another life thrown away

(Reepa)
Teenage troubles thoughts that run through your head, trying to impress cause of what your
Mates said, wanna get in the crowd you ain't got the clothes so you're out for a teenager thats
What lifes about, the pressure of the drugs violence and racism that faces them its a partof
Life dont ruin it for yourself or you might end up by yourself

(Strider)
You think about back in the day, of what you could have had but you threw it away, to be the
Top boy on the street, to be the boy everybody wanted to be, can't you see

(Repeat Chorus to Fade)
