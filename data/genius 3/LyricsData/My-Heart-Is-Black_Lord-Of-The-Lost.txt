[Intro]
My heart is black!

[Strophe 1]
The first one
I killed was by mistake
The second
Infected by the snake
Delusion
Set in after the third
I'm losing the track

[Chorus]
My heart is black
My blood is cold, my skin is pale
My heart is black
Now follow me on my black trail
My heart is black
My eyes are wide, my hands are nailed
My heart is black
I'm leaving now
The plan has failed
Follow me I know the way

[Strophe 2]
I'm only
A shadow of myself
I'm lonely
What have I become
I'm falling
Back down the steps I climbed
I'm going back

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If you don't want to fight with me
Leave silently
But never turn your back on me
My heart is black

Follow me I know the way

[Chorus]
