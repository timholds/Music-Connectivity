[Verse 1]

Here's the introduction, yes my man, he's on production
The veterans bringing that medicine like Robitussin
Snakes tremble and resemble earthquakes
Go against the crates, your body catch the shakes
Your mailman ain't got what I'm delivering
I said Robin don't know about the hood that I'm living in
Giving in? Never ever
I go all out when I climb, the bottom line is I'm terror
You'll get scarred, cause I'm coming hard with the rhythm
Couldn't maintain, need help, say "God won't you give in?"
We drop facts, over raw tracks that's starring me
And Show, they don't know, they sounding for R&B
The loot'll come later if we stay true now
But some can't stay true cause they don't know how
Peep it, you'll be gone before we wrong
Show & A representing Uptown, check your math, that's Pelan
You'll get peed on cause we already shitted
Here's the cure for hip-hop, the medicine, now come and get it

[Hook]

It's the medicine, this is how we swing it
Suckers want noise, I advise them to bring it (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 2]

The second chapter will capture
All through verse two, I'm a burst through like I clapped ya
Forget the fame cause my aim is dinero
Got the heart for this art with the smarts like Shapiro
A pharoah, here's the medicine, see the arrow
Pointing at the fellas, the Neighbors and the Ghetto Dwellas
From New York to Missouri
My glory is handshakes and hugs, it shows that your rooting for me
Attack like Cujo, fat like a sumo
Pulling mommies like Menudo cause I'm numero uno
Getting paid out my culo
So if you didn't know before, now you do know

[Hook]

It's the medicine, this is how we swing it
Suckers want noise, I advise them to bring it (Repeat 4x)

[Verse 3]

Now I'm building with my man, stranded on the rocks
I'm telling lies to my vision, peeping out the box
And near the top with some niggas with no skills
If your videos ain't have them hoes would you still get them record sales?
You can fool the majority
But the minority keeps it raw like all y'all in poverty
It's hard to be the man, they trying to tie down both hands
I gotta use my brain, maintain and expand
Some don't like what I do, I say fuck it, they're critics, too
Don't contemplate with them, I just concentrate on you

[Hook]

It's the medicine, this is how we swing it
Suckers want noise, I advise them to bring it (Repeat 4x)
