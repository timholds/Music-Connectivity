There goes Moses carrying his Bible Book
Never has a problem, just has a cup
It's good clean alcohol and it fills you up
And here I go laughing like a fool, yeah
Things ain't working out down at the farm
Got no bag or baggage or no love to keep me warm
And I ain't been in trouble since the day I was born
Things ain't working out down at the farm
I used to spend my sunny summer days supping aways
Along came [Incomprehensible] and he put me aways
Down at the station that was kept for strays
And I went laughing, geez, he like busting me, he like busting me
Things ain't working out down at the farm
Got no bag or baggage or no love to keep me warm
And I ain't been in trouble since the day I was born
Things ain't working out down at the farm
Things ain't working out down at the farm
Got no bag or baggage or no love to keep me warm
And I ain't been in trouble with the Lord before
Things ain't working out down at the farm
He caught me unawares and he made me strip naked
Ooh, I was scared, ooh, I was scared, I was shaking
And he said, it's you and me and me and you
And you and me and me and you and you and me and me and you
And you and me and me and you and you and me
And I just kept laughing like a fool, yes
Things ain't working out down at the farm
Got no bag or baggage or no l-l-love to keep me warm
And I ain't been in trouble since the day I was born
Oh yeah
Things ain't working out down at the farm
