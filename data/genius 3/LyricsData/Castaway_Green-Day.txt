[Verse 1]
I'm on a sentimental journey into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the war that's in my mind
I'm leaving in a lurch and I’m taking back what's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
Onto Desolation Road
Where I'm a....

[Chorus]
Castaway
Going at it alone
Castaway
Now I'm on my own
Lost and found
Trouble bound
Castaway

[Verse 2]
I'm riding on the night train, and driving stolen cars
Testing my nerves out on the boulevard
Spontaneous combustion on the corners of my mind
I'm leaving in a lurch, and I'm taking back what's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
Onto Desolation Road
Where I'm a....

[Chorus]
Castaway
Going at it alone
Castaway
Now I'm on my own
Lost and found
Trouble bound
Castaway

[Verse 1]
I'm on a sentimental journey into sight and sound
Of no return and no looking back or down
A conscientious objector to the war that's in my mind
I'm leaving in a lurch and I’m taking back what's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on a mission
Into destination unknown
An expedition
Onto Desolation Road
Where I'm a....

[Chorus]
Castaway
Going at it alone
Castaway
Now I'm on my own
Lost and found
Trouble bound
Castaway
