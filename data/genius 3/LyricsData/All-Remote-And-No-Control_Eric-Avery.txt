[Verse 1]
Every man and every woman
Stood stock still
And turned to you
And everything looks too familiar
Well that means
That you’ve been still

[Chorus]
When I can see it I can see it (all that comes must go)
When I can’t see it I can’t see it (all remote and no control)
When I can feel it I can feel it (the whole world loves a cage)
When I can’t feel it I can’t feel it (all remote and no control)

[Verse 2]
Sun seems frozen low in the winter sky
Metallic day both cold and dry
On every path at every station I see you all now and the wax keeps melting
And I know that I can’t stop and explain

[Chorus]
When I can see it I can see it (all that comes must go)
When I can’t see it I can’t see it (all remote and no control)
When I can feel it I can feel it (the whole world loves a cage)
When I can’t feel it I can’t feel it (all remote and no control)

[Bridge]
And I can only imagine when I’d see this time this street again
The moments that tick by won’t tick back by
And I can only imagine when I’d see this time this street again
The moments that tick by won’t tick back by
