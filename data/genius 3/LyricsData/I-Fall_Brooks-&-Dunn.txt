[Verse 1]
I breeze through the day
An' nothin' much seems, to get in my way
I don't have a care, at all
You walk in the room
It's always the same, you call out my name
I turn, you smile, an' I fall

[Verse 2]
I'm at home at night
Just me an' the moon, we're doin' all right
When out of the blue, you call
I hang up the phone
I lay down in bed, you're still in my head
I dream, you smile, an' I fall

[Bridge]
Oh, what could this feelin' be
Could it really be love, and it's happening to me?
Oh yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
The closer you get
The harder it is to keep it together
I don't have a chance, at all
It's out of my hands
Oh, but what can I do, I'm crazy for you
We touch, you smile, an' I fall

[Outro]
Oh, yeah
We touch, you smile, an' I fall
