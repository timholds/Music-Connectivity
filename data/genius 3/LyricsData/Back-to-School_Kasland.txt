[Hook]
Everybody get wild, now act a fool
All the pizza boxes piled, so masterful
Noise complaints being filed, a disaster whoo
Just act like a child, we're going back to school

[Verse 1]
Back when I first started people thought I was retarded
Banging beats up in my bedroom in a tiny ass apartment
I was bullied by my peers like the fat kid when he farted
Just another open minded grinding artist who is starving
Til I opened up my shell now I'm the life of the party
I'm a ladies man (eww, go away) alright then I'm sorry
Poor me another me drink with some Sprite and Bacardi
Then I look around the room like we're not hyped enough are we
It's time we get music bumping, cruising jumping, losing something
Clueless humping everybody's wasted now we're bruised and slumping
Come the next morning, then we get right back
To the party with some kegs and connect like that
Everybody get your drinks and then we shout, so
Loud that people know it's going down, go
To the biggest party happening in town, no
Body can amount to this sound, oh

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Pool party in the back let's get active y'all
If you lose your pants swimming then just laugh it off
Drinks and pizza on me well for half the cost
Drinking so much booze I think we're blasting off
Chug, chug, chug, chug
Drink all you can until you... ugh

"Woah woah woah, man. Stop the music, man. Stop the music"
"Shit. You alright, man?" "False alarm!"

Coming up with something stupid getting naked running nude and
Screaming like an animal while everybody else is rooting
Race around the campus and just hope you don't get caught
Better hope you're keeping up your pride is broken if you're not
Now let's have a blast, live it up, make it last
If you don't know how to party this is college, take a class
Don't regret not having fun in case you choose to take a pass
Getting wild and out of hand until I finally break my ass

[Hook]
