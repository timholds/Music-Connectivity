[Verse 1: T.I.]
Automatic bullet flow
Uzi, Calico
Ladies man, Yeah, but to that pussy I'm a bully tho
Beat it, eat it, let it go
Retarded, stupid, silly tho
This city been on life support
I'm gonna get out and kill it tho
Really tho, off the chain
Getting it, doing heavy things
Stuntin out the frame
Still to bust a nigga cabin mayne
God like Charlamagne
In the A the hottest thing
Ever hit it, ever did it, most these niggas garbage mayne
I ain't finna front, nigga lame if you ask me
I'm way in the front, run shit, no athlete
Passionly, nigga watch my smoke as I go and get money to the top I go
Tell you get dough, nigga stop I know the housekeeper get more
Now come and mop my floor

[Hook]
Sittin' up high, small money we don't see no
Stupid, dumb fly ask yo bitch, nigga she know
Nigga know my stylo, swagg on G O
Shittin on yo pride nigga pissin'on yo ego
We be pissin' on yo ego, pissin' on yo ego
We shittin' on yo pride nigga pissin'on yo ego
We be pissin'on yo ego, pissin'on yo ego
Sucka hate it, we know but we pissin'on yo ego

[Verse 2: B.o.B.]
I'm back up on my rap shit, you bastards got it backwards
Got it twisted and exaggerated
Stretched out: elastics
You niggas ain't on my radar!
I bypass niggas, no gastric
I pull up front in that monster truck
And I park that shit Jurrassic
Got a drunk bitch on my mattress
Doing backflips, gymnastics
She holding on to that monkey bar
Yelling out my name: no ad-libs
Niggas get mad at us for what?
We live out life at the after-party
Don't come at me with that ego shit
I piss on that like a port-o-potty
This beat is retarded so therefore my flow is autistic
Come on down to Bobby's World
You and your friend oughta visit
Flow like I'm on a mission
So there is no competition
It's looking like hunting season
And we in the slaughter business

[Hook]

[Verse 3: T.I.]
Ball hard: pavement
Broads in amazement
Large money talking, I ain't gotta make a statement
My impatient grind, I'm taking mine
I ain't finna wait for mine
Anybody wanna shine, I suggest you wait in line
I'm chasing dime paper
But for these haters I don't break a stride
Defecating on your pride, make you commit suicide
Do or die, who am I?
Bullet hit the Bulls-eye
I'm doin' my thing, Say I ain't my nigga you a lie
Do it by the hood, I grew up to say what's up
And all the real niggas know me, I don't need no introduction
Bulletproof truck with a couple cute sluts in the back
Doin everything I ask for a wrap whats that
They handle that and I stroke that cat so good I get my money back

[Hook]
