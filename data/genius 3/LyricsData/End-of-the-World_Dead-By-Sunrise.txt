When you read the news
Does it make you sick?
Murder, money, politics
Gonna fill you up
Get your bullshit fix
It's the end of the world
Grab your crucifix
And fall to your knees
And beg God please
Have mercy on me (Mercy!)

When you turn on the TV
What do you get?
Sex, lies, scandal, violence
Like the end of a gun
Pressed against your lips
It's the end of the world
Grab your crucifix
And fall to your knees
And beg God please
Have mercy on me

When you can't buy gas
And you can't pay rent
And what you've got left
Is the Government's
No win
No future
No benefit
It's the end of the world
Grab your crucifix
And fall to your knees
And beg God please
Have mercy on me

Coming out of the hypocrisy
Coming out of the bureaucracy
Coming in to lead a war
They're a SHAME!

You can ignore what you cannot see
You can believe in a lie
You can run away from anything
Until you open your eyes

No rest for the wicked
Yeah they never quit
Watchin', waiting
For the next trick
We won't be celebrating
When the atom's split
It's the end of the world
Grab your crucifix
And fall to your knees
And beg god please
Have mercy on me

Coming out of the hypocrisy
Coming out of the bureaucracy
Coming in to lead a war
They're a SHAME!

You can ignore what you cannot see
You can believe in a lie
You can run away from anything
Until you open your eyes

Coming out of the hypocrisy
Coming out of the bureaucracy
Coming in to lead a war
They're a SHAME!
