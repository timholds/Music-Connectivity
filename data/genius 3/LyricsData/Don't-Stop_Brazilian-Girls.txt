[Chorus]
Don't stop, don't stop now
Just keep on goin'
Until I come
Until I come in
Don't stop, don't stop now
Just keep on goin'
Until I come
Until I come in

[Verse 1]
Playing hard to get when we're together
Hard to get there on your own
When will you ever come to conscience
I'll let you be alone
You never had it better
Than when I was with you, baby
'Scomeback to earth
Let's drink some tea and smoke some herb

[Chorus]
Don't stop, don't stop now
Just keep on goin'
Until I come
Until I come in
Don't stop, don't stop now
Just keep on goin'
Until I come
Until I come in

[Verse 2]
Now I know it takes three balls to juggle
Fifty cents of humour's worth
When and how did I become my mother
Am I getting on your nerves?
Lets just not talk about it
And fill the blanks with space
Go to the park later
Get some ice cream

[Chorus]
Don't stop, don't stop now
Just keep on goin'
Until I come
Until I come in
Don't...
Don't
Just keep on goin'
Just keep on goin'

La la la
La la la la la
La la la
La la la la la
La la la
La la la la la
La la la
La la
La la la
La la la la la
La la la
La la la la la
La la la
La la la la la
La la la
La la

[Outro]
Don't stop
Don't stop
Just keep on goin'
Until I come
Until I come in
Stop
