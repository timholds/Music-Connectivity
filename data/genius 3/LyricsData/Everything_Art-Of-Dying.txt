[Verse 1]
Late at night
I wake up from the cold
Another fight yeah
Yeah we broke the mold
You were right
But I needed you to know
All I want is everything

[Verse 2]
I hit the streets
So I can clear my head
Under the heat
Of neon red
I'm three sheets
But I meant every word I said
All I want is everything
All I want is everything

[Chorus]
I won't give up until this feelings over
I've had enough of drinking myself sober
I really want to let you know
Never want to watch you go
All I want is everything
Oh oh oh

[Verse 3]
This love is keeping me alive
When push comes to shove will we survive
Is there enough when you look into my eyes
All I want is everything
All I want is everything

[Chorus]
I won't give up until this feelings over
I've had enough of drinking myself sober
I really want to let you know
I never want to watch you go
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
From you
Oh oh oh

[Verse 4]
The cemetery is the only place tonight
Dark enough to search my soul
Morning comes
Thought I'd never see the sun
But dragonfly you've always been the one
I won't give

[Chorus]
I won't give up until this feelings over
I've had enough of drinking myself sober
I really want to let you know
I never want to watch you go
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
All I want is everything
