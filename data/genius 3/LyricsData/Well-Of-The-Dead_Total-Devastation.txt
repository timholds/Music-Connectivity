Where are you going - does anyone know
Should you go - just go with the flow
I'd rather die you say to yourself
As you fall in the well of the dead

Desperation is a stinky cologne
Sometimes you can smell your own
Follow the word in vain
Lead me to the truth of lies

How you live your life
How you pray to god
Way you kill your mind
Way you slowly die

Desperation is a stinky cologne
Sometimes you can smell your own
Follow the word in vain
Lead me to the truth of lies
