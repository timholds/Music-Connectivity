{Intro - Rocky B}

You Came
It's now or never
It's a new day
When the pressure's on
We'll never fall
That's the way it is
The storm will forever progress
And we shall eternally reign
We are what we are
And believe me, we're no angels

{Spike-e}
Theres a time and a place to place your hate
Two-faced enemies become friends
One too many mistakes made
As young kid whispers
Who cares what they say
So I say I care
So I say you make way
Prepare for the gateway to open
The 10 strong hold the flows golden
You still don't know them
You've missed the best part of the show but what you don't know
Is there's more to come
Forget your troubles hold on

Are you for real
I don't see no wings no halos
I see myself twisted up back when platinum had cane roll
In the beginning
Now or never
Now we're winning
Bring your flows chillin' back
Sittin' here and rippin' tracks
Still black suit white shirts
Still rappin' in booths
Still merc cruise
Still a career
It still works you haters collect
The papers I rake
You mistakers mistakin' my game you just fake

{Chorus}
We're no angels angels angels angels
So don't mistake us any more
We're no angels angels angels angels
If that's what you thought before
We're no angels
We just are what we are
No angels
Well we might have been in the past
We came from nothin' people didn't know bout us
No angels angels angels

{Kenzie}
Yo I grew up not knowing too much
But flowin' were tough and I won't lie
Everybody gotta try sometimes
The eyes of the public will not be disrupted
Coz the rhymes that I come with ain't the concept that you wanted
Yo craft what is positive
Laugh when you're negative
And hatreds a draught blown away that should never live
I'm no angel but this is one tale bout one click with 10 men
That have just gone and made it

{Krazy}
You are who you are but people see different
They only think they see good things but they're trippin'
People do what they wanna do
Think what they wanna think
Watch when their backs an they do wrong as well as when they bling
They wanna see how perfectly their kid could be
Think then they'll be the biggest thing in history
Bein' this wonderful person an angel or somethin'
I'm not sayin' everyones bad or nothin'
I think we're average

{Repeat chorus}

{Rocky B}
Yo
I ain't a angel I ain't a saint I ain't a sinner I'm a winner
This is thug life for beginners bedrin
Pass me the blues let me build a king L
So when my times up I will still be blazin' in hell
And when it comes the bells shall ring
The angels sing the demons creep
The holocaust will reap
The souls of the mortal
So don't run unless you're forced too
The end of days is amongst us Judas hung himself

{Repeat chorus}

We're no angels
I thought you'd never be surprised to see me sitting at your crib
I know you wanna be me
We're no angels angels angels angels
So don't trust me as far as you can throw me

We're no angels
We just are what we are
No angels
Well we might have been in the past
We came from nothing people didn't know bout us
No angels angels angels

{Freek}
You thought you'd never be suprised to see me
Sittin at your crib I know you wanna be me
(no angels angels angels angels)
So dont trust me as far as you can throw me

Repeat chorus & intro to fade
