[Verse 1]
So what of you?
The fateful few
Should take them all
Government fall
So tell your family and friends
We'll keep it plain
Never again

[Chorus]
Well, if you can't walk then run
Well, if you can't walk then run
Walk then run
Well, if you can't walk then...
If you can't walk then run
Well, if you can't walk then run
Walk then run
Well, if you can't walk...

[Verse 2]
I'll make it clear
You'll make it then
But never here
Never again
So which one hangs
Police with gangs?
It's all the same
It's all the same
I met you here
But then you ran
You ran with fear
You fearless man
So tell your violent and tame
That they will cry
Never again

[Bridge]
Ooooooh
Isombard
Isombard
Isombard
Isombard
(You can walk then run)
Isombard
(Well, if you can't walk then run)
(Walk and run)
Isombard
(Well, if you can't walk then...)
(If you can't walk then run)
Isombard
(Well, if you can't walk then run)
(Walk then run)
Isombard
(Well, if you can't walk...)

[Chorus]
Well, if you can't walk and run
Well, if you can't walk then run
Walk then run
Well, if you can't walk then...
If you can't walk then run
Well, if you can't walk then run
Walk then run
Well, if you can't walk...

[Outro - 8x]
Run
If you can't, if you can't, if you can't
