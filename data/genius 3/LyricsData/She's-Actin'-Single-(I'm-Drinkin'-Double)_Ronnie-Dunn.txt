I've seen men look at her before
They think, I don't see
I'd like to think it makes me proud
But I'm only fooling me

I know she'll be lookin' back
The minute I'm not there
While she pours herself on some stranger
I'll pour myself a drink somewhere

She's acting single
I'm drinking double
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles

My heart is breaking
Like tiny bubbles
She's acting single
I'm drinking doubles

I know what she plans to do
But I don't know where or when
If I ask her who that stranger was
She'll just say, "An old friend"

I'm not weak, I tell myself
I stay because I'm strong
The truth is I'm not man enough
To stop her from doing me wrong

She's acting single
I'm drinking doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles

My heart is breaking
Like tiny bubbles
She's acting single
I'm drinking doubles

She's acting single
I'm drinking doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles

My heart is breaking
Like tiny bubbles
She's acting single
I'm drinking doubles

She's acting single
I'm drinking doubles
