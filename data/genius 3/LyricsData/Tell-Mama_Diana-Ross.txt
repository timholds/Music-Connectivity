You thought you had found a good girl
One to love you and give you the world
Now you've found that you've been misused
Talk to me i'll do what you choose

I want you to tell mama all about it
Tell mama what you need
Tell mama what you want
And i'll make everything all right

That girl you had didn't have much sense
She wasn't worth all the time that you spent
She had another man throw you out doors
Now the same man is wearing your clothes

I want you to tell mama all about it
Tell mama what you need
Tell mama what you want
And i'll make everything all right

She would embarass you anywhere
She let everybody know she didn't care
Give me a chance i'm begging you
I just wanna take care of you

Come on and tell mama all about it
Tell mama what you need
Tell mama what you want
Tell mama just what you want right now

Come on and tell mama all about it
Tell mama what you need
Tell mama what you want
Tell mama just what you want right now
