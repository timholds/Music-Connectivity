We are the wanted from yesterday's wreckage
We buy what's wasted and sell it back
Dry heaves are boring, I'm sour, let's watch it
Gutless and tasteless, cut it some slack

There'll be time, yeah, there'll be time
There'll be time, yeah, there'll be time
There'll be time, yeah, there'll be time
Salt future's rising from Salt Lake

Lickin' the salt flat, another bad season
Tripping and soaking, we dry the crop
Here's to the progress of speedy revival
Ten for the harvest, Ten for the slack

There'll be time, yeah, there'll be time
There'll be time, yeah, there'll be time
Salt future's rising
Salt future's rising
Salt future's rising
Salt future's rising
Wet ground floats down in Salt Lake

When the blame is yourself
Save the savers for the hill
Hate the haters, I forget
Make the makers, nothing left
Face the fakers, so obscene
Slave the slavers for the shade
Next time add salt to your fate

There'll be time, yeah, there'll be time
There'll be time, yeah, there'll be time
There'll be time, yeah, there'll be time
Salt future's rising
Salt future's rising
Salt future's rising
Salt future's rising
Wet ground floats down in Salt Lake
