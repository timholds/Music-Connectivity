Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
You've been so good to me
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I'm grateful for my blessings

I'm grateful for my struggles
Trials and tribulations I've been through
I've realized no one can love like You do

Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I feel your presence near
Thank you, Lord, hallelujah
I won't hold back my tears

I gave you my trust
And you took me out of the dark rain
My Lord I survived it
I give You the praise

Lord, You've been so good
You've been so good to me
I'm so grateful for my blessings
Givin You all the praise

Lord, You've been so good
You've been so good to me
I'm grateful for all of my blessings
Giving You all the praise

Jesus loves me, oh yes He does
Jesus loves me, oh yes He does
Jesus loves me, oh yes He does
For the Bible tells me so
So... so, ohhh... so..
(My Jesus loves me, I know)

A-a-a-men, a-a-a-a-men

A-a-a-men, a-a-a-a-men
A-a-a-men, a-a-a-a-men
