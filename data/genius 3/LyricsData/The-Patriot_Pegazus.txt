We'll climb the highest mountains, standing side by side
With immortal armies ready, ready to fight
Feel thy wrath of anger, veangeful body blows
Like a power lord, strike your steely sword

And the skies will darken, lightning fills the air
Smell the fear and torment, the patriot is here
Feel his wrath of anger, veangeful body blows
Like a power lord, strike your steely sword

The battle comes alive, in the heat of the night
Armies and countrymen. With swords and armour strike
Fighting for pride and honour. This war we did not make
Our chosen path is here. Their spirits we will break

We have chosen fate over destiny
See my sword strike, watch them bleed

The battle rages on and on
Till victory is mine
The mighty gods will unveil
Terror from the sky

Climb the mountain top, With the wind in your hair
Plant the flag of truth, our justice is near
The mother of all battles, fight the fight of men
Till the last man standing, there will be no end

We have chosen fate over destiny
See my sword strike, watch them bleed

The battle rages on and on
Till victory is mine
The mighty gods will unveil
Terror from the sky

We have chosen fate over destiny
See my sword strike, watch them bleed

The battle rages on and on
Till victory is mine
The mighty gods will unveil
Terror from the sky
The battle rages on and on
Till victory is mine
