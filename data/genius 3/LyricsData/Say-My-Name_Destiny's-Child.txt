[Hook]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

[Verse 1]
Any other day, I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh" "yeah" "ok"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
I am not the one to sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me, if I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?

[Pre-Hook]
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's going down that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange)
If nobody's holding you back from me
(Cause I know how you usually do)
When you say everything to me times two
(Why can't you just tell the truth?)
If somebody's there then tell me who

[Hook]
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

[Verse 2]
What is up with this?
Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, saying you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago you said you just got in the house
It's hard to believe that you are at home by yourself
When I just heard the voice, heard the voice of someone else
Just this question, why do you feel you gotta lie?
Gettin' caught up in your game, when you cannot say my name

[Pre-Hook]
(I know you say that I am assuming things)
Something's going down that's the way it seems
(Shouldn't be the reason why you're acting strange)
If nobody's holding you back from me

If somebody's there then tell me who

[Hook]
Say my name, say my name

Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Why the sudden change?
Say my name, say my name
When no one is around you
Say baby I love you
If you ain't runnin' game
Say my name, say my name
You actin' kinda shady
Ain't callin' me baby
Better say my name

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, oh

Thou shall know if she can't love you
