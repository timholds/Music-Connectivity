I feel these limbs are growing cold to numb
Take a good look at what I've become
There's a hole in my chest
And I don't think it's leaving room for anyone

There's a burning love for me at rest
Yeah pounding at the walls of my flesh
I'm trying my best
Just to let it set before I come undone

Oh I can't see
The whites are missing from my eyes
I can't breathe
I'm doing everything to bring this body back to life

I'm afraid of shutting down tonight
Yeah I've got this feeling deep inside
No matter how hard I try
I don't think I will make it through the night

Oh I can't see
The whites are missing from my eyes
I can't breathe
I'm doing everything to bring this body back to life

And I'm, afraid of shutting down tonight
I've got this feeling deep inside
No matter how hard I try
I don't think I will make it through the night

And there's a burning love for me at rest
I'm pounding at the walls of my flesh
I'm trying my best
But I can feel this all deep in my chest

Oh I can't see
The whites are missing from my eyes
I can't breathe
I'm doing everything to bring this body back to life

I can't see
The whites are missing from my eyes
I can't breathe
I'm doing everything to bring this body back to life

I can't see
No I can't breathe
I'm doing everything, everything
