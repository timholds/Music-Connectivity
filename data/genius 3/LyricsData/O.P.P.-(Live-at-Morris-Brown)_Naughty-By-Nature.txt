[Intro: Vin Rock]
Here we go, you know what time it is
Morris Brown just jump around in the air
And just jumping like ya just don't care
And just jump around in the air
And just jump **Treach: Army with harmony**
Somebody say O.P.P
Yeah you know me
Say O.P.P
Yeah you know me
**Treach: Yo Kay, drop a load on 'em**
**Vin: A-yo, Treach there's a lot of people out there that wanna know what this O.P.P. shit is about, why don't you take your time and explain it to 'em my brother**

[Verse 1: Treach]
O.P.P., how can I explain it
I'll take it frame by frame it
To have y'all jumping, shouting, saying it
O is for other, P is for peoples', scratch your temple
The last P, well that's not that simple
It's sort of like, well, another way to call a cat a kitten
It's five little letters that are missing here
You get it on occasion if the other party isn't gaming
**Vin Rock: It seems you gotta start to explaining** bust it
You ever had a girl and met her on a nice hello
You get her name and number and then you feeling real mellow
You get home, wait a day she's what you wanna know about
Then you call up and it's her girlfriend or her cousin's house
It's not a front, F to the R to the O to the N to the T
It's just her boyfriend's at her house
Boy, that's what is scary
It's OPP, time other people's what you get it
There's no room for relationship there's just room to hit it
How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at
Who thinks it's wrong cause I'm splitting and cold-hitting that
Well if you do, that's O.P.P. and you're not down with it
But if you don't, here's your membership

[Hook]
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
Who's down with O.P.P., every last homie
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
Who's down with O.P.P., all the homies

[Verse 2: Treach]
Now for the ladies O.P.P. means something gifted
The first two letter's the same but the last is something different
It's the longest, loveliest, lean I call it the leanest
It's another five letter word rhyming with cleanest and meanest
I won't get into that, I'll do it ah sorta properly
I'll say the last P hmmm stands for property
Now lady here comes a kiss, blow a kiss back to me
Now tell me exactly
Have you ever known a brother who had another like a girl or wife
And you just had to stop and just cause he looked just that nice
You looked at him, he looked at you and you knew right away
He had someone but he was gonna be yours anyway
You couldn't be seen with him and honestly you didn't care
Cause in a room behind a door no one but y'all are there
When y'all are finish, y'all can leave and only y'all would know
And then y'all could throw that skeleton bone right in the closet do'
Now don't be shocked cause if you're down I want your hands up high
Say O.P.P., O.P.P., I like to say with pride
Now when you do it, do it well and make sure that it counts
You're now down with a discount

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Treach]
This gal tried to O.P.P. me
I had a girl and she knew that matter-of-fact my girl was partners that
Had a fall out, disagreement, yeah an argument
She tried to do me so we did it in my apartment
Bust it
That wasn't the thing it must have been the way she hit the ceiling
Cause after that she kept on coming back and catching feelings
I said, let's go my girl is coming so you gotta leave
She said, oh no, I love you Treach I said, now child please
You gots to leave, come grab your coat, right now you gotta go
I said, now look you to the stairs and to the stair window
This was a thing, a little thing, you shouldn't have put your heart
Cause you know I was OPP, hell from the very start
Come on, come on, now let me tell you what it's all about
When you get down, you can't go 'round running off at the mouth
That's rule number one in this O.P.P. establishment
You keep your mouth shut and it won't get back to her or him
Exciting isn't it, a special kinda business
Many of you will catch the same sorta O.P.P. is you with
Him or her, for sure is going to admit it
When O.P.P. comes, damn skippy I'm with it

You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
Who’s down with O.P.P., this whole party
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
Who the fucks down with O.P.P., this whole party

[Music pauses, Treach starts talking to the crowd]

You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
Who’s down with O.P.P., this whole party
Everybody just scream
Uh, uh, damn skippy I'm with it
Yo, thanks
And since y'all gave us all that extra shit
We're throwing y'all some extra shit tonight

[Needle scratches as music resumes]

[Vin Rock]
Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump, somebody say hooooo
Say ho, ho

[Treach]
I'm the ghetto-to-ghetto bastard, the human pussy plunger
One log unclogs all the walls of ?
Any sisters, cousins or friends cuz I once said
I'll fuck you from couch ? floor to your bunk bed
Without attire is a choir is a ?
So when you jump they say great balls of fire
Feeling good is just great if you could
Cuz that pussy ain't good as gone when I fuck gone for good
You wanna see the real match as ?
Gimme a stout, Madonna and a weekend
Just like a virgin, she'll be hurtin *drop that slogan*
I'm so bad I fuck her wild as hell while I'm vogue-ing
The many ? sometimes ?
Family ? away when I'm done toots
Up and down, in and out, I work ? bed
When through you shoulda made Holland Tunnel look like a needle head
You still was feeling good after what hit
*You said ? while I'm pushing for lungs and shit
This is the shit that y'all hit cross country
I fuck ya so hard you ? while doing the Humpty
This is the shit ?
I come to your town and cold wreck your set
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me

You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
You down with O.P.P., yeah you know me
Check it out, there's ?
