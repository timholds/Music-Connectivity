Three days was the morning. My focus three days old. My head, it
Landed to the sounds of cricket bows... I am proud man anyway... Covered now
By three days...
Three ways was the morning. Three lovers, in three ways. We knew when
She landed, three days she'd stay. I am a proud man anyway... Covered now by
Three days...
We saw shadows of the morning light the shadows of the evening sun till
The shadows and the light were one. Shadows of the morning light the shadows
Of the evening sun till the shadows and the light were one...
True hunting is over. No herds to follow. Without game, men prey on
Each other. The family weakens by the bite we swallow...
True leaders gone, of land and people. We choose no kin but adopted
Strangers. The family weakens by the length we travel... All of us with
Wings... All of us with wings... All of us with wings! All of us with wings!
All of us with wings! All of us with wings!
Erotic Jesus lays with his Marys. Loves his Marys. Bits of puzzle
Hitting each other. All now with wings! "Oh my Marys! Never wonder... Night
Is shelter for nudity's shiver..." All now with wings...
