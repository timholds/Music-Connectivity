[Chorus]
Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah
I won’t know until tomorrow
Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah
I don't know
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh oh ooh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh
Ooh oh oh ooh

[Verse 1]
I don't know what it is what it is about you
But I can’t seem to take my eyes off you
Got to let you know that I'm meant to you
The later it gets I got to have you
Now that I'm at the end of the bottle
She looks like a supermodel
I think I'm ready to go oh
Give her the keys to my car
I think I fell in love with the bar
Tonight I'm not going ho-o-ome
Ooh

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
12' o'clock back at the club
And I think what happened last night is happening again
12' o'clock back at the club
And I think what happened last night is happening again
Tipsy with a girl who's not my type
But the late it gets it might be on tonight

Now that I'm at the end of the bottle
She looks like a supermodel
I think I'm ready to go oh
Give her the keys to my car
I think I fell in love with the bar
Tonight I'm not going ho-o-ome
Ooh

[Chorus]
Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah
I won’t know until tomorrow
Am I in love or am I faded
Yeah yeah
I don't know
Ooh oh

[Verse 3]
Have I just had too much to drink
Or am I really feeling her
Have you ever been in a situation like this
Or am I the only one?

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Have I just had too much to drink
Or am I really feeling her
Have you ever been in a situation like this
Or am I the only one?
