It is the future... year 6969. Somewhere out in Megaspace
The Pelozees of The Lesbodyke Nebula, in order to continue breeding
After removal from the Universe their last remaining enemy, men
Created the PIL - Penile Impregnation Lingumbot

Rezark SP - a prototype PIL, accidentally launched into chrono-space
During the hyperfiber wars, has programmed a self-replicating evo-loop
And drifts for a kilo-year, alone and sentient in a tele-operative trajectory
Above Planet Three-S: formerly known as Earth

Lowering his astrogate to Planet Three-S, Rezark SP, the last
Surviving Chrononaut, has a bad case of bluballsium
And one thing on his hydro-mind:
Pussy!
