[Intro]
I must be killing them
Wo-o-ow
I must be killing them
Gully

[Chorus]
A mussi true
Mi hotter than bread in the oven
A me pop off the tag pon mi clothes dem
Fuck the enemies, and the foes dem
Fuck the ones dem now, and before dem

[Verse 1]
Right now, mi still a live, mi still a live
Dem nuh waan mi wake up, but mi still a live
Dem waan mi dead, but mi still a live
Who vex, yuh cyaa see me lie inna fridge
If a aids test, mi negative
If a success, mi positive
And mi born pon the Gully, tell you as it is
With alot a con-man, sell you as it is

Me and mi brother Steve use to sleep pon the floor
(Nuff ghetto youth still a sleep pon floor)
Long, long, before me even come tour
(Long, long, before me even come tour)

Mi grand mommy use to take me to church and
And a tell me, fi God mi fi search
Mi enemies nuff, but mi friends dem more
Seh fuck dem

[Chorus]
A mussi true
Mi hotter than bread in the oven
A me pop off the tag pon mi clothes dem
Fuck the enemies, and the foes dem
Fuck the ones dem now, and before dem

[Verse 2]
And mi seh, fuck who a hate mi nuh lose a pound
And if yuh try fi violate, you will lose yuh crown
When the pit bulls out, and the dawgs dem hound
Lord!
Mama son gone down
Man wi' hunt dem, anywhere dem found
A mad rass, mi a king fi the town

When the bomb dem drop, dem think a the drum
(Dem know me)
Real boss pon the track, don't think a the clown
(It coulda never be, dem know)
From me rise pon the top, dem gone pon the ground
(True words, Amen)
Every song shot, suh mi leave dem wound
(See it deh)
Man a lef' the place dutty, so mi lef' dem broom
(Lef' dem broom!)
Broooom
Tj!
If I'm not the greatest, then I'm born to be
Check mi lyrical currency
Dem bwoy deh a counterfeit
But me
(Weh you do?)

[Chorus]
A mussi true
Mi hotter than bread in the oven
A me pop off the tag pon mi clothes dem
Fuck the enemies, and the foes dem
Fuck the ones dem now, and before dem
