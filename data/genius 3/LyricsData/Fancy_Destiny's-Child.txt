I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
You think you're cute, you think you're fine
You're always trying to steal my shine
Get off of me, don't mess with me
You know who you are

I've always been so nice to you, girl
Helping you girl, there for you girl
You always tried to compete with me, girl
Using me girl, abusing me girl
Flirtin' with every man you see
Especially if the man likes me
Baby where's your self esteem
Find your own identity
(Your head ain't right) No congratulating schemer
(Your head ain't right) You's a liar and a cheater
And I don't want you I don't want you I don't want you no more
Don't come knockin' at my door
I don't know what you came here for, if you didn't know then now you know

I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
You think you're cute, you think you're fine
You're always trying to steal my shine
Get off of me, don't mess with me
You know who you are

Roll those eyes girl, twist them hips girl
Swing those hands all in the air
If you wonder why you never had a girlfriend, I think I made myself clear
Girl change your ways right now today
Stop hating me, baby find your own identity
(Your head ain't right) No congratulating schemer
(Your head ain't right) You's a liar and a cheater
And I don't want you I don't want you I don't want you no more
Don't come knockin' at my door
Don't know what you came here for, if you didn't know then now you know

I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
You think you're cute, you think you're fine
You're always trying to steal my shine
Get off of me, don't mess with me
You know who you are

Girlfriend Lord knows that I've tried
No matter how much I give to you, you wanna use me for what I got
You take me kindness for weakness, you take advantage of people
One day you shall reap what you sew, girl get your head up out the clouds

Girlfriend, you think you're cute
Girlfriend, don't ya think you're fine
Girlfriend, you're always trying
Always trying to steal my shine
Girlfriend, you think you're cute [Repeat]

I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
I don't fancy you too much, child
I don't fancy you too much
You think you're cute, you think you're fine
You're always trying to steal my shine
Get off of me, don't mess with me
You know who you are [Repeat 3 times]

I won't say no names
