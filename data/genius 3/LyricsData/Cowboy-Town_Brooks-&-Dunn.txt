[Verse 1]
Dirt, Mud, and Dust
Bibles and Beer
Outlaws, Barb Wire, Saddles, and Steers
Its a simple life, Oh its sacred ground
Hard times, High winds can't bring us down

[Chorus]
In cowboy town, yeah cowboy town
That's were I'm from
Cowboy town

[Verse 2]
We wear our boots to dinner
Drive our trucks to church
Solid as a rock
Salt of the earth
We like our whiskey strong
Play our music loud
Get things done by the sweat of our brow

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Winners, Losers, Sinners and Saints
It's were a good man's word is money in the bank
Bad boys, pretty girls is the name of the game
When you hit the ground, get up, shake off the pain
That's a cowboy town
Someday when I die and my soul is called home
High on a white horse I'll ride up on it
That golden chute will stand old St. Pete
He'll tip his hat and welcome me

[Chorus]
