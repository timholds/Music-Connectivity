(Verse 1)
I saw her wit alesso in miami
Backstage wit tiesto at the grammys
On the Afrojet about a week ago
But she keep tryna tell me that she not a hoe

She got me feelin some way
I think she workin thats what I say  Oh
But I want it in the worst way
Listen to me girl when I say

(Chorus)
Baby I don’t care
If you was a hoe
If you out here fuckin every dj on the road
Baby I don’t care
Give a damn bout what they say
Yeah I know they had it I still want it either way
Baby I don’t care

(Verse 2)
I saw her out in vegas wit aoki
She try and front and act like she ain't know me
Ridin round  wit Carnage in Chicago Damn
Why she have to fuck the homie ohhh

She got me feelin some way
I think she workin thats what I say  Oh
But I want it in the worst way
Listen to me girl when I say

(Chorus)
Baby I don’t care
If you was a hoe
If you out here fuckin every dj on the road
Baby I don’t care
Give a damn bout what they say
Yeah I know they had it I still want it either way
Baby I don’t care
