Tonight you pukes will sleep with your rifles
You're married to this piece, this weapon of iron and wood
And you will be faithful!

This is my rifle
There are many like it but this one is mine
My rifle is my best friend
It is my life
I must master it as I must master my life
Without me my rifle is useless
Without my rifle I am useless

[Verse 1: Shogun Assasson]
Listen to this black visionary, bringin war like a revolutionary
Cause drunk and deadly poetry over murderous melodies
So prepare for death be your penalty
Now you're a mere memory of bloody victory
Soldiers drivin mad by centuries of lies and trickery
Then go on a killin spree puttin devils out their misery
Hearin screams sounds of agony
Hostility takes over me
Mind adventurin through the cracks of insanity
Down the hallowed halls of hell
Walkin the dreaded years with no fears
Givin persons cold stares
Cause I know they fakes as snakes is stabbed in the back
With poisonous attacks whose wicked ass gets subtracted

My rifle and myself are defenders of my country
Me and my rifle are the defenders of my country
We are the masters of our enemies
We are the saviors of my life
So be it until there is no enemy
Find peace within

[Verse 2: Dom PaChino]
I wield the silent weapon for this quiet war that's instore
My physical's on a world tour, my brain is wagin war in the urban
Send the blocks stacked like castles
They call them project housin, arousin anger
Define who's being distributed, new faces prohibited
In this wild life I'm livin in, there's a new millenium
Got my adrenaline, roarin like an engine
Camouflage ninjas, avengin

My rifle and myself are defenders of my country
We are the masters of our enemies
We are the saviors of my life
So be it until there is no enemy
Find peace within

[Verse 3: Beretta 9]
My thoughts travel far beyond the galaxies
Praise hard to shootin stars
Deadly bombin for the cause wildcat
Razor close likes it in the innocent, the five percent
Attribute, roll God Allah, fuck the government
I design military warheads with infrared
Gotta be sled - oh shit here come the feds
Don't move or you're dead, niggas fled like fugitives
Considered non-dangerous the way niggas don't pertain to this
Killarmy breath of this bullshit ignorance
As I overtake the sun, multiply deaf and dumb
Victims of illusions, don't understand confusion
I let my thoughts be born of poetry show and proven
Do we be the chosen on the uprise, eighty fives
Don't realize to check for these bad guys with the snake eyes
The poisonous venom's cold wettin lives
Killarmy on the return like the Jedi

This is my rifle
There are many like it but this one is mine
My rifle and myself are defenders of my country
We are the masters of our enemies
We are the saviors of my life
So be it until there is no enemy
Find peace within
This is my rifle
There are many like it but this one is mine
My rifle is my best friend
It is my life
I must master it as I must master my life
Without me my rifle is useless
Without my rifle I am useless
I must fire my rifle true
I must shoot straighter than my enemy who is trying to kill me
I must shoot him before he shoots me
I will
