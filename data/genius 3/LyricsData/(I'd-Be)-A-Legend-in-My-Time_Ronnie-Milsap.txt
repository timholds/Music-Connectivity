If heartaches brought fame
In love's crazy game
I'd be a legend in my time
If they gave gold statuettes
For tears and regrets
Id be a legend in my time

But they dont give awards
And theres no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love thats in vain

If loneliness meant world acclaim
Ev'ryone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time

But they dont give awards
And theres no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love thats in vain

If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then ev'ryone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time
I'd be a legend in my time
