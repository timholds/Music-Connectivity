[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Loved you so bad, best I ever had
North star turned black
Can't find my way back

[Chorus]
You wanted forever
Forever for free
If I gave you forever
Double Infinity
You wanted forever
Forever for free
If I gave you forever
What would you give to me?

[Intro]

[Verse 2]
After the afterglow, you're two faces start to show
I've been waiting for the one I know

[Chorus]
You wanted forever
Forever for free
If I gave you forever
Double Infinity
You wanted forever
Forever for free
If I gave you forever
What would you give to me?

[Intro]

[Outro]
All my panic streaks
Are you still waiting for me?
All my panic streaks
Are you still waiting for me?
Of all the future visions shine
Diamonds burning in my eye
All my panic streaks
I disappeared into your life
I could've been your neon sign
All the panic streaks
Are you waiting for me?
Are you still waiting for me?
Are you still waiting for me?
Are you still waiting for me?
