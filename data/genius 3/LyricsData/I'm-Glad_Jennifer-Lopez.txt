[Verse 1]
Baby when I think about
(bout, bout, bout, bout)
The day that we first met
(the day that we first met)
Wasn't looking for what I found
(found found)
But I found you
And I'm bound to
Find happiness in being around you

[Chorus]
I'm glad when I'm making love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it cause you seem to blow my mind
Every time
I'm glad when you walk you hold my hand
I'm happy that you know how to be a man
I'm glad that you came into my life
I'm so glad

[Verse 2]
I dig the way that you get down
(you get down thugged out)
And you still know how to hold me
(and you still know how to hold me)
Perfect blend, masculine
(can't get enough now)
I think I'm in love
Damn finally!

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I'm glad
That you
Turned out
To be
That certain someone special
Who makes this life worth living
I'm glad
You're here
Just loving me
So say that you won't leave
'Cause since the day you came
I've been glad

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus]
