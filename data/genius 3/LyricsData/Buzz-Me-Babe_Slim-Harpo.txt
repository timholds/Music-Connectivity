You buzz me babe, on your telephone
You buzz me babe, on your telephone
Wanna know from you baby, stayin' still goin' on

While I'm young babe, and I'm still in my prime
While I'm young babe, and I'm still in my prime
Wanna love you baby, while I still have time

When I'm old babe, and can't stand no more
When I'm old babe, and can't stand no more
I wanna hug and kiss you baby, and I think I'll let you go
