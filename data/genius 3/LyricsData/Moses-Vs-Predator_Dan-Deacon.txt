Time
All I have is time(?)
I have time on my mind
I have time on a pine
I don't need these bees on my sneeze
I don't need these boats made of coats
I don't need these note made of tone
I don't needs these beasts made of bees
I just need one farm(?)
One farm and a gun(?)
One (?) made of stone(?)
One (?) made of coast(?)
One mostly ghost with the most(?)
I don't need no lactated toast
I don't need beast made of bees
I don't need no time made of slime
I just need one guy

Sometimes you feel let down like a rope(?)
Sometimes you feel let down like a towel(?)
I know
Sometimes these people try to make it down(?)
Sometimes these people try to make it round(?)
I know
Bees
There's bees on my knees
There's bees at the place(?)
I got bees on the fleece
These bees get most with the bone
I don't get no range with the bones
I don't get no rhythm in the thrones
I don't get no songs in my bones
I just get one bee
Five guys
Ten guys
Five mice
