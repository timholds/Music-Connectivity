[Hook: Belly]
You must have heard about the re-up
Call me real late, you know I'll be up
That's the only time you ever free up
I'm not tryna fuck the energy up
She said, baby, please don't get the wrong idea
Roll the tree and fuck this Hennessey up
I come down and start to get ideas
All my demons keep on waking me up

[Verse 1: NAV]
Born alone, die alone
I let the drugs take my soul
First time I bought some weed I was sold
If I get 40 thousand for a show
I'm scared I'll spend 20 thousand on some dope
Either RAF or Ricky on my toes
In high school I never made the honor roll
Poppin' mollies, I've been on a roll
Hope the highway doesn't take a toll
Smokin' blunts, burn the seat in the Rolls
No, I'm not the same NAV from before
I don't know who I am anymore
Woke up somewhere I ain't been before
Half a pill ain't enough anymore
They rappin' about drugs they never did before
What's fake and what's real? I don't know anymore
Takin' full bars, I should really split 'em
Fell on my face, had to really quit 'em
My broski up north whippin' in the kitchen
My uncle just lost his kidney
That won't stop me from poppin' and sippin'
You can tell that I'm gone from a distance
Poppin' prescriptions without a prescription
Told Santa, all I want is molly for Christmas

[Hook: Belly]
Re-up
Call me real late, you know I'll be up
That's the only time you ever free up
I'm not tryna fuck the energy up
She said, baby, please don't get the wrong idea
Roll the tree and fuck this Hennessey up
I come down and start to get ideas
All my demons keep on waking me up

[Verse 2: Belly]
Got a hell of a habit, take another tablet out the cabinet
Is there heaven for a savage, is there heaven for a savage?
I'm poppin' pills like an addict
The trap - how I learned mathematics
Is there heaven for a savage, is there heaven for a savage?
Bags under my eyes cause I go hard
Probably cost more than the Goyard
Probably why I got a cold heart
Probably why I got to shine cause my life has been so dark, man
Pull up, bring your friend - that's a trio
Show up unannounced like my PO
You know the deal, the batch made her bend over backwards like Neo
I'm crazy but maybe I'm torn aside
I'm talkin' 'bout drugs like I glorify it
The truth is that I'm fuckin' horrified
I only slept twice in like 40 nights
Man, I'm on the back, she on the poltergeist
Man, I should just start takin' my own advice
Cause nowadays love is just overpriced, man

[Hook: Belly]
You must have heard about the re-up
Call me real, ain't you know I be up?
That's the only time you ever free up
I'm not tryna fuck the energy up
She said, baby, please don't get the wrong idea
Roll the tree and fuck this Hennessey up
I come down and start to get ideas
All my demons keep on waking me up
