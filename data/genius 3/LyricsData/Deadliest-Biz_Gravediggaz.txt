[Intro: Poetic]
Yo, don't bother me, kid, let a nigga live plus eat
Bless the wiz and protect my seed, yo

[Verse 1: Frukwan]
I filter distortion like a magnet, attract rappin' bandits
Stretch 'em and blast 'em over the canvas
Blatant replies to that blast my exercise won't be televised
Due to the rise of spirits or my transparent perseverance
Fuck a publishers clearance, Gatekeep's running an interference
Yo, you can dissect it, the black prospector
I'm cold as a pirate's luger, choke on my Heimlich maneuver
I breathe life in the fire when my designs are tight like pliers
Born in a pillow of barbed wire
Taught by Ebenezer Scrooge in my mom's church choir
The death stalker, New York trendtogrophy
The G-O-D, 120 degree geography
The bronze thick iron skin without a blemish
Black art of war chemist
Carry out the death sentence with deadly vengeance
What I'm seeking is your head on a skillet
Soakin' in burgundy liquid
Self inflected wounds fill pounds in Grant's tomb
And more damage than a monsoon
Niggas explode like aquatic moons
I mutate your functions
Like a divine evil after midnight in Broadway junction

[Hook: Poetic]
Keep it pumpin, yo, yo, yo
Anything you're given can be taken away
Any place anywhere any time any day
Gravedigga forever so whatever kid
Hip hop is like the deadliest biz
But yo can a nigga live, pay the rent, bless the wiz
Master the art and still not get blast in the heart

[Verse 2: Poetic]
You're just a weakling seeking to peep Grym's steelo
I sting like mosquitoes, ten times as lethal
The skill of my tongue is similar to Attila the Hun
Swinging a sword, Grym is gruesome
World renown like hunger
The mighty hunter in the concrete junga
Doper than ganja, conquer any style you can conjure
Take your momma's breath away like anacondas
Fronters get cast asunder, lightening fast I bring thunder
Ancient rules blast the mic, crushing fools paradise
Leaving you parasites under ground
Beef is shredded, paramedics'll greet you
I defeat crews with parametric EQs
All types of anastetics'll be used
My pressure's like the barometric when I squeeze you, hahaha
Removed of this earthly ball of clay
Let the chips fall where they may
I'll be servin' you all day everyday
Consider you a serious threat, heh anyway...

[Hook: Poetic]
Gravedigga forever so whatever kid
Hip hop is like the deadliest biz
But can a nigga live, pay the rent, bless the wiz
Master the art and not get blast up in the heart
Gravedigga forever so whatever kid
Hip hop is like the deadliest biz
But can a nigga live, pay the rent, bless the wiz
Master the art and not get blast up in the heart

[Outro: Poetic]
What, yo (Yo)
Gravediggaz (Forever)
'97 and beyond (Beyond) word is bond (word is bond)
Keep keep keepin' it on to the break of dusk to dawn
Yo, yo, yo, yo
Rzarector, Undertaker, Gatekeeper, the Grym Reaper
Yo, caught you in the sleeper
Gravediggaz forever
