Duu-duu- duu-duu duru
Duu-duu- duu-duu duru
You told me to forget about you
That's exactly what I'll do
Now let's pretend we never met
And stay that way until, until one morning
Suitcase in hand, dancing up my street
Sunrise shine right through her
I can't believe it's me she's here to see
Trying to forget you!
You might be far apart
I'm gonna get you out of my heart
You told me to forget about you
And that's what I've been trying to do
Duu-duu- duu-duu duru
Duu-duu- duu-duu duru
Now, here is your lovesong
It's true and clumbsy as they ever come
My little Heart Bomb
Dancing to the beating of the drumb
Trying to forget you!
You might be far apart
I can't get you out of my heart
You told me to forget about you
And that's just what I try to do
But I'm a believer, a lucky achiever
You've got your stories and I've got mine
Hold me tighter, feel so right'eh?
My head on your shoulder to hide the tears
Aaaaaah aaaah aaaaah
Hop on, we're far apart
I can't get you out of my heart
You told me to forget about you
But I'm gonna have to change your attitude
Hold me tighter, feel so right'eh?
My face on your shoulder to hide the tears
Want your sweater, it's worth all of the letters
And as I face your head, I think I'll wait another year
