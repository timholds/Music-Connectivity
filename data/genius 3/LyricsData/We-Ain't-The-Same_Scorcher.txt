(Scorcher)
Eh!...Oi' Listen!....I'm back up in this bitch like I never left
For as long as I'm spittin' they'll be second best
I'm only goin' shot, they say I'm settin' trends
They call it turnin' on my swag, I'm just gettin' dressed
Skywalker everythin', fly' over everythin'
If you see me on the ground, try an' know am checkin' in
I'm buyin' what I like, 'cah I get it in
All these rappers copyin' my style now, S&M
(Uh)
But I'm cool as a fan, top chef swag, put it all in a pan
Linesman at best, you ain't ballin' wid man
If I high five his rounds an applause when I rap
I get an encore, when I'm on tour, gun fingers up like they want war
(Huh)
I started out at the bottom, but now I'm top draw
N***** talkin' 'bout "let's collaborate"..."what for?"

(Loick Essien's Chorus)
You N***** ain't fuckin' wit me, I'm hard as hell, Only it ain't hard to tell, my n***** are off the rails
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Only we ain't the same, homie this ain't a game
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
You N***** ain't fuckin' wit me, we hard as nails, try it an' you'll hurt yourself, my n***** are off the rails
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Only we ain't the same, homie this ain't a game
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
I got a killer cool face, murders in the buildin'
Turnin' up my swag, hurtin' n***** feelings
Used to want a grand, workin' on a million
You can have her back, I just squirt her wit my children
Money so long, I can't figure what to spend it on
Louis V now, Mummy used to buy me beneton
You don't get it in, bruda how we gonna get along?
You ain't talkin' wizzy, why the fuck you on my telephone!?
Can't tell me nuttin' I'm kanye, I'm braggers
Sittin' at the top, laughin' at suckers
Money you'll whip but I wan' an R for ma' summer
Shittin' on the game, wipe my arse with a one'er
I'm a stunner
Makin' bottles pop, we ain't gotta shot
My music minds good, but I want the lot
I want that blow money, I want that show money
They'll be a snow-ball in hell, when I got no money...

(Loick Essien's Chorus)
You N***** ain't fuckin' wit me, I'm hard as hell, Only it ain't hard to tell, my N***** are off the rails
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Only we ain't the same, homie this ain't a game
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
You N***** ain't fuckin' wit me, we hard as nails, try it an' you'll hurt yourself, my N***** are off the rails
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Only we ain't the same, homie this ain't a game
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Changin' the weather, makin' it better
Makin' so much money, that I can't even count the figures
(Scorcher)
I got!
(Loick Essien)
So much money, so much money...
(Scorcher & Loick Essien)
Money! money!!
(Loick Essien)
Well how'd he do is make it rain!
Ye, Yeah, Yeah (Solo vocal)
(Scorcher)

(Loick Essien)
Yeeeeaaaahhh!
(Scorcher)
Staples!
Oww!

(Loick Essien's Chorus)
You N***** ain't fuckin' wit me, I'm hard as hell, Only it ain't hard to tell, my n***** are off the rails
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Only we ain't the same, homie this ain't a game
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
You N***** ain't fuckin' wit me, we hard as nails, try it an' you'll hurt yourself, my n***** are off the rails

Only we ain't the same, homie this ain't a game
(Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
