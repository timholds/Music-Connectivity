[Verse 1]
We've seen it all, me and this old guitar
Sweatin' it out in these cowboy bars
With the lost souls
Winners, losers and cheaters
Done everything you can do in here
Late nights, fist fights, strippin' my gears
I've had a good time
I know where to draw the line

[Chorus]
I don’t dance, that’s something I don’t do
I don’t dance, I bring it home to you
Standin' up here in the smoke and the lights
I know who’s gonna hold me tonight
I don’t dance, or play with the truth
Take a chance of ever losin'
You’re the only one I sing my love songs to
I don’t dance with anybody but you

[Verse 2]
Oh temptation
She comes in here to get me
Waltzin' through the music and the whiskey
Me and that old devil goin' a round or two
Yeah those cowgirls, yeah they sure look fine
And they go to gettin' lonely 'round closin' time
I know what their eyes are sayin'
When that old song starts playin'

[Chorus]
I don’t dance, that’s something I don’t do
I don’t dance, I bring it home to you
Standin' up here in the smoke and the lights
I know who’s gonna hold me tonight
I don’t dance, or play with the truth
Take a chance of ever losin'
The only one I sing my love songs to
I don’t dance with anybody but you

[Outro]
I don’t dance, or play with the truth
Take a chance of ever losin'
The only one I sing my love songs to
I don’t dance with anybody but you
