[Intro]
Brothers and sisters
Brothers and sisters, I don't know what this world's coming to

[Verse 1: Chuck D]
Yes - the rhythm, the rebel
Without a pause - I'm lowering my level
The hard rhymer - where you never been I'm in
You want styling - you know it's time again
D the enemy - telling you to hear it
They praised the music - this time they play the lyrics
Some say no to the album, the show
Bum Rush The Sound - I made a year ago
I guess you know - you guess I'm just a radical
Not on sabbatical - yes to make it critical
The only part your body should be parting to
Panther power on the hour from the rebel to you

[Flavor Flav]
Hey yo Chuck, I don't understand this man!
Yo, we got to slow down man, we losing them!

[Verse 2: Chuck D]
Radio - suckers never play me
On the mix - they just O.K. me
Now known and grown when they're clocking my zone it's known
Snaking and taking everything that a brother owns
Hard - my calling card
Recorded and ordered - supporter of Chesimard
Loud and proud kicking live next poet supreme
Loop a troop, bazooka, the scheme
Flavor - a rebel in his own mind
Supporter of my rhyme
Designed to scatter a line of suckers who claim I do crime
They on my time ticket

[Flavor Flav]
Yo chuck, they think we takin shorts!
Show em this is cold medina

[Hook]
Terminator X, Terminator X
Terminator X, Terminator

[Flavor Flav:]
Yo chuck, you gettin' em nervous they can't handle this, they gonna breakdown

[Verse 3: Chuck D]
From a rebel it's final on black vinyl
Soul, rock and roll coming like a rhino
Tables turn - suckers burn to learn
They can't disable the power of my label
Def Jam - tells you who I am
The enemy's public - they really give a damn
Strong Island - where I got 'em whylin'
That's the reason they're claiming that I'm violent
Never silent - no dope getting dumb nope
Claiming where we get our rhythm from
Number one - we hit ya and we give ya some
No gun - and still never on the run
You wanna be an S.1 - Griff will tell you when
And then you'll come again you'll know what time it is
Impeach the president - pulling out my ray-gun
Zap the next one - I could be your Shogun
Suckers - don't last a minute
Soft and smooth - I ain't with it
Hardcore - rawbone like a razor
I'm like a laser - I just won't graze ya
Old enough to raise ya - so this'll faze ya
Get it right boy and maybe I will praise ya
Playing the role, I got soul too
Voice my opinion with volume
Smooth - not what I am
Rough - 'cause I'm a man
No matter what the name - we're all the same
Pieces - in one big chess game
Yeah - the voice of power
Is in the house - go take a shower boy
P.E. a group, a crew - not singular
We wear black Wranglers
We're rap stranglers
You can't angle us - I know you're listening
I caught you pissin' in your pants
You're scared of us dissing us
The crowd is missing us
We're on a mission y'all

[Flavor Flav]
Yo Chuck! yeah man!
Yo you got em runnin' scared!

[Hook]
Terminator X, Terminator X
Terminator X, Terminator

[Verse 4]
Attitude - when I'm on fire
Juice on the loose - electric wire
Simple and plain - give me the lane
I'll throw it down your throat like Barkley
You see my car keys - you'll never get these
They belong to the 98 posse
You want some more son - you wanna get some
Bum rush the door of a store - pick up the album
You know the rhythm, the rhyme plus the beat is designed
So I can enter your mind, boys!
Bring the noise - my time
Step aside for the flex - Terminator X

[Flavor Flav]
Yeah that's right
This jam is rated cold medina, boy
That's right, cold medina, that's right
We showin' up in E-F-F-E-C-T also known as effect
You understand what I'm sayin'?

[Outro]
Yeah! Yeah boy!
Bring that beat back
Bring that beat back one more time, Chuck
Y'all wanna hear that beat, right?
Bring that beat back
