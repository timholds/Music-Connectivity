The moment that you smiled
Is when it all began
And in no time at all
We were best of friends

The moment that we kissed
The feeling grew and grew
And in no time at all
I was loving you

And in no time at all
You lead me right inside your heart
We thought that we had it all
Never dreaming love could fall apart

So when the ending came
And took me by surprise
'Cause in no time at all
You told me goodbye...
