Excuse my attitude, I may seem like I'm mad at you
I made my own lane so stay the fuck in your avenue
I'm radical, fanatical, the cannibal with antidotes
To cure the rap game, yet I keep it maniacal
I'm bouncing off the walls, watch me catapult
The track assault, add the salt, I'm eating it up like Hannibal
Beating it up like Pacquiao, top of the charts like Manilow
I can't tell if you fan or foe, but I'm reaching the height of this track's title
Yo!

But if I keep getting green, I'mma end up like Piccolo
So you can kiss my ass under the fucking Mistletoe
I may be 16, but I follow basic principals
My works have to stay creative and original
Fuck you little faggits wearing skinny jeans and acting tough
Posing with a cute smile, go ahead laugh it up
I'll be smacking up these faggits cuz they ain't man enough
To stand up to me, nigga they scared to battle us
I stand out like a mammal laying eggs, Platypus
Rappers hold your horses, for a while I've been saddled up
On 6'7, all 6's and 7's, add it up
Tech N9ne rhymes, I bet I can spit it quicker than Cory's verse
In a point of no return, leave you with a gory curse
I stole your purse, the story's worse, I went, got me a whory nurse
To blow my jerked off horny flirt, then slowly spermed, I'm so absurd
Gotta slow it down, like my syndrome is down
Bound to blow a pound of Krypt in Overtown
So what you wanna say? I'll put you on a fucking plate
I'll put a fork to your brain and a blade through your veins
I'm harder than the world's biggest diamond to the last grain
You must think I'm playing because my life is about the game
I'm about to reign, not money or wetness, but bow to the king!
I'm blackin' out, straight spazzin' out so bad that I surpass the doubt
From my last account, I'm the master now
Your girl be sucking my dick, she knows the deal, I never asked her out
Her ass been getting passed around like a blunt at a grasser's house
While the party's still crashin' out
Go ahead nigga ask around
CiNo's bound to pass your town
So don't get all passive now, if you wanna scrap let's pound!
I'm ready for whatever, I'm just venting my vendetta
You'll look like I flatted you and put you straight down a shredder
You dont want no problems with me, I'mma have to solve 'em quickly
Thinking that you hotter than me? Go ahead, try to rip me
Hating on my rapping skills, all I see is daffodils
A bunch of fucking Daffy Ducks, run yall over with a Batmobile
Yeah, I know yall cold with chills
When CiNo touch it it's overkill
Bitch!
