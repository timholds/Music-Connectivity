[Chorus x2: Holocaust]
This is doomsday for MCs with hollow skills
Who talk about clothing articles and dollar bills
And fake ass rides that they don't even drive
Hip Hop's war and only strong MCs will survive

[Verse 1: Holocaust]
Half dead platoon leader awoken by enemy heaters
Juggernaut on the block, lash shots at armed retreaters
Why teach it to the utmost unified, fuck coasts
Conquered galaxies leaving a banner of ruthless cut-throats
Brains explode, bloody spatters on the road
My thoughts unfold and strip away the nutrients of your soul
Hearts cold, blast shots through your nosehole, I'm hostile
The slugs ricochet through your nostril, strike your tonsils
Black kid, creep between walls like an arachnid
Smash hits that open you like bullets with glass tips
Kill Grave, the black sea serpent who swallows ships
My fists become Glocks and my knuckles hollow tips
Part the dirt and raise dead soldiers with a curse
Bury thieves with no headstones so they give back to the earth
Still shining, I'm the Sun, wars increase by the tonne
Hands metamorph into axes, fuck guns, chop out your lungs

[Chorus x2]

[Verse 2: Beretta 9]
We may bomb this but seem harmless, check the calmest
My palm hits like a closed fist, break your jaw with this
You crab ass try to think fast, you best to slow down
All six got trey pounds, it's thirty six rounds
Of pristine, unheard, unseen, the 'A-Team'
Murdock, B.A. Barac, Face, the Red Beam
Street hop, excite bike, took all my smokescreens
Sped fast, five hundred crabs have fled the crime scene
Out of state, switch the plates, cannon ball run dunn
Sped fast, rub on the gas, here come the blast
On their ninja bike, Kawasaki type 2B prototype
Sure we still got height, then I made a right
Hit the brake, threw a head fake, last the clutch, I'm out of state
Full speed ahead, never look back, always escape

[Chorus x2]

[P.R. Terrorist]
Laid in the dark war trench, covered in mud strong corpse stench
Monkey wrench, adjusting my mic, fatigues drenched
From soldiers insides, scriptures hidden up in my archives
Dodge and throw knives, hand-to-hand combat taking lives
Many lost, many took it wit force, some linger
With the disease bomb infection known as the bee stinger
Its doomsday you rap singers, Mockingbirds marking my words
This shit is war up in the terrorist arena

[Chorus x2]

This is Doomsday
