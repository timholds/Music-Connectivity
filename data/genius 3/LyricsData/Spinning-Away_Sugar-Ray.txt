Up on a hill
As the day dissolves
With my pencil turning moments into life
One by one, all the stars appear
As the great winds of the planet spiral in
Spinning away, like the night sky
In the million insect storm, the constellations form
On a hill, under a raven sky
I have no idea exactly where I've been
Some kind of change, some kind of spinning away
With every single line moving further out in time

Spinning away, like the night sky
I have no idea exactly where I've been
And here, or there
And here, or there
Some kind of spinning away

And here, or there
And here, or there
And here, or there
And here, or there
And here, or there
And here, or there
