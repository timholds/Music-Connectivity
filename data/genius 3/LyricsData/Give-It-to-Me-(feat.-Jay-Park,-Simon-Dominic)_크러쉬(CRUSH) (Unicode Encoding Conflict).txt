[Intro]
Get up (up, up)
[Simon]

Get up (up, up)
[Jay]
Yeah
Unh
Com' on
Aye

[Verse 1: Crush]
Gonna take you on a ride
Our skin will touch tonight
Forget about your man for a moment, ooo baby

Lying is bad so I will blame it on the alcohol
Start by taking off your clothes, I wanna melt your body

Take it slow (slow) (aahuuhh (aahuuhh))
Slow (slow) (aahuuhhh (aahuuhhh))
I know (I know) what you want
Turn off your phone until it’s over

[Chorus: Crush]
Give it to me (yeah)
Give it to me (woah oh woah) (your body’s)
All that I need (yea yeaah)
I’ll touch your body more than your heart
I want to hold you girl (yeaaah)

[Post-Chorus]
Babe slow down, baby, babe slow down
[Crush] (woah ohh woah woah woahoo wooo ooohh waaaah)
Babe slow down, baby, babe slow down
Babe slow down, baby, babe slow down
[Jay] Yeah
[Crush] (ooo oooo oooo oooo)
Babe slow down, baby, babe slow down

[Jay]
AOMG
Let's go

[Verse 2: Jay Park]
Welcome to my bed, baby
Welcome me in between your legs, baby
Tonight, I’ll be your teacher, baby (let's get it on)
Let’s start with some simple math, baby (oh yeah)
First, take off your clothes
Second, separate your smooth legs
Me plus you is a hot night, a sexy night
I’ll never let you go (ooo wooo oh oh oh)

[Chorus: Jay Park]
Give it to me (yeaaah)
Give it to me (woah oh woah) (your body’s)
All that I need (yea yeaaaah)
I’ll touch your body more than your heart
I want to hold you girl

[Bridge: Crush & Jay Park]
I’ll do it until you’re satisfied
I have to see the end, baby
Each one of your fingers will be electrified
[Crush](yeeaaaaah yeah)

The temperature is rising on the bed
All wet with sweat, your body becomes an ocean
You lose your mind more and more
You want me to go harder, I wanna hear you
Say ah ah ah

[Verse 3: Simon Dominic]
Unh
You can have high expectations for tonight
I can control you
The blanket that was wet with our spit and sweat from a couple of days ago is still drying
You’re my nutella, dip my stick in it and bite on it? It’ll be the best fondue
Let’s make everything tonight baby
Yesterday, we made it soft, typical mellow shit
During the day, I let it go your way
So you need to be punished now
You won’t be in the right state of mind
But this time, you let it go my way
You have to leave early in the morning but I take it off anyway
I have no thoughts on finishing it just once
I’m true playa, so I fuck a lot

[Chorus: Crush]
Give it to me (yeah)
Give it to me (woah oh woah) (your body’s)
All that I need (yeah)
I’ll touch your body more than your heart
I want to hold you girl (yeaaah)

[Outro]
Babe slow down, baby, babe slow down
Babe slow down, baby, babe slow down
Babe slow down, baby, babe slow down
Babe slow down, baby, babe slow down
