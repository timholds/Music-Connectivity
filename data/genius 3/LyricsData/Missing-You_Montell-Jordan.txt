Huh, yeah
I wanna tell you about this lady
She's so special to me
I want you all to know about her
Know what I'm saying?
Yo, check this out

I got a new lady in my life
And it hurts so much to say goodbye
Every time I'm on the road
In my hotel room alone
I stare at your picture, I miss you
I wanna come home

1 - I miss you so
Counting the tears on my pillow
Nobody knows quite like I know
How I'm missing you
And when those teardrops fall like rain
I don't wanna feel like this again
You hear what I'm saying?
Sydney, I'm missing you

Da-Da's home
I'm gonna sweep you off your feet
Hold you in my arms and sing you to sleep
When you're crying
I am going to dry your weeping eyes
Rock you in the midnight hour
Tonight I realize

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

Let me hear you say
Da-Da, Da-Da
The first words you said are ringing in my head again
Da-da, da-da, oh da-da
Everytime I go away, I'm missing you
Everyday

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Ad lib until fade
