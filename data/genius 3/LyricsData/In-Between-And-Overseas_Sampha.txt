[Chorus]
If this is genuine lunacy
Then famously you've done to me
In between us is an ocean, an ocean full of minds
Enough to change the tides
In between and overseas

[Verse 1]
[?]  empathy, I
Seen me walking through the meadows
Straight towards the light
Somewhere to reside

[Pre-Chorus]
And we see the sun, the sun
It helps more than a little bit
I, I realize, I
I think I love you, I do

[Chorus]
If this is genuine stupidity
Then famously you've loved me, I
You see I wish I had the potion
To make this into time
And an amazing life

[Verse 2]
When I scream, you arrive
To tell me bout your jaded skies, I
You see we're deep beneath the ocean
Beneath the rocks and ice
Cause you roll up the blinds

[Outro]
And we see the sun, the sun
It helps more than a little bit
I, I realize, I
I think I love you, I do
