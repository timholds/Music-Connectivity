[Hook:]
Yea, you see me, you see me
I make 'em overstand
You see me, you see me, I make 'em overstand, shawdy
You see me, you see me
Oh yea, a player so fly, yea, I could throw it in the wind
My money don't fold a bit
Bitch I get stacks, hey, what it is?
Yea, you  see me gettin' paper and forgot that I'mma spend
A player so fly, I could throw it in the wind
Can ya dig that? (I can dig that)!
Can ya dig that? (I can dig that)!
My rims blacked out and my whip snow white
I've been gettin' paid, this ain't happen overnight
Can ya dig that? (I can dig that)!
Can ya dig that? (I can dig that)!

[Bridge:]
Hey, they said money don't come on trees
That's what they told me
But, I beg to differ all this money we be growin'
Sippin' (?) throwin' bread, beast
Niggas stay out my yard cause the picture's on the lease
I swerve through my city
Got, brain like a genius
Not, even 21 already read my (?)
My better music better dirty, so Oprah can't clean it
My top's still here, even though you ain't seen it

[Bridge:]

[Verse: Big KRIT]
Another magic trick for these square ass lames
I'm so iced out you can call me David Blaine
I'm so pure in lines you would think I was cocaine
Shawdies just take a taste
KRIT I can't feel my face
I'm concrete hard and you stripper ass soft
I'm married to my money and I like to fuck her raw
My rubberbands pop, my stacks don't fold
They paper (?) 20's, my money gettin' old

[2nd half of Hook:]

[Outro:]
I make 'em overstand (you see me, you see me)
I make 'em overstand (you see me, you see me)
I make 'em overstand (you see me, you see me)
I make 'em overstand (you see me, you see me)
Can you dig that?
