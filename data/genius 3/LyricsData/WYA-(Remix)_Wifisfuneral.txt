[Verse 1 - wifisfuneral]
Aye, Okay
See my life just an illusion
What we doing? what's the motive?
I just spent too many goddamn bands in my pants
Can't control me, now you know me
Girl I'm going somewhere that you never knowin'
Hold it slowly, ay damn
I'm the man in my city, baby girl
Yeah, you know me, went from 30 people shows
Out the nation wide tourin'
Been like all around the globe
All these hoes say they adore me but
I had to bring it back, where's it at? yeah, it's that
I probably had to relapse off the flat
It was that, now I'm off it like no other
Motherfuck em' if they hating on my squad
Damn, they broke we flexin' hundreds
I just pulled up in that ghost, with the most
On that fuck shit, what's up shit
I'm all up in the function, what's up shit
Now you hit my line as if you mine
Bitch I'm dead ass shit
Never could I love you like no other
Never love a bitch
Never could I love you like no other
Never love a bitch

[Verse 2 - Ugly God]
Aye, girl, you know I hate it
When you leave, bring it back
I ain't rich but I'm workin' on it
Tryna get to that
Heard you want a athlete with a mansion
Guess I'm wack
Shit, I'm sorry I can't dribble
Catch a ball, or swing a bat
Girl, I thought you was my baby
Now I'm callin', where ya at?
Haven't ate a thing lately
Girl, I'm starvin', where ya at?
Now you got me goin' crazy
I keep callin', where ya at?
Stupid bitch when I find you
I'm gon' up you with this gat
Matter fact, fuck it
I don't give a fuck anyway
I see that you livin' happy
So I'm happy that you straight
To be honest, bitch, I get it
You ain't love me any way
Now I'm back at square one
My daddy told me play it safe
Bitch, you fake
Now we barely even talk
You put my feelings in a vault
I'm comin' clean, baby girl
Just bein' honest
Truthfully, I really tried my best
But you packed your shit and left
Damn, why the fuck you break a pinky promise?
Shoulda done me right
You know where we could be at
But you did it to yourself
And walked me over like a mat
Since you ain't been in the picture
Shit, my pockets gettin' fat
So when you doin' down bad
I swear that I ain't lookin' back
And that's a fact, aye
