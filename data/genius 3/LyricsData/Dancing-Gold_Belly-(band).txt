Is there a tree
That grows the fruit I need?
Something sour to make me sweet
Ok, I'll eat
Ok, I'll eat
Ok, I'll eat
Nothing better than a frozen tree
(Deep pulling down down)
Someone's frozen bag of oranges
Stick my tongue in their mouth
Ok, I'll eat
Ok, I'll eat
Ok, I'll eat
Will you go when the water goes?
Will you go dancing gold?
Don't put me in your heart
I'll outgrow it, I'll outgrow it, I'll outgrow it
Dancing gold, orange grove
Is there a seed to plant the tree
That grows the fruit I need?
Something sour to make me sweet
Ok, I'll eat
Ok, I'll eat
Ok, I'll eat
Will you go when the water goes?
Will you go dancing gold?
Don't put me in your heart
I'll outgrow it, I'll outgrow it, I'll outgrow it
Dancing gold, orange grove
Will you go when the water goes?
Will you go dancing gold?
Dancing gold, orange grove
Dancing gold, orange grove (dancing gold, orange grove)
Dancing gold, orange grove
Dancing gold, orange grove (dancing gold, orange grove)
Dancing gold, orange grove
Dancing gold, orange grove (dancing gold, orange grove)
Dancing gold, orange grove
Dancing gold, orange grove
