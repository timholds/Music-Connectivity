Let's go back, back, back
To when I used to shapeshift
And shift right back
Before I picked up the mic
I started writing rhymes
I can alter my form it any given time
Shapeshift, shapeshift
Shape-shape-shift-shift
Shapeshift
Shapeshift, shapeshift
Shape-shape-shift-shit
Shapeshift

[Verse 1]
Let me take you back to the start
When I first started shapeshifting
After class a school bully wanted me kicked in
It was little D running for his life
With his heartbeat bu-bu-bu-bu-bumping inside
Morphed into a Cheetah
Them cheats couldn't keep up
Sixty miles per hour was his speed a was G 1
Going straight to my mother's arms
Even try to morph into a car a bus a shiny gold bar
Even Bret 'The Hitman' Hart
But my momma couldn't see it she just laughed
Giggled to herself
You're a crazy boy
Get in the bath
And you better scrub hard in those hard to reach parts
I was like, "nah"
I'm a superhero mom honest
You should of seen me earlier
Running like Sonic
The fools couldn't catch me
Believe I was on it
Watch me shapeshift, are you watching?

[Verse 2]
I'm a bird
I'm a tree
I'm a bike
I'm a plane
On the ground underneath your feet
I'm the rain in the sky
I'm a cloud
I'm a Sun
I'm a star
Pushing roots through Saturn's rings world's in my palm
I'm a bear
I'm a dog
I'm a chair so get off
I'm an action figure but I'm not trapped in the box
I'm free
Free with the world at my feet
Hummin A-Team's theme
As I'm running down the street
With my chalkboard knees
Sun shines, smile beams
If you're feeling hungry
I'm your quarter-pounder cheese
But if you're feeling angry
I'm your punch bug release but
Don't go too wild you might knock out my teeth
Huh, watch the kidneys beneath
I'm only a wee high
Still pee on the sheets
I still read The Beano
Every night after tea
Cause I'm drawing inspiration for the next thing to be
Then it's

[Hook]

[Bridge (X2)]
Transmute
Alter
Morph
Switch
I am lawless
You're a myth

[Verse three]
Spoilt for choice
Now my cranium aches
Cause my brains' in overdrive
All over the place
Inspirations running through my veins
Just turn my fist into a gobstopper think I might have a taste
I'm like a space-boot
Two steps out of this world
Surf the tablet of my mind across the ocean, I felt
Brainwaves help to excel
Hope will prevail
Push me to shore so I can be sure of myself
Now if you have these powers now
What would you do?
Would you morph into the Devil?
Would you help to improve the foundation of society?
What would you lose?
Would you morph into a yard and help your momma to move
I need some new shoes
About to turn into some Jordan 3's
The skin on my legs
Form a pair of denim jeans
Just morph my wrist into a gold watch
I'm blinged up
You need to come a little closer if you want to see
