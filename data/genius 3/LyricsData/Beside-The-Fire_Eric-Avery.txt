Take him newborn from a shell
Teach him how to buy and sell
Kill with a pill all of the dreams he lights
His dark room by each night

I don’t know why sometimes I lose my mind
When everything seems just fine

Take her naked from a shell
Taste the ocean in her well
Drink from her fingers all of the fly shes got
Then hang her on a nail to dry

I don’t know why sometimes I lose my mind
When everything seems just fine
Come take a seat beside the fire
