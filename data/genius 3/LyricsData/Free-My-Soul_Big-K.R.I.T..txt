[Hook]
Mama I made it
Got my chain now
I got that benz too
I got my Louis Vuitton
And my Gucci shoes
Mama I made it
Got those trues and vogues
I keep some groupie hoes
I got that old school
With those lambo doors
But I'm scared
It all ain’t enough
To free my soul
Lord mama I made it

[Verse 1]
Fuck what they talkin'
Nah it ain’t about talent
It’s no longer an art
Niggas piss on your canvas and parade
Ok, so you paved the way but I rode the road
Farther than you go before
But still you block the road some more
I'm on my last leg and they passing me by
With a sign that say I rap to eat
With both my thumbs in the sky
Damn, when will my time come?
Should I just sell dope, for money, cars, clothes & hoes?
Cause they say that's successful
'Til a nigga run up on you and unload
Cause he po' and you shine just like the moon glow
Stunting in your Bentley, but it cost you your soul
When God come to collect
I hope you got what you owe

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Forever dreaming
Wishing on a star for help
I give a nigga food for thought
He rather starve himself
Apart from wealth
I think it was the shine that got us blinded
Not sure of what we reading
When we signing our life away
They say ignorance is bliss
But I'd like to state
The game is just not recognizing real shit
They don’t like to play
You ghetto famous to us
You just Bojangles to them
Tap yo feet, tip yo brim
And sell it back to yo kin
I don't rap I spit hymns
My God's bigger than them
Tryin' to blacken your heart
And say we children of men
I sin cause I ain't perfect
But I rather save your life than hurt it; if I made it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Now what if all the things I'm fightin' for, oh lord
Don't get me where I'm going?
Now what if I don’t see the signs in time, oh lord
I'm praying that you show me...
Mama I made it

[Outro]
I feel sorry for you, kid
If you're smart, you take care of yourself
There's nothing you can do for anybody else
What difference you think you can make; one single man, in all this madness?
