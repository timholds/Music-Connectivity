[Pre-Hook:]
We like them boyz, with them rubber band bands
He move weight, keep a couple gram grams
So (so so so) where your money, put it in your hand hands
Now (now now now) make it flip, make it do a handstand. [x2]

[Hook:]
Do a handstand, can you do a hand stand
Flip that money, make it do a handstand
I can make it scream, like a summer jam fan
Where are my bands, where my "Rubber Band Mans"?

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
It's official, bang your pistols
Play your money it's funny, I mean it tickles
I need a D-boy, I need a president
And if you're spending them stacks, I need some evidence
Then you can bring out all them cars, that they rap about
Then I'm a let you eat it, like I put the snacks out
Don't say you can't, say you can, say you can can
Flip that money, flip it like a handstand

[Hook:]

[Verse 2: Shannell]
He's a banker by nature and he'll call and
Stick up the debt, that you owe and thank ya
He'll switch the toys out, never the same route
But niggas acting, like they ain't about to pay out
Taking me out, just to ask how my day went
Tryna show me, I'm his number one investment
He know what I like, stay on your job type
I'll pop if you can pop like you got rubber bands, we like

[Pre-Hook:]

[Hook:]

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj & Shannell]
Cause we like, bad boys and bad cars
Them hood rich, dope boys and trap stars. [x2]

[Verse 4: Shannell]
See I'm a rubber lover
So wrap it and I'll hug ya
Then we can stick together
Like them dollars out the printer
Bad boys I catch, call me undercover
Street grindin', cold cut mother- (fucker)

[Verse 5: Nicki Minaj]
Yo yo yo-
He flip like handstand, he cookin' them ten grams
Give him the grand slam, in back of the phan dam
I mean the phantom, I can't stand bums
Somethin' bout his money, make a nigga handsome
Cuff cuff, throw ya badge on me
Guaranteed, you can't puff puff, pass on me
We can crush crush, you can spend your stash on me
Cause I know, you want to smash, like a crash dummy

[Hook:]
