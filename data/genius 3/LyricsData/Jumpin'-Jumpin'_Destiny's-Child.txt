Ladies leave your man at home
The club is full of ballers and their pockets full grown
And all you fellas leave your girl with her friends
Cause it's eleven thirty and the club is jumpin', jumpin'

Though he say he got a girl
Yeah it's true you got a man
But the party ain't gon' stop
So let's make it hot, hot

[Verse 1]
Last weekend you stayed at home alone and lonely
Couldn't find your man, he was chilling with his homies
This weekend you're going out
If he try to to stop you, you're going off
You got your hair done and your nails done too
A new outfit and your Fendi shoes
And when you're through parlaying at the hottest spot
Tonight you're gonna find the fellas
Rollin' in the Lexus, drops and Hummers

Call your boys cause tonight you're not gonna stay at home
Should tell your girl she ain't coming tonight you're going solo
Cut her off cause she talk some noise
You know you got the right to get your party on
So get your haircut and your car washed too
Lookin' like a star in your Armani suit
You need to look your best cause you're turnin' heads tonight
You're gonna find a sexy chica that's gonna dance all night if you wanna

[Bridge]
Sexy women do that dance
Fly ladies work your man
Balling fellas time to clown
We can get down now

Bounce baby, bounce, bo-bounce bounce, bo-bounce, twirk it, twirk it
Shake baby, shake sha-shake shake, work it, work it
Twist baby, twist tw-twist, you better dip that thing
(One more time papis, mamis)

Bounce baby, bounce, bo-bounce bounce, bo-bounce, twirk it, twirk it
Shake baby, shake sha-shake shake, work it, work it
Twist baby, twist tw-twist, you better dip that thing
(Bounce it up and down papis mamis)
