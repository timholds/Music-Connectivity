5, 5am, it's so strange to be here again
Falling, falling down
Someone help me, before I hit the ground
[Wiley:]
These are the hours when I capture most of my
Magical moments on the power book, money by the hour book
Let them into my ward and show them how I took
A sound from there, a sound from here
Said I never leave the hood but now
I look back don't matter where you live you're alive and kicking
I'll always try and stop you tripping
But it's awkward if you slipping up yourself, I ain't perfect though
That's why I haven't stopped my search yet
Looking for what? I don't know, in the end it's all worthless
See the world's just a place full of workers
Non-workers earning like workers, born to not work
Feels like I ain't worked a day in my life but
I've worked every hour, work any hour
5am's cool; I get paid by the hour

[Chorus:]
[Scorcher:]
* Sigh *
Where's my phone?
What's the time?
What?
Can't be, can't be
5am and I can't sleep it's been the same for the past week
I've been up from morning, my daughters clogged up ???
I smile cus she's breathing; I turned on my line in the evening
It's Friday, I know I've gotta grind through the weekend
So even if it's 5 o'clock, there's no way that my grind can stop
My funds rising, the suns on the horizon, I stop and admire it
Then it's back to curb work, as the birds chirp
I'm out trying to catch the first worm
No hourglass, no sun dial as the hours pass, not one smile as
I wipe the cold from my eye; I'm colder than ice
I look down and the phone saying 5
5, 5am, it's so strange to be here again
Falling, falling down
Someone help me; help me before I hit the ground
5, 5am, it's so strange to be here again
5, 5am, it's so strange to be here again
5, 5am, it's so strange to be here again
Falling, falling down
Someone help me; help me before I hit the ground
One, Two-three, Four, Five, Five. (4x)
5, 5am, it's so strange to be here again
5, 5am, it's so strange to be here again
5, 5am, it's so strange to be here again
Falling, falling down
Someone help me; help me before I hit the ground
