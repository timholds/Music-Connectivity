[Verse 1]
I don’t see the same look in your eyes
One that used to say we’re meant to be
I can’t feel the hunger in your touch
You used to tell me I’m all you need

[Chorus]
It’s hard to stay or leaving her first
I’m not sure which one is the worst
Cause tonight I’ll hold the love I used to know
Listen to a heart letting go

[Verse 2]
Just how long it’s been I can’t recall
Since I felt the warmth of your kiss
Though all the little things you used to do
Are all the things that I already miss
It’s hard to stay leaving her first
I’m not sure which one is the worst
Cause tonight I’ll hold the love I used to know
Listen to a heart letting go
You decide to say goodbye
How am I suppose to live without you, I don’t know
Don’t know why I’m holding on
We both know that you’re already gone

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, tonight I’ll hold the love I used to know
Listen to a heart letting go, A heart letting go
