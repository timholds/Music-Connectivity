Weed loud with the odor
Alkalized water no soda
Buzzerbeater with the floater
Once i make lil flip game over


432hertz
New church
Bring the pain
The
Truth hurts
Won't let ya dim my shine

I didn't finish school first
Vonte in your
Youtube search
My words will give you goosebumps
Just like im RL Stine


Throwing bows
At
Overlords to overthrow em
Then I’ll go and
Smoke a bowl
Fire within when it’s 4below
Determined destiny no
4leaf clove
Yall
Eyewitness
Went 9 dimensions
Now the
Time glitchin
Its Bernstein not Bernstain
Skrt
Open wormholes in the turning lane
Earn the fortune and return the fame
I see my purpose with refined vision
Burning mary-jane while I’m on Mount olympus
I ride my vibe and always
Mind my  business

Won’t let a bitch do me like  Scottie Pippen
Got the
Style dripping through this foul system
4 I cop the rollie ima buy a business
Riding round my city I’m the

Witch doctor

At the round table no impastas
Get to split the pasta up  with the mafia

In yo head you got it twisted up but
You are not a lock for the rasta

You ain't make the team, get it, you are not with us

Ahead of who? That’s preposterous
Overlapped ya
Look closely you can see the distance  like it’s through binoculars

I Cruise through
Mission impossible


Move with my patnas
Like the 12 apostles

Even though we had to see murders (C-Murders) my brothers got no limits like the Silk the Shocker


Back on the ropes like a tired boxer
Still I push it farther just to lift the squad up

My girl is fine
How she looking now she gone get it later like Window
Shoppers

From LA to VA, I’m spitting lava
Been the man since goo goo gaga


Had to somehow reach my goals without hands on assistance like playing soccer


One time for
Our armada
We All each moving like the Godfather

I’m the greatest
Til i
Stand corrected like proper posture
Do all i can to see the family prosper
Batman city they know I gotham (got them)
After wildfires flowers still Blossom
I gotta Story to tell like I’m Big poppa
Kill the verse and fill it with the gospel
This is not a  game
You End up ‘dead playing’ like a possum
I
Serge n power forward like ibaka
Feeling like I’m Malcolm Mitchell up in boston

Or like
Stephen hawkings when he was walking meets 2003 Steve austin
Young Genius talking
Cut the puppet strings that the people caught in
When it’s going down they be all be  joccin
They be all rocking til the road rocky
So it's no talking, potion pouring got the cauldron popping
Win the only option


This that
432hertz
New church
Bring the pain
The
Truth hurts
No one can dim my shine

I didn't finish school first
Vonte in your
Youtube search
Verse give you the goosebumps
Just like im RL Stine



Secede (Succeed) in the south like the civil war
They know the product  that I ship is pure


I had to
Build report
Built for war
If
You take it overboard you better hope that you Drift ashore
Ok I’m
Bull headed like A
Minotaur
Had to get the money  we was
Living poor
Even now I’m
In the marshes mellowed (marshmellow) out meditating on how to get some-more (‘smore)
For a gram-crackers (graham crackers) will lock ya up
Slide on thin ice like a hockey puck
But I will not give up

Put you on game lemme sauce ya up
Run the city and we run amuck
Run amongst the wolves
You bet not stumble once
She bounce on beat she drop it make it jump....
The Landfilled with trash like a city dump
Till I came to conquer
Straight from the swamp
Young future trunks
Don’t follow prompts but
My music bump

So the labels wanna give me a
Small loan of million dollars like a donald trump's dad
Switch directions
You can’t come pass
I encompass, what they front as
Dont compare me to them they
Contrast

The bomb has already left the
Launchpad
Boom
