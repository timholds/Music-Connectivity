[Verse 1]
I wanna take a ride
I like it when you drive with me
I've got nowhere to go or show you
Just take me out of my mind
I wanna see the lights
Coming towards us with my glasses off
Soft dots drifting by in darkness
Just take me out of my mind

[Chorus]
You arrived
A soft slow end of time
Saying if all we saw were bright lights
Darkness is what we'd try to find

[Verse 2]
I wanna hear your voice
Like the trees behind this restaurant
You can see them through that roofless building
That was once somebody's home

I really like this photograph
When did you feel the pattern form?
You're starting to engulf inside me
Even when I'm not alone

[Chorus]
You arrived
A soft slow end of time
Saying if all we saw were bright lights
Darkness is what we'd try to find

[Verse 3]
Your eyes tell me I'm still alive
And no matter what else happens
It's perfect when you're right by my side

Lasso the gold
I don't own a pistol
I hope there's no time I wish that I did
Turn off the lights
And turn into crystals
Close all the roads
And don't have a fit
