Maybe she will, maybe she won't

She don't kiss on the first date (No)
She won't have sex if you don't wait (Oh, no)
I don't believe it so
I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight

She won't let you near the kit-kat (No)
She don't give head, said she ain't like that (No, no)
I've heard it all
But I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight

Lipstick, hair weaves, and toe nails
A hotel lobby full of females
And though I can't give you all the details
I still remember
Some particular shorty on a certain night
She was specifically standing over to my right
She's GHETTOFABULOUS, and I'm sure
If I tried to take her home with me she'd say

She don't kiss on the first date (No)
She won't have sex if you don't wait (Oh, no)
I don't believe it so
I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight

She won't let you near the kit-kat (No)
She don't give head, said she ain't like that (No, no)
I've heard it all
But I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight

She wants my hotel room number
To my jacuzzi suite with the mini bar
She wants to live like a superstar for just one night so
She's showing me her ta-ta's in the limousine
And then she turn around and had the nerve to say to me
She don't wanna do what she'll regret in the morning
So what am I to do?

She don't kiss on the first date (No)
She won't have sex if you don't wait (Oh, no)
I don't believe it so
I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight

She won't let you near the kit-kat (No)
She don't give head, said she ain't like that (No, no)
I've heard it all
But I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight

She don't kiss on the first date (No)
She won't have sex if you don't wait (Oh, no)
I don't believe it so
I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight

She won't let you near the kit-kat (No)
She don't give head, said she ain't like that (No, no)
I've heard it all
But I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight

Maybe she won't (Maybe I will)
Maybe she won't (Maybe I will, I will, I will)
Maybe she won't (Maybe I will)
But I know you will (I know I will)
Tell me why

She don't kiss on the first date (No)
She won't have sex if you don't wait (Oh, no)
I don't believe it so
I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight

She won't let you near the kit-kat (No)
She don't give head, said she ain't like that (No, no)
I've heard it all
But I gotta try, she don't, she won't
But maybe she will tonight
