[Verse 1: Casual]
Niggas get vexed whenever I step in
Always wanna flex so I got a weapon
Which protects me and mine
Get too bold then you're seeing nine
Milli, I rhyme silly but it really don't mean nothing
I seen thugs always want a mean mug so I bring slugs
To the party to reassure I be secure
Really don't know why they beefing for
I leave teeth in the floor like fossils, I toss flows
Just to show you, what the boss knows
I got style, to make men hostile
I shall continue, then you still lost while
Challenging in physical combat
Show me the ringleader, and the wiz'll go bomb that
I come fat, you niggas front run cease
They say bigger punks fear
But I don't hear what they say I should
And when a hood try to steal my goods
Good! I wanna show him that dreads can fly
Heads I stood my ground there's snakes around
Scheming on the deep down but I defeat clowns with intellect
Then the next flex, so I'm good to wreck brains
It takes gall to brawl with minds in chains

[Chorus: Phesto x8]
It takes gall to brawl with minds in chains

[Verse 2: Casual]
This conflict is making John sick
But men wanna fight over nothing, nonsense
Is common, and common sense is none
Niggas always wanna grab your fists and run
I try to walk down MacArthur, and talk to
Pedestrians, who got the sacks to alter my mind
And find the right one
Dug in the bushes, so I can get a tight one, it's fat
I got it, and now I need to be leaving
I believe men might get shady, even if they know me
Just because we flow the oldie wants my dough
We all know where he can go
I'm not taking no shorts from you
And you ain't taking shit from me
I ain't no punk so I hit the G
I'm throwing one-hitter quitters to drop em
You know when I'm strapped, so I shoulda of just mopped em
But nah, I'm not foolish, I keep a tool
With me, but that don't mean that I won't bust a fool's
Lip, equipped be my adjectives, cause I had to live long
In slums where chums come at you wrong
And try to get you for all your cent
Unless you're not dipped you got your defenses
On, they plot for your dough
You might catch a hot one, so be careful
I be prepared for fools

[Chorus x12]
