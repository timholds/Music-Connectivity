[Verse 1:Allure]
All alone on a Sunday morning
Outside I see the rain is falling, whoa oh
Inside I'm slowly dying
But the rain will hide my crying, crying, crying
And you...

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Don't you know my tears will burn the pillow
Set this place on fire 'cause I'm tired of your lies
All I needed was a simple "Hello"
But the traffic was so noisy that you could not hear me cry

[Chorus 1]
I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you...
You leave me so confused
Now I'm all cried out
Over you

(Ooh I'm over you, oh yeah you, yes)

[Verse 2:112]
Never wanted to see things your way, I had to go astray
Oh, why was I such a fool, baby
(Why was I such a fool) (Oh, yeah)
Now I see that the grass is greener, is it too late for me
To find my way home, how could I be so wrong?
(Leaving me all alone)

[Pre-Chorus 2:Allure & 112]
Don't you know my tears will cause an inferno
(Tears will cause an inferno baby)
Romance often fades why should I take the blame?
(Why should... why should I?)
You were the one who left me neglected
(Oh, I'm so sorry, baby)
Apology not accepted, add me to the broken hearts you've collected

[Chorus 2]
I...
I gave you all of me
How was I to know
You would weaken so easily
I...
I don't know what to do
Now I'm all cried out (I'm all cried out)
Over you

[Chorus 3]
I...
I gave you my love in vain
My body never knew such pleasure
My heart never knew such pain
And you... (Left me so confused)
Now I'm all cried out (All cried out)
Now I'm all cried out (All cried out)
Over you

[Outro:112]
Yes, I'm sorry
Please forgive me baby, oh-oh
Please forgive me
