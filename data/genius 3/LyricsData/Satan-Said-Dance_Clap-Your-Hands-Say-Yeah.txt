How did I arrive in a place like this?
Red right hand as the alligator kiss

My hair turns white and my face turns green
But my feet are still moving if you know what I mean

Satan Satan Satan Satan
Satan Satan Satan Satan
Satan said dance

He says to me to shake around
And don't stop 'til you hit the ground

And I know it is not how you thought it would be
No whips no chains just dancing dancing dancing dancing
Dancing dancing dancing dancing dancing dancing dancing
Dancing dancing dancing dancing

Satan said dance
