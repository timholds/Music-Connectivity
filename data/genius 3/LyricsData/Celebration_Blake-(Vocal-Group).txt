High above this overcrowded place
A distant blackbird flies through space
And all he does is search for love

Love is all that matters in the end
Whatever time I have to spare
Will be with you for ever more

Love is the oldest secret of the universe
Warm as the touch of two innocent lovers
When they discover that love is what
We ever really know
A past and future come and go
Because they do love stays with you

Love is all that matters in the end
Whatever time I have to spare
Will be with you for ever more

Love is the oldest secret of the universe
Warm as the touch of two innocent lovers
When they discover that love is
What we ever really know
A past and future come and go
Because they do love stays with you
