J-Lo!
Ya tu sabes, no hay más nada

It's a new J-Lo-ration
(Mr. Worldwide)
Of party people

Get on the floor, darling!
Darling, get on the floor

Let me introduce you to my party people
In the club...

I'm loose
And everybody knows I get off the train
Baby, it's the truth
I'm like Inception, I play with your brain
So don't sleep or snooze
I don't play no games so don't get it confused, no
'Cause you will lose, yeah
Now pump it up
And back it up like a Tonka truck, darling

If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak then step on the floor
If you're an animal then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor
Yeah we work on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving
Put your drinks up!

Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco
London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York
Vegas to Africa

Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
(Así me gusta)
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor

I know you got it clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rockin', rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop, keep it moving
Put your drinks up!
It's getting ill it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I ain't wrong we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco
London to Ibiza
Straight to L.A., New York
Vegas to Africa

Dance the night away
Live your life and stay young on the floor
Dance the night way
Grab somebody, drink a little more

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor

That badonka donk is like a trunk full of bass on an old
School Chevy
All I need is some vodka and some Coke
And watch get Donkey Konged
If you're ready for things to get heavy
I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me, dale
Don't believe me just vet me
My name ain't Keith but I see why you Sweat me
L.A., Miami, New York
Say no more, get on the floor!

La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon' be it on the floor
