[Hook 1]
Wishin' I could pick you up, whishin' that you could be mine
When I'm across the world, we know that could take time
Just lookin' at your pictures make me [?]
Then I pick up my phone, so I can see you on Facetime
Facetime (3x)
With me, with me, with me

[Verse 1: Rayven Justice]
I'm wishin' I could lick you up, whishin' I could take you down
I'm wishin' I could pick you up, I wanna see you right now
Every time we stop we go another round, hit you in the spot and make you make a sound like (Uhh)
Girl you got me wanting you, there's so many things that we can do
And I don't care if your friends around, 'cause if they really down then we can all get down
Makin' me horny all through the night, you'll show me yours and I'll show you mine
She put that camera up below her waistline, I'm sexin' with my baby on Facetime

[Hook 2]
Wishin' I could pick you up, whishin' that you could be mine

Just lookin' at your pictures make me [?]
Then I pick up my phone, so I can see you on Facetime

[Verse 2: JazzLazer]

Show me yours Imma show you mine, show me yours Imma you mine - Imma show you mine
Imma watch you play with it, Imma show you how to get it, Imma make you move the camera to your waistline
Okay baby okaaaay, me and my baby havin' sex over Facetime
