[Spoken Intro]
Venice, California
Known then as "Venice: Slum by the Sea"

[Verse 1]
There's no need to wear these shades when I drive
I need to see the leap before the stride
There's so much more that can happen
I'm sure that you can imagine
I live around here
Let me show you how to walk it, stop the traffic
Them two legs will get you right for action with good brain
That get you all the answers
That get you all the cash and fashion, just bat your lashes and

[Chorus]
Tell me where you wanna go
But I don't really think that it could get much better
The city I love, city I love, city I love
You tellin' me you wanna break free, I bet you never
Bet you never
Powder your nose, love
Smoke if you want to
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you girl
It's all for you
Tell me where you wanna go (It's all for you)

[Verse 2]
So when you're living the dream is it hard to see
Does your heart beat heavenly
I think it's much more than the green leaf but it helps of course
There's only one season
Can you believe the way that they talk about my paradise
We don't need that kind of vibe, no no

[Chorus]
Don't tell me where you're from girl
Tell me where you wanna get to
The city I love, city I love, city I love
You wanna break free on me, I bet you never
Bet you never
Powder your nose, love
Smoke if you want to
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you girl
It's all for you

[Outro]
Don't tell me where you're from girl
Tell me where you wanna get to
Put your feet in the water
The city belongs to you girl
It's all for you
Tell me where you wanna go (It's all for you)
