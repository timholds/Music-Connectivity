[Verse 1]
Some folks call me crazy my momma call me 'hon
And depending on the mood your in, I might be either one
Hey, I get up and I go to work and I got to work some more
When I get home I take it off and I throw it on the floor

[Chorus]
I'm a country boy and I'm a rocking roller
Like a little crown in my Coca-Cola
Say a little prayer for all the soldiers
Fighting for the USA
I never was captain of the football team
You ain't never been a prom queen
It's just us and that's ok
If I got you well it's a good day
Good day to be me

[Verse 2]
You weren't wearing makeup baby on the nigh you said we would
It's the funny things that I remember when I'm feeling good
A dollar in my pocket and a catfish on the line
A song about a simple love that's stronger than the pines

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When I see old glory waving when the music starts
I take my hat off of my head and put it on my heart

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If I got you well it's a good day, baby
Good day to be me
If I got you well it's a good day, baby
