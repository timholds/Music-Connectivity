[Chorus]
If you livin' now for Christ, and you sacrifice your life say heaven yeah
If there's no doubt about it, tear the roof off and shout it say heaven yeah (2X)
Come on God's people we fightin' for the crown, hold it down
Reppin' for Christ it's on now (4X)

[Verse 1]
Call me the river of the Nile child, silencing the foul mouth
Satan file out, with ya tools ready to wild out
Young Christian's soldiers, we spark the revolution
Cause Satan stealing lies and we demands the restitution
I shout out Jesus name cause that's my sonic solution
To evil spirits, profane lyrics and soul boosting
I coach an unbeliever till' his hardened heart loosens
Then walk him through the marathon, when Satan speaks refuse him
We press towards the goal every quarter mile re-juicing, with a
Bite of the Word, a cup full of Spirit
Then pray diligent so my Christ the King can feel it
I feel Him in my Spirit you can here it in my lyric
And when Satan here it him and his goons they fear it
Cause they all a bunch of mimics and his power got a limit
To a hold on a world cold, I'm going from concrete to streets gold
Praisin' one God that came in threefold
Let it be told, not ya everyday people
I study the scrolls and sit and pray for the sequel
The second coming, strong in my stance, ya loose like water running
Flaky like a leaf crumbling, steady ya stumbling
With the massive boulder, Christ, rock of Gibraltar
Cause when I start to lean, I rest my weight upon the alter
The Man that brought the price, the sacrifice mixed with blood and water
Makes the Lamb perfected, connected, you gotta respected it
Ya comments connected, ya wisdom detected as rhetoric
Especially when ya speak on Christ I take that subject delicate
Christian confederate, raise the flag, the blood stained rag
This be the new wine, from aged scrolls to click it and drag
Mic's I rip it in half, knowledge I pick it and bag
Fitting' my staff, with heavy armor, for the aftermath
Sometimes I have, cause I know the end of the warpath
The Lord's wrath rains on those not washed in the bloodbath

[Chorus] (4X)

[Verse 2]
Another day in the life livin' through Christ in this flesh shell
My Spirit lusts the Godly things in life, my flesh tests hell
So I excel, in written spirituals, the full Gospel to David's lyricals
In Psalms study with sweaty palms
Once was wild now I'm steady calm, walk the street with my heavy arm
The Word which is my Dillinger and Teflon
Just a creation, but through Christ received initiation
To the golden nation through worship and faithful demonstration
Much elation on my part, at 23 my life received a jumpstart
Now I'm on point like a one-guard
Or guard number one in the front line of the most divine
I'ma stand strong while other's weaken and they faith decline
Joy no cat is taken mine, faith no man is breakin' mine
The world is ending, who debate the sign, when judgment come son just wait in line
Souls for Christ I'm getting mine until it's quittin' time
And when I see him face to face, I'll spit a rhyme
About my master and king, ruler over everything
From the most complex things in life, to the songs the birds sing
To peace in projects, to when Glocks in the burbs ring
Its so confusing it's disturbing, that's what the world thinks
In the last days, fear will make the hardest heart sink
Don't worry it'll be over in a bat of an eye blink
It's critical or else I would spit it in a lyrical
Mind the spiritual, straight from the walking miracle

[Chorus] (2X)
