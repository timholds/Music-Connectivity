[Verse 1]
They wonder how we do it
They ask me if I care
They wonder how come the years
Haven't sought more lover's tear

They question that it's true
A love which never wilts
And they must seek you there
Where furies smite young slits

[Chorus]
And they must seek you there
Down in the strife
And they must seek you there
Where death outnumbers life

[Verse 2]
And they have no idea
What we do at night
And how for you and I
The hour never strikes

They wonder how we do it
They wonder how come
How come I've been doing things with you
I would never tell my mom

[Chorus]
