Knock it all down
Will this song live on long after we do?
Will this song live on?

Can I graduate?
Can I look at faces that I meet?
Can I get my punk-ass off the street
I've been living on for so long?

Can I graduate?
To the bastard talkin' down to me
Your whipping boy calamity
Cross your fingers, I'm goin' to knock it all down

Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?

Echo fadin', we can't let go
She goes walkin' by in slow-mo
Sell your heart out for a buck
Go on, fade out before I get stuck

Talkin' to somebody like you
Do you live the days you go through
Will this song live on long after we do
Can I graduate?

Can I look at faces that I meet?
Can I get my punk-ass off the street?
Won't die on the vine, I wanna knock it all down
Can I graduate?

Echo fading, candle blow
Did you flash out long ago?
Cross my fingers, I don't know
Someone poked you down below

Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?
Can I graduate?

Can I get my punk-ass off the street?
Can I look at faces that I meet?
I'm not waiting here for you to fly

Will this song live on long after we do?
Long after we do?
