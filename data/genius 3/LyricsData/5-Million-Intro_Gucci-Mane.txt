[Intro]
Metro Boomin' want some more nigga

[Chorus]
I'm just slidin' down the 'crest on a hot summer day
All these diamonds on it got me feelin' some type of way
Drop the top on these haters cuz the top in the way
And if you ain't gettin' no money then you just in the way
Took my shirt off in the vert cuz the shirt in the way
If these hoes ain't talkin' bout fuckin' then they just in the way
All these diamonds on my fist I'm feelin' some type of way
If that bitch ain't gettin' no money then that bitch in the way
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I make 5 Million a day (5 Million a day?)
Gucci Mane La Flare I make 5 Million a day (Hold up, hold up, okay)

[Verse 1]
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare, I make 5 million a day (Hol up)
Let me clarify I made 5 Million today
Nigga lookin' at my watch they feelin' some type of way
But these Niggas ain't get money man they just in the way
You got a hater mentality it's hard to relate
(Hol up) Let me clarify 20 mil out the gate
$10,000,000 mansion Gucci Mane Estate
With an all-gold Rollie, match the fork and the plate
My album dropped September but I'm booked up to May
These bitches sayin' that I'm gross cuz I skeet in they face
Why you bring your friend, babe? Man, that bitch in the way
Shit, I'm tryna fuck both of y'all, I don't like to play

[Chorus]
I'm just slidin' down the 'crest on a hot summer day
All these diamonds on it got me feelin' some type of way
Drop the top on these haters cuz the top in the way
And if you ain't gettin' no money then you just in the way
Took my shirt off in the vert cuz the shirt in the way
If these hoes ain't talkin' bout fuckin' then they just in the way
All these diamonds on my fist I'm feelin' some type of way
If that bitch ain't gettin' no money then that bitch in the way
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I make 5 Million a day (well damn, 5 Million a day?)
Gucci Mane La Flare I make 5 Million a day

[Verse 2]
I'm Gucci pretty please take your foot off these
Nigga neck let em' breathe but I just can't be
I'm too rich to give a shit 'bout anyone but me
And who gettin' cheese with me cuz that's all I see
Metro on the beat Gucci Mane got a fleet
Orange vert black rims trick-or-treat on the streets
They sent me 5 Million dollars I hadn't been out a week
And I got 5 Million niggas playa hatin' on me
Ask all the bloggers, cuz they love to write 'bout me
Then ask the mobsters, they never sold that white like me
Ask all the boppers, them bitches like to fight 'bout me
Then ask the robbers, nobody's jewelry bright like me
Guwop's a problem, nobody talks the talk like me
Guwop's a cook man, nobody holds a fork like me
These niggas liars, no money in the vault like me
I'm a supplier, nobody stops the drought like me

[Chorus]
I'm just slidin' down the 'crest on a hot summer day
All these diamonds on it got me feelin' some type of way
Drop the top on these haters cuz the top in the way
And if you ain't gettin' no money then you just in the way
Took my shirt off in the vert cuz the shirt in the way
If these hoes ain't talkin' bout fuckin' then they just in the way
All these diamonds on my fist I'm feelin' some type of way
If that bitch ain't gettin' no money then that bitch in the way
I'm Gucci Mane La Flare I make 5 Million a day (5 million a day)
Gucci Mane La Flare I make 5 Million a day
