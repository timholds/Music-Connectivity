You get on my nerves
You better start running
I found my pain
I feel it coming

Bring me my pride
Lay it on me
Feel me growing stronger
Tell me what you see

I'd love to be left alone
I'd love to be someone like god
I'd love to get in your prison
I'd love to get in your disguise

Left in my cage
Burn my believes
Uncontrolled rage
Like it's a disease
