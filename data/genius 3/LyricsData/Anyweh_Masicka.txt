[Intro:]
Di clip load, so we nuh talk loud
Send brain go pussycat cloud
How man fi say we fear dem?
Bere Crocs a walk round
What a pussycat ting, when mi run up and down man tun it inna di rass crowd
Somebody get it
Jone's Avenue

[Chorus:]
Buss my gun dem inna bwoy face
Anyweh at all
From you run up pon gunman
Head haffi go fall
What a thing when mi line up the crocks dem
Load up the gun dem
Kill bout three a dem
Pussy start fret
Same thing, feds dem waan fi call

[Verse 1:]
Spain Town buss dem head
Donâ€™t ramp wid the bloodclaat swamp a nuh blank
Pussy and copper and led
Pass mi the askella
One genna, a one genna
Dem a batty man dread
Man shot him, man watch him
Breath leave him body
Reema naw shot him and fled
Oh God, Oh God, Oh God
Tears haffi shed
Genocide, anything run up in a wi dead

Anything run up in a mi dead
Mi walk wid it
Anything run up in a mi dead
Anything run up in a mi dead
Mi claating it

[Chorus:]
Buss my gun dem in a bwoy face
Anyweh at all
From you run up pon gunman
Head haffi go fall
What a thing when mi line up the crocks dem
Load up the gun dem
Kill bout three a dem
Pussy start fret
Same thing, feds dem waan fi call

[Verse 2:]
If a shoot out, a shoot out
Wi never yet hide
When mi kill some pussy
Any man weh tek side
3 in a dem face, 3 in a dem head side
From the yeng, yeng, start a death ride
The gun a jump, fire buss yo chest wide
Yo friend a try run and him slide
Mi nuh have pity, mi have pride
Slap it in a him face, wa do some bwoy?
From mi tell the crocks Spains up
Quick wi run you down in a the street
And buss yo brains out
Common a killer dem have killer friend
Wi never chat the same road

[Chorus:]
Buss my gun dem in a bwoy face
Anyweh at all
From you run up pon gunman
Head haffi go fall
What a thing when mi line up the crocks dem
Load up the gun dem
Kill bout three a dem
Pussy start fret
Same thing, feds dem waan fi call
