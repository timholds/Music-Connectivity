Big slice, then I'm running on the next one
Swift strike to the midsection
You are not able to get a breath in
I'm destined to be the only one left so

You better call the rest in
Now this is what you call a lesson
Callin' yourself a veteran
But are you really better than a cybernetic competitor?
Better take ya medicine. You headed in the wrong direction

Steppin' into the battle. Man it's hard, but I'm not afraid
And you know I gotta go and sharpen my katana blade
Everybody here got my back 'cause I'm about to attack
And I'm makin' up for the family. The Shimade made enemies

In Overwatch I'm giving my identity
We gotta stop talon from doing a killin' spree
And anybody that wanna come and step in front of me yeah
I got the remedy, It's like Yosh

Burning all the people like toast
If you try and get into my post
'Cause I'll be like Yosh Roadhog be doing the most
But It's really hard to penetrate a ghost
Cause I'll be like Yosh

Used to be a bragger and a boaster
Now I got the dragon in the holster
Pull it out Yosh
I'll be straight taggin' all the posters
People start to panic when I'm closer
Hit 'em with a Yosh

Burning all the people like toast
If you try and get into my post
'Cause I'll be like Yosh
Doomfist be doing the most
But It's really hard to penetrate a ghost
Cause I'll be like Yosh

Used to be a bragger and a boaster
Now I got the dragon in the holster
Pull it out Yosh
I'll be straight taggin' all the posters
People start to panic when I'm closer
Lookin' over ya shoulder
It's about to get colder
You better get a soldier
'Cause if I get too close then it's over

I'm gonna wage a war, Gonna wage a war
The war inside of me! The war inside of me
I do it for you all, I will never fall
I'm lookin' for peace
All my enemies can get the Dragon blade

And I'm about to go in, I got a lot to show 'em
I am a cyber ronin, It is what I have chosen (x2)

We need a healer know what they doing
So I can start throwin' these shurikens
I'll be attackin' 'em, You should be capturin'
Till the payload is secure again

Ultimates ready now lure 'em in
If we hold steady, we're sure to win
Hanzo is older, but I am bolder
And I am much more mature then him

I say Mada Mada you better hold up
Do you got a problem followin' orders
If they started shooting in my direction
Throw up my sword and deflect 'em

I am a man, I am machine
I do what I can for the best of my team
Shimada clan, was the regime
This is my land, this is my dream

We never Cease, rally on me
They scatter and flee
We battle for peace

I'm gonna wage a war, Gonna wage a war
The war inside of me! The war inside of me
I do it for you all, I will never fall
I'm lookin' for peace
All my enemies can get the Dragon blade

I'mma get you and your mans
You never screw with the clans
I'mma leave you in a trance
Cybernetically I am enhanced

I'mma get into my stance
You are not standing a chance
I slide you up with a glance

First I'mma kill with a blade
Then I'mma chill in the shade
These shurikens will get sprayed
Deflectin' bullets and nades

Takin' your team to the grave
Ana you better behave
I'mma keep slicing for days

Burning all the people like toast
If you try and get into my post
'Cause I'll be like Yosh
Doomfist be doing the most
But It's really hard to penetrate a ghost
Cause I'll be like Yosh

Used to be a bragger and a boaster
Now I got the dragon in the holster
Pull it out Yosh
I'll be straight taggin' all the posters
People start to panic when I'm closer
Lookin' over ya shoulder

The war inside of me! The war inside of me
I do it for you all, I will never fall
I'm lookin' for peace
