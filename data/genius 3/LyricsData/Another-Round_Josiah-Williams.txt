[Sydney Jay - Hook:]
Don’t you be holding back your love
Don’t you be holding back (x2)
‘Cause in the end, you’re gonna want another round (x2)
You’re used to your heart being hurt (x2)
But I won’t

[Josiah Williams - Verse One:]
All I want is you and I, one of a kind; one heart living in one placement
Surprising love is our element, and I’m blown away with amazement
Your heart is running, I’m chasing it; I’m catching up and I’m facing it
And when it’s mine, there’s no more falling down, I’ll be placing it
In a place where it’s untouchable, I’d guard it with all I have
And when you’re standing along that edge, I’ll be there to walk that path
With you… Take my hand… Lead the way and show me destiny
Show me how you make this mold: serenity and pleasantry
Love never seems fair, but see where we can be once we get there
Past that tender and loving care
What if I told you that’s basic, and I’m a striver?
Devoting all that I have to be assigned, personal dedicated reminder
Look beyond my word’s poetic exterior
The truth laying beneath it has a much stronger superior
Then imagine that I’m speaking without a sound
Break the silence if you want another round

[Sydney Jay - Hook:]
Don’t you be holding back your love
Don’t you be holding back (x2)

[Verse Two:]
Waiting on a notice from forever (When it calls)
It tells me that there’s never “now or never (And when I fall)
She’s understanding and collected
And shows me where my pain and discomfort is directed
She gives me this feeling like I’m laying inside of a bird’s wing
Feeling calm and serene as I listen to her sing
Tell me everything that you feel through your harmonies, vocally
While I day dream of expressing about our love, globally

May I be honest? Your body’s so amazing
But it’s my heart, girl, that’s what you’re saving

Always remember why I’m here and why I’m in this
Love can be relentless, but with me? Love is endless

Remember this is our day, Valentine, show me the way
All the colors around the city light a bright red, and no grey
Slow dancing and castanets, our love is meeting Bolero
I’m taken away by cupid’s bow & arrow

[Sydney Jay - Hook:]
Don’t you be holding back your love
Don’t you be holding back (x2)
‘Cause in the end, you’re gonna want another round (x2)
You’re used to your heart being hurt (x2)
But I won’t

[Sydney Jay – Verse Three:]
No this ain’t a crush
This is real and I know it
You treat me like a queen
Royalty, never below it
You may buy me chocolates, but your love is priceless
Cause’ this feeling that I’m feeling can’t be bought or sold
Your touch sends shivers down my spine
Our futures bright down the line
In this love game two can play two will win
Living happily ever after in the end
