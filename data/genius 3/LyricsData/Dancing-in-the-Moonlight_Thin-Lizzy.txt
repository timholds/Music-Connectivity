[Verse 1]
When I passed you in the doorway
Well you took me with a glance
I should have took that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance

Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
And my father he's going crazy
He says I'm living in a trance

[Chorus]
But I'm dancing in the moonlight
Its caught me in its spotlight
Said I'm dancing in the moonlight
On this long, hot summer night

[Verse 2]
Its three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the streets again
I disobeyed another warning
I should've been in by ten

Now I won't get out until Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
Oh but it's a habit worth forming
If it means to justify the ends

[Chorus]
Dancing in the moonlight
Its caught me in its spotlight
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long, hot summer night

[Bridge]
And I'm walking home
The last bus is long gone
But I'm dancing in the moonlight

[Instrumental]

[Chorus x3]
