Let me tell you 'bout my last night in Edmonton
Matter fact my past life in Edmonton
Growin' up some niggas used to hate me cah
I was always wavy
Up and down on them fast bikes in Edmonton
Used to spend every single penny fuck a savings
Dances in Green Towers, raving in Claverings
Hype with the loud mouths
Fist fightin' at Townhouse
And now we headline at the Roundhouse
This riddim got me in a mood and a vibe
I'm just happy that a nigga made it through it with Grime
Darg I'm a poster on the 279 yeah
I set the pattern left a blueprint
Walked the path and left a shoeprint
Now they lettin' yutes sing
Songs sell from the movie from makin' music
I had to pinch myself like whos this?
Cah it can't be true
Only Edmonton niggas in (?) rooms
Cosy with the bangers and the shottas dem
Chattin' bout cris gyal?
Me and Liam ran through the lot of them
30 man deep going Eros, they tell us not again
Squash beef until we spot 'em, then it's on again
It was no thing, everybody had their own ting
That's how we used to pattern when we go (?)
Kingsmead, County, Grammar even Winchmore
Clocked we was powerful bruddas so we link more
Montague, Bounces, Town even Church Street
Get caught lackin' on there? That's the worst beef
279, the 259, the 149 you slip on there you run for your life
Everybody's certi but not certi like me tho
And yeah we all been out here but not early like Mido
A man was out here early but not early like Debo
Buying 28s and tryna work to that kilo
Thinking 'bout them days got me missin' it
Before we had to run from the feds it was races at Queen Elizabeth's
Stacey was the fastest
Seven was the hardest
N18 we used to go Xenon for the dances
Before we really was tuggin'
It was 110s, 95s, Heated and Buggin'
Got me thinking 'bout Camp again
Used to wear the TN Nike caps
The jackets with the stitching in the back of them
Little niggas doing men's beef
Back when the Green had the red seats
I used to style on niggas, put a smile on bitches
House parties over Island Village
When there was (?) gettin' bus at night
And nine niggas went to juves in the summertime
Avirex in the worst of the weathers
Before 41st got developed
Before there was a 349
Before my favourite D-boy died
Before they made the Green all nice, it was a (?)
Now it's got a JD Sports, we had the Inshops

Tell you 'bout my last night in Edmonton...my past life in Edmonton

Big up my 1-8 niggas as well
