Chorus

Let's cuddle up
I'll wrap my arms around your waist
And lie down naked by the fireplace
On a bearskin rug
We can make sweet love
And then, snuggle up
We don't need no sheets tonite
Just your body laying next to mine
Is that all right?
Lady, let's cuddle up

Verse 1

I wanna feel your body
From head to toe
Give you everything
You've been waiting on
And you won't be disappointed
Wait and see
(Oh girl)
We can make tonite
So beautiful
Make the love we share
More meaningful
As our bodies fit together
Perfectly
(Oh when we)

Repeat Chorus

Verse 2

Your eyes are telling me
Where your mind is at
And later on you know
We can handle that
So as the flames surround
Your naked silhouette
Here by the fire
(Mmm)
I'm gonna take my time
'Til I finish this
Kiss the spot on your thigh
Where you're ticklish
Exploring all the secret places
You'd want me to find
(So this time)

Repeat Chorus

Bridge
Kissing you, holding you, feeling you
Caressing you, touching you, loving you
Massing you, etc

Chorus Vamp

Counter-Chorus

I just wanna hold you
I just wanna be with you
Lying next to you
Is all I wanna do
(repeat 2X)
