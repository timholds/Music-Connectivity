KoreanHey boy, its cold

[Verse 1: Sik-K]
아직 못 잊었니 너의 EX
Tho I give you better sex
다 티나는데 너는 왜 아닌 채해
난 화내려고 그러는게 아닌데 yeah
나한테 분명히 있어 책임이
너가 얘기할 때 눈치챘지 이미
너무 솔직한게 우리 죄인가봐
다시 얘기할까 조금만 이따가
묻어있어 너의 두 눈엔
못 본 척하게 수습해
이제 걔가 나보다 잘했는지 궁금해
그럼 너는 돌리지 이 이야길 다른주제로

[Hook: Sik-K]
Stop thinkin about your ex
내가 옆에 있는데
왜 또 생각하니 걜
넌 뭐야
Can you stop thinkin about your ex
I'm gonna love you till the a.m
내가 뭐라고해
No it’s okay
걱정 안해도돼
내가 더 잘해줄게
내가 뭐라고해
No it’s okay
걱정 안해도돼
내가 더 잘해줄게
Woo woo woo

[Verse 2: Cha Cha Malone]
Oh girl, you’re playin’
No I don’t buy it
Got you runnin’, running’ back
When you’re feelin’ bad
Oh no, you tried it
But i’m out here globetrottin’
I could pay no mind
And when you text, i’m silent
Best believe i’m fine
He keeps sending messages
He gettin’ to your head
Do you call him? You must call him
Why are you up in my bed?
You’re so childish, you be wildin’
But you right it real good
Yeah you ride it real good
That’s why I can’t let you go girl
I just need it slow girl
Grindin’ on your body, do it all to you
And you know I put it down girl
But you need to block him out girl
Why can’t you just let him go?

English TranslationAre you still not over your ex?
Tho I give you better sex
It’s so obvious but why’re you acting like you’re not?
I’m not trying to be mad
But I clearly have responsibilities
When you talked to me, I already noticed
I guess being too honest is our sin
Let’s talk again later

It’s there in your eyes
Fix it so I can act like I didn’t see
I’m curious if he was better than me last night
Then you change the subject

Stop thinkin about your ex
I’m right next to you
But why you thinking about him again?
What are you doing?
Can you stop thinkin about your ex
I’m gonna love you till the a.m

What can I say?
No it’s okay
No need to worry
I’ll treat you better
