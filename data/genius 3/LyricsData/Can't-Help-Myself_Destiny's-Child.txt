[Verse: LaTavia]
Never lost that feeling
Once I got that feeling for you I knew
That there was something special
You had a certain sparkle bout you
It's true

[Verse: LeToya]
I cannot be more sincere
Boy whenever you are near
I just lose my mind, I get weak inside
Swear I can do anything, yeah and I

[Chorus:]
I can't help myself
I'm in love with you and nobody else
It's real as hell
And I can't deny it's how I feel

[Verse: Beyonce]
Never did stop falling
Once you started calling for me
So deep
Living in denial
Couldn't see what you saw in me
Ooooh, baby, baby, now I

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly]
I can see it all so clear
I have nothing left to fear
With you by my side
Ain't no need to hide
I can tell you anything

[Chorus:]
I can't help myself
I'm in love with you and nobody else
It's real as hell
And I can't deny it's how I feel

[Guitar Break:]
Feel... feel... feel
I (I can't help myself)
Can't help (I can't help myself)
Myself (Oooh)
Ooh, baby, baby now I

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly]
I can see it all so clear
I have nothing left to fear
With you by my side
Ain't no need to hide
I can tell you anything

[Chorus:]
I can't help myself
I'm in love with you and nobody else
It's real as hell
And I can't deny it's how I feel
