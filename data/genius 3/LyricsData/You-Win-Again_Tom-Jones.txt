The news is out all over town
That you've been seen out runnin' 'round
I know that I should leave but then
I just can't go, you win again

This heart of mine could never see
What everybody knows but me

Just trustin' you was my great sin
(Ya gotta trust in me, baby)
What can I do? You win again

This heart of mine, oh, I could never see
What everybody knows but me

Just trustin' you was my great sin
(Just trustin' you, that was my great sin)
What can I do? You win again
