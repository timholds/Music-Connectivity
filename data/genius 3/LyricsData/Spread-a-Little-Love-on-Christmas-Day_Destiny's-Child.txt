It's beautiful outside and the wind is whistling
I look outside my window as I see my neighbor's Christmas tree
The snow is falling, my spirit's feeling happy
I'm feeling even better 'cause I got my family next to me

I gotta thank my Lord (thank you, Lord)
Thanks for what I have (thanks for what I got)
I couldn't ask for more (wouldn't ask for more)
God I am so glad (Thanks for what I got)

Some think I am blessed (just because of the)
Amount written on my check (not because of the)
Amount of my happiness (is the reason)
Why I am so blessed (so I'm gonna)

Having me a Merry Christmas
Feliz Navidad
And having me a Merry Kwanzaa
Happy Hanukkah

Spread a little love on Christmas day
Spread a little love on Christmas day
Spread a little love on Christmas day
Spread a little love on Christmas day
Spread a little love on Christmas day
Spread a little love on Christmas day
Spread a little love on Christmas day
Spread a little love on Christmas day

Somewhere high up in the sky, my Santa Clause is coming
With Donner, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen, Cupid, Randolph, Comet
He's bringing goodies, to the ghettos and the hoodies
The mansions and suburban places and apartment kiddies

Representing Houston, Texas
ATL, Illinois ladies
Chillin' with Rosie O'Donnell
Having a good time we clownin'

Some think I am blessed (just because of the)
Amount written on my check (not because of the)
Amount of my happiness (is the reason)
Why I am so blessed (so I'm gonna)

Having me a Merry Christmas
Feliz Navidad
And having me a Merry Kwanzaa
Happy Hanukkah

Do you have my back on Christmas day?
Yes, I got your back on Christmas day!
Do you have my back on Christmas day?
Girl, I got your back on Christmas day!

You got my back? (I got your back)
You got my back? (I got your back)
You got my back? (I got your back)

Listen

My youngsters, teenagers, my Mommas, my Poppas
My sisters, my brothers, Grandmothers, Grandfathers
My uncles, my aunties, my nephews, my nieces
I hope you, I hope you ready for the season
And I hope you heard one thing I had to say
Laugh, love, care, share, bring peace and pray
Bring lots of happiness and joy to someone's day
We're gonna spread a little love on Christmas Day
