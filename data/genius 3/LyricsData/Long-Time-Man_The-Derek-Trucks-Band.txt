Make a long time man feel bad
Make a long time man feel bad
Yes the worst old feeling that I ever had
When I can't get a letter from home

My mother won't write for me
My mother won't write for me
Won't write no letter, won't send a word
Make a long time man fee bad

Yeah Berta, d'you cry 'bout a dime
Berta, would you cry 'bout a dime
If you cry 'bout a nickel, you die 'bout a dime
Make a long time man feel bad

Make a long time man feel bad
Make a long time man feel bad
It's the worst old feeling that I ever had
Make a long time man feel bad

Make a long time man feel bad
It makes a long time man feel bad
So bad, so bad, so bad, so bad
Oh, so bad
Mmm, so bad
