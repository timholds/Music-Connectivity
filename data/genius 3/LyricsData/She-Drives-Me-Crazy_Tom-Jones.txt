I can't help the way I feel
Things you do don't seem so real
Tell me what you got in mind
'Cause we're runnin' out of time
Won't you ever set me free
This waitin' 'round is killin' me

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself

I can't get any rest
People say I'm obsessed
Everything you say is lies
But to me there's no surprise
What I have, I knew was true
Things go wrong, they always do

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself, no

She drives me crazy
Like no one else

I won't make it on my own
No one likes to be alone

She drives me crazy
Like no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
I can't help myself

She drives me crazy
Drives me crazy
Like no one else
You know she drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
Oh myself

She drives me crazy, oh yes
Like no one else, no one else
She drives me crazy
And I can't help myself
