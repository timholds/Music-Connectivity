Cry now, cry later, as bad as it is
Tomorrow it will only be worse
A new tragedy on every page
Losing heart from all the hurt

Apathetic youth without a way in this world
Opportunity has gone extinct
Not just for minorities, illegals
It's the hopeless majority that rules nothing

Pessimism, pestilence
It's poverty or jail
How can you eat tomorrow
When you can't even find work today?

Homeless, hopeless
Starving and scared
There's nowhere to turn
When no one seems to care

On and on and on
It's all gone
So hopelessly
Hopelessly wrong

On and on and on
Until we're all
Dead and gone
And forgotten
