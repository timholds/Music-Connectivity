[Verse 1: Quasimoto]
Quasimoto representing the unseen
Immortal stats yo we got invisible clean
Advanced rhyme scene out of lou beans
The unseen we keep it clean like a diamond ring
Or dirty like a one night fling
But i bet you can't catch my swing
We roll numbers stack styles every time we do our thing
Hitting like some line backers
Rude rhyme shacklers you fuck with us you end up on the black list
You rushed by tacklers yeah thats a fat kiss of death
Like we on the street scene
You and your whole crew intrigued cause you ain't got no tricks up your sleeve
Only bust rhyme function to a point to where yall can't even breathe
So make way for the unseen

[Verse 2: Quasimoto]
I got soul like Fred Wesley
You know it's lord quas up in the spot hitting freshly
Who blow ya head while im keeping my cool
Madlib controlling tracks taking yall back to school
We got yall up on the bubblegum
Smack you like im troublesome
Turn your speakers up take a puff and you'll see exactly what I mean
Loud and clear be the unseen
