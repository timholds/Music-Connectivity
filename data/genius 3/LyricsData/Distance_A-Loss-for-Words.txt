I've been dreaming of your face
I see it clearer still eight thousand miles away
And even as the seasons change
There's always one thing that remains
I know this image of you will never start to fade
Never start to fade
If you find yourself alone I hope you know I'm by your side
If you're scared you're losing hope, just hang on til I arrive
Because I know what we both know that whatever distance I might go
Whatever distance I might go, I'm only one phone call from home
So don't forget or second guess
That all these nights you've never slept
That every night after I left
Your name was on my breath
I know it's hard to be this far
Feels like we're half a world apart
It's the challenges we face
That make us who we are
That makes us what we are
You will always, you will always have my heart
