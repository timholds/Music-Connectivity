[Verse 1: Young M.A.]
Growing up I had a little sister, older brother
And for us a father figure was a single mother
My daddy was locked up, my mother was knocked up
And every now and then my brother's father would pop up
But I considered him dad
Because he would give me basically anything that I asked
Fresh kicks for the summer, I would crease 'em and scuff 'em
Goose coat for the winter with a new pair of butters (Ooouuu)
He treated me like I was his
A single mother, no daddy, that's just how we lived
We didn't understand cuz we was just kids
A blended family, at times that's just what it is
That's just what it is

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Hey I might not really be your mother
That don't mean that I don't really love ya
And even though I married your father
That's not the only reason I'm here for ya

[Pre-Hook: Alicia Keys]
I think you're beautiful
I think you're perfect
I know how hard it gets
But I swear it's worth it, worth it

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
'cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family, but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love, love

[Verse 3: Alicia Keys]
I know it started with a little drama
I hate you had to read it in the paper
But everything's alright with me and ya Mama
Baby everybody here you know adores ya

[Pre-Hook: Alicia Keys]
I think it's beautiful
I think its perfect
I know how hard it gets
But I swear it's worth it, worth it

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
'cause there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family, but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love, love

[Bridge: Alicia Keys]
For love, for love
Are you this real my true love
Cause you're my baby, rejoice daily
I believe love could bring us closer than blood

[Hook: Alicia Keys]
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love
There ain't nothing, there ain't nothing, there ain't nothing
There ain't nothing I won't do for us
It may not be easy
This blended family but baby
That's what you do, what you do, what you do
What you do for love

[Outro: Alicia Keys]
That's just what you do (for love)
For love of the babies (for love)
We're a blended family (for love)
And it's alright (for love)
Said it's alright!
I'll be here forever
