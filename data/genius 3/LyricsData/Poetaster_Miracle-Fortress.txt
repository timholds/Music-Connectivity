Mother free me

They beat my body blue

Bloody

So boldly take me up to you

I'm in no shape

To share my point of view

Maybe failing's

The first thing i can do

Devil, Angel

Anyone you are

Place me safely

Somwhere very far

They came ably

To take me to the end

Faced me, chased me

Made my courage bend

I know, always

We're on different trains

Someday meet me

See me here again

Undo errors they left behind my teeth

Undo these errors they left behind my teeth
