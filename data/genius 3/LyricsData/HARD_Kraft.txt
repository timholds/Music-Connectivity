[Verse 1]
Feeling really high but I don’t even smoke
Face is white like the labelled light Coke
Feeling really high but I don’t drink lean
Minds all messed I don’t know what it means
Feeling like a Queen, but looking like a King
Lingo lacking, novice at this rap thing
I keep on slacking, on my nap time
Versace sofa is soft and sublime
Outta my mind, wake up in my car
Rolling all my notes, I light a Cigar
Cost 6 euros, for fake Ray Bans
No fucks given, stay buzzing like Mann
50 pence pieces stacked to the ceiling
Paid your bitch in change and now she kneeling
See a victim, grab my mask and my gun
Shit there’s police, you know I gotta run

[Verse 2: Kraft]
With the fam, we partied at the bay
Don’t remember much, felt fresh yesterday
Woke up feeling down, then I make my way
To my town this and the clique waits
I prayed on Sunday, it made me feel safe
Need some guidance to get my head place
Ancestors turning in their graves
They watch me misbehave
As I surf on golden waves
I am spitting now
First row is wet
Make this a show the ladies won’t forget
Bright lights all up on the stage
So much footage at such young age
End of the night, I'm the killing shadow
Dark hollow, followed cuz I’m bad, yo
Shit, I been too slow, no time for fun
Sup Taxi, can I borrow your gun?

[Verse 3: Kraft]
They treat us like Terrorists, bombing their plane
Cos they crossing my lane, I'm losing all faith
Tryna make a Million to put em in place
They broke like Mase jaw, what a disgrace
They hiding, lurking Ghostface in the mist
Damn it, fuck this, I just can't resist
Gotta tell em not to mess - I am HARD
Old school bitches on their VCR
Fast forward, speed with my license card
Cruising past your front yard, supreme black car
Hating with less than 2 Chainz makes me say "Yuck!"
I spare your life then you know you got good luck
Agree to this offer or your day is gonna suck
Give me your bad bitch, you know she wants to fuck
Double tongued, in Germany we say: "Fick!"
HARD - as my dick, HARD - that's my clique!
