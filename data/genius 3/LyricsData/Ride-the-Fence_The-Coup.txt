Yeah
Uh-huh
Yeah
That's right
Gotta get off the phone, bust this verse
Aight
Okay

I'm anti-imperial
Anti-trust
Anti-gun if the shit won't bust
Anti-corporate, they anti-my essence
Anti-snortin' them anti-depressants
But I'm not pro-poppin' em
I'm provocative
And pro-stoppin' them FBI operatives
Who professional at Black Man Pounce
And hand you a sentence that you can't pronounce
I'm also anti-narco, anti-vice
911 marks the anti-christ
They anti-social, pointin' M-16's
Guess I'm anti-the-anti-nigga-machine
Proletarian, funkadelicparliamentarian
Pro-revolt-in-the-21st-centurian
Pro-running up in Congress sayin' "fuck it all!"
But bring the people with you, that's the protocol
This beat is joyful like jailbreaks
The whole world is anti-United Snakes
So check it out, anticipate the anti-venom
And move your antibodies to this revolution rhythm
We goin' be fuckin' with 'em
Pro-union but most lost they bite
Anti-muthafuckas-crossin' a strike
Take a look around and be for or against
But you can't do shit if you ridin' the fence

Ride the fence
Now you don't really wanna
Ride the fence
Now do you really wanna
Ride the fence?
Why would you really wanna
Ride the fence
Don't ride the fence
Ride the fence
Now you don't really wanna
Ride the fence
Now do you really wanna
Ride the fence?
Why would you really wanna
Ride the fence
Don't ride the fence

I'm anti-uppin'-your-dollars-with-telekinesis
(I done tried everyday, and that shit decreases)
Anti-them-anti-crime-bill-pieces
We need cash and that's the anti-thesis
I'm pro-overthrow of the "Hip-Hop Nation"
Pro-layin'-low-til-I'm-off-probation
Pro-people's-control-of-the-cash-and-corporations
Pro-prophylactic yet pro-creation
Anti-watered-down-drinks-in-fancy-cups
Anti-promoters-who-don't-ante-up
But I'm not anti-thug
I know that power is the most effective anti-drug
I'm pro-Zapatista
Pro-Cuba
Viva!
Pro-la raza sayin' "fuck la migra!"
Policia se asesina
Lemme show you what I mean
I'm anti-republican and democratic
If they self-destruct
That's anti-climactic
Tired of bein' hunted like an antelope
Take the system by the throat
That's the antidote
So I pose a proposition
Take a look, be in support or opposition
Then be proactive proceed with confidence
Cause you know that you can't change shit by ridin' the fence

Ride the fence
Now you don't really wanna
Ride the fence
Now do you really wanna
Ride the fence?
Why would you really wanna
Ride the fence
Don't ride the fence
Ride the fence
Now you don't really wanna
Ride the fence
Now do you really wanna
Ride the fence?
Why would you really wanna
Ride the fence
Don't ride the fence
