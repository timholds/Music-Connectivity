There weren't no rhymin' at the beginning right there

Ahh yeah, I'm just gonna bring them in like an introduction
I gotcha, I gotcha super Mario. Mario... Mario

Ahhhhright y'all, comin' to you with full force
Yo, I'm not on the sauce
But we gonna do it a little something like this

Never trust a HAL-9000
When it comes to fire, I'm dousin'
Pick up your mic and start joustin'
Prayin' mantis style, not Shaolin

I don't want the capers, I'm frownin'
Order in vegertarian shark's fin
Throwin' chrome-domes in a tail spin
'Cause I don't drink scotch and I don't drink gin

When it comes to books with rhymes within
Packed like sardines in a tin
Tight-ass parties I'm roustin'
Karate-chop some round-housin'

Ahh, that was Mario's fault!
