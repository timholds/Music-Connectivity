[Intro:]
Welcome the new kid, hello the new hustler
Ever since my birth, I've been the same hustler
I twist the streets up with every flow I split
Twist they mind-frame up, that's every ho I get

[Hook:]
Hey I'm ride with the Chevy (?) wood grain grippin'
They gone hate though, they gone hate though
I got the purp and the yak, and my rims still spinnin'
They gone hate though, they gone hate though
I got my stacks on deck and the K gone blow
They gone hate though, they gone hate though
I'm 'bout the flyest nigga comin' out the slum with the flow
They gone hate though, they gone hate though

[Verse 1:]
Welcome the new kid, hello the new hustler
Ever since my birth, I've been the same hustler
I'm from that 'sippi land, hell yea they know me
I'm from that Red-Line aka 3-0-B
That's where them G hang in the dirty-dirty
The folk can't clean it up so we call it dirty-thirty
I push to pacify these hoes cause they talk too much
I keep my business to my self cause niggas talk too much
They just hate to see a street nigga doing great
Feel like they obligated to snatch some cheese right off the plate
But I ain't trippin' though, just don't stick your hands in mine
If I'm the folk, then you the skater, I destroy your grind
Make it happen K, that's what they tellin' me
I'm like that 9-11, nobody expected me
And my clique too, the whole state of 'sippi
They relate to my swagger, so they ride with me

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I twist the streets up with every flow I split
Twist they mind-frame up, that's every ho I get
Like them - yea, yea, I talk shit on the track
Niggas mad cause I won't let 'em get on the track
They ain't beefin' though, cause they ain't done for
Knowin' if they want the crown, I'm the one to come for
Yea, man, I'm gung-ho, if you gotta problem with it
I don't call problems cause I solve 'em, get it?
I'm the target of every rapper spittin' flow (?)
I'm the first pick to blow, dog, and they know this
Why it ain't hard to see, greatness is apart of me
Writing tracks and making beats, cause royalties belong to kings
And I want to see (?) off whatever I drop
And I wanna see mills dog, whenever I pop
And I'm one of these niggas now that I'm takin' the top
So, I'm tellin' these niggas now that they destined to flop

[Hook:]

[Verse 3:]
They know me from the hood that I ride in
White T, fitted cap, Louie on the side of my kicks
You can catch me in the hood with my folk boy
That consists of pimps, real niggas, and them dope boys
Be at the 'sip or A, I can keep it poppin' nigga
Krizzle on the track so the whole hood jockin' nigga
Hey I could tell by they eyes that they wanna (?)
I'm 18 but they know that I'm movin' shit
Pray they producer known in this music shit
Who else young as the K even doin' this?
Break bread with my niggas that ride
I got a state full of niggas and they ready to die
So, we can take it to the pistol place (?) shawty
Really ain't shit till the killer K shawty
I make it happen if I got around here
Cause niggas main focus - making dollars 'round here

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]
I did the same hustle
I did the same hustle

[Hook:]
