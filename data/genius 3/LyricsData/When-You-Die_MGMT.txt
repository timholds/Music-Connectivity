[Verse 1]
I'm not that nice
I'm mean and I'm evil
Don't call me nice
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I've got some work to do
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my lid off

[Verse 2]
Go fuck yourself
You heard me right
Don't call me nice again
Don't you have somewhere to be at seven thirty?
Baby, I'm ready, I'm ready, ready, ready to blow my brains out

[Chorus 1]
You die
And words won't do anything
It's permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die

[Chrous 2]
Words won't do anything
It's permanently night
And I won't feel anything
We'll all be laughing with you when you die

[Verse 3]
Go fuck yourself
I'm mean, not nice
You said it twice
You said it twice
Don't you have somewhere to be at seven thirty?

[Interlude]
I've got some work to do
I'm gonna eat your heart out
I heard you the first time
