You're driving me crazy
It's something I can't explain
Whatever you're doing to me
Why don't you do it again
I've never been so in love
Must've been sent from above
To fill my empty nights
Make everything alright
Your love is too good for words

[Chorus:]
Mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm
Your love is everything

If I could imagine
The perfect man
It would be you
You bring out the woman in me
With everything that you do

I've never been so alive
Where have you been all my life
I love the way it feels
To have a man that's real
I'm so happy inside

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Anything you want from me
I will give you what you need
Just say the word
And its done
I know you're the one
Your kiss is like a drug to me
Love the way you're touching me
I'm addicted to you
And that thing that you do

[Chorus]
