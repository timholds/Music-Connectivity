I can't win, I can't wait
I will never win this game
Without you
Without you

I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you
Without you

I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by
Without you
Without you

I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I
Without you
Without you

Oh, oh, oh
You, you, you
Without
You, you, you
Without you

Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we're estranged
Without you
Without you

I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you
Without you

I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here, I'm paralyzed
Without you
Without you

I can't look, I'm so blind
I lost my heart, I lost my mind
Without you
Without you

Oh, oh, oh
You, you, you
Without
You, you, you
Without you

I am lost, I am vain
I will never be the same
Without you
Without you

Without you
