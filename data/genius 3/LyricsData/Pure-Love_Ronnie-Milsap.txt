Pure love, baby it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Krunch and you in the mornin'
Pure love, baby it's pure love
Ninety nine and forty four one hundreds percent pure love

I wake up with sunshine
(Sunshine)
Layin' beside me
And bluebirds singin' right outside my window
Soft warm kisses
(Kisses)
Say good mornin'
Then I get breakfast in bed you know you make me so happy
(Make me so happy)

With pure love, baby it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Krunch and you in the mornin'
Pure love baby you're the picture of pure love
Ninety nine and forty four one hundreds percent pure love

Pure love, baby it's pure love
Milk and honey and Captain Krunch and you in the mornin'
Pure love, you're the picture of pure love
Ninety nine and forty four one hundreds percent pure love

Ninety nine and forty four one hundreds percent pure love
Ninety nine and forty four one hundreds percent pure love
