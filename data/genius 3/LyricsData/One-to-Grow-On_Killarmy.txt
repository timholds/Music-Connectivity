[Intro: 4th Disciple]
Here we is boy, boy, boy, boy..
Got somethin for y'all
I want all y'all to sing this shit
This some simple shit for y'all
ShoGun, come on, follow me now
Follow me now, so..

[4th Disciple]
Dumpety dumpety dump dump dumpety dump dump
Listen to 4th D flow
Dumpety dump dump dumpety dump dump
I came to show what I know
Dumpety dump dump dumpety dump dump
Listen to all my niggas go
We gon' flow
Dumpety dump dump
We came to show what we know

[Chorus: 4th Disciple]
Yo, yo, here's one to grow on
Here's one to grow on
Yo, one for y'all to grow on
Yo, yo, here's one to grow on

[4th Disciple]
Come on, come on..
Eh-yo, we all in and out
The thought was formulated from 4-packs of Stout
Can we win this war? No doubt
We got karma pourin out from the neck of the dark crystal spouts
We no more notes droughts, we came to show out
And let you all know what it's about, when I pull out
My sound was crafted in grandma's house
In a deep dark basement is where we smoke out

[Beretta 9]
Yo, into the mental, check what we been through
Still goin through it y'all, +Heaven & Hell+
Bitin my nail, it +Seems it Never Fails+
Stressed, just might hit up this mic, yo
Wild the fuck out, but
Duty for biz, niggas don't tempt me
Cuz I make it a song and beat ya ass to it
We just VH1 in it, ain't no fun in it
A group's got a big asshole, I got a gun in it
Life in a bottle, dippin out of lanes, full throttle
What's up with that nigga B9 yo?
It's called hunger pains, still hoppin the train
Findin out what's wrong, nothin, tryin to maintain
This lion ready to break down and start cryin
Ready to take the iron and start firin
Every time I hear a siren
Pimp this cuz you know we be admirin
Cuz what I be and what I do, duke only if you knew
What you knew?

[War movie sample]
Feelin the pressure, Captain?
Yes, sir!
I like you, Captain
And I just wanted to let you know
Well, uh, we're in this thing together
Alright?
You keep pressin in land until you reach Orion
I'll catch up with you there
It's all yours, Captain
GANG WAY!
{*automatic machine guns firing*}
Keep movin, come, keep movin
FUCK!
What the fuck? Come on, keep movin
Come on, come on..
