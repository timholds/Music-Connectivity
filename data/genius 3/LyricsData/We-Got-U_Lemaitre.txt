[Chorus]
If you need something to brighten up your night
And make you feel alright
You know we got you, you know we got you
If you need something, you feel it in your soul
You need something to let it all go
You know we got you, you know we got you

[Break]

[Chorus]
If you need something to brighten up your night
And make you feel alright
You know we got you, you know we got you
If you need something, you feel it in your soul
You need something to let it all go
You know we got you, you know we got you

[Break]

[Chorus - Short]
You know we got you, you know we got you
If you need something, if you need something

[Bridge]
You know we got you
Don't you know we got you
You know we got you
Don't you know we got you
Don't you know we got you
You know we got you
Don't you know we got you

[Chorus]
If you need something to brighten up your night
To make you feel alright
You know we got you, you know we got you
If you need something, you feel it in your soul
You need something to let it all go
You know we got you, you know we got you
You know we got you, you know we got you

[Outro]
You know we got you
Don't you know we got you
We know we got you
You know we got you
Don't you know we got you
We know we got you
Don't you know we got you?
