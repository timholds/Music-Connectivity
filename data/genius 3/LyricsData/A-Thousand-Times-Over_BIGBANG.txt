When I was just a little boy

Before my heart grew this cold

I didn’t know you

And you lived somewhere else

But he’s the one who fell in love

I’m someone else from down below

I get the job done

But you’re my baby, my baby

Still a diamond in the rough

I know you’ll break my heart again

Again and again

Just to know if I love you

But just when I thought I’d let you go

Settling in for the final blow

Look who changed his mind

When he thought about it

Like a pen run out of ink

And a coat that won’t quite fit

We just go on

We don’t think about that

Baby, you’re my baby

Still a diamond in the rough

Can’t you hear your own heart pound

When stand in angels come around

Can’t you see why they love you

So let your hammers ring

And get insight in the things

That we celebrate

Like a book that makes us sweat

Words we catch like fish in nets

Go on, don’t think about it

Baby, you’re my baby

Still a diamond in the rough

I know you’ll break my heart again

And again and again

Just to see if I love you
