[Intro]
Move

[Verse 1]
This man, this dutiful man has got this sense of devotion
One look, one touch of a hand can set the spiral in motion

[Pre-Chorus]
I want it, can't have it
Oh, I can hardly stand it
Oh, what's a man to do?

[Chorus]
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Na na na na na na na now
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Na na na na na na na now

[Verse 2]
This girl, this beautiful girl with eyes the size of the ocean
This man, this dutiful man has got these mixed up emotions

[Pre-Chorus]
I want it, can't have it
Oh, I can hardly stand it
Oh, what's a man to do?

[Chorus]
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Na na na na na na na now
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Na na na na na na na now

[Bridge]
Head, shoulders, knees, toes
Look alive it's time to go
Head, shoulders, knees, toes
Look alive it's time to go
Head, shoulders, knees, toes
Look alive it's time to go
Head, shoulders, knees, toes
Look alive it's time to go

[Chorus]
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Gotta get up, I gotta get up
Move
Na na na na na na na now
Gotta get up, I gotta get up

Gotta get up, I gotta get up

Gotta get up, I gotta get up
