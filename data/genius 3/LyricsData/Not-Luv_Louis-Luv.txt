Maybe I'm not good for you
Tell yourself I'm good for you
Do you really love me?
Please tell me you love me
Writing all these sad songs
Cause I don't got a mask on
You should really tell me
What you think about me

I know at times I'm losing you
I just want to come through to you
If I don't say nothing
[?] yeah
Hate going insane
I wanna make a change
Can you [?] someday?
We'll make it to our graves
Can you take my hand and pray?
I don't wanna go away
But that's fine for you to wait
That's fine for you to wait
If you can't then I will [?]
Promise one day we'll be straight
One day we'll be straight
Promise one day we'll be straight

Maybe I'm not good for you
Yeah, yeah
Tell yourself I'm good for you
Yeah, yeah
Maybe I'm not good for you
Yeah, yeah
Tell yourself I'm good for you
Yeah, yeah
Maybe I'm not good for you
Yeah, yeah
Tell yourself I'm good for you
Yeah, yeah

That's not love, that's not love
Trying to tell you shawty
That's not love, yeah
I just needed time, I still need some time
Cause I know it doesn't help to think about you every night
So if I just took some more time, would I still be on your mind
Well tell me cause I'm dying to know
And time won't slow down
Would you still be around for me?
Like would you still be down for me?
And I don't know if I'll ever know
That's not love, that's not love
Trying to tell you shawty
That's not love
Well that's not love, that's not love
Trying to tell you shawty
That's not love, ooh-ooh
That's not love, no
It's not love, no
