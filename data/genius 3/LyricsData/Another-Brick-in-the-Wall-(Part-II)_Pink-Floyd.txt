[Verse: Roger Waters & David Gilmour]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey!
Teacher, leave them kids alone!
All in all it's just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Verse: Kid Chorus]
We don't need no education
We don't need no thought control
No dark sarcasm in the classroom
Teachers leave them kids alone
Hey!
Teacher, leave us kids alone!
All in all you're just another brick in the wall
All in all you're just another brick in the wall

[Outro: Roger Waters]
Wrong! Do it again!
If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding!
How can you have any pudding if you don't eat your meat?
You! Yes! You behind the bike sheds! Stand still laddie!
