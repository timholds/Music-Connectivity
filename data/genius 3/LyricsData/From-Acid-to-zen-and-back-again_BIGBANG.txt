Just knowing mindblowing
I'm astonished by the things you say
Your genius gone delirious
Cracking me up the things you say
But in my mind I fall behind
I feel it all but love
But in my mind I'm not so kind
I only feel your sadness
And I can't get through
I can't get through to you
So here we are but no cigar
Idiots and electric guitars
You're hiding, keep riding
From acid to zen and back again
But in my mind I fall behind
I feel it all but love
But in my mind I'm not so kind
I can only feel your sadness
And I can't get through
I can't get through to you
And I can't get through
I can't get through to you
And I can't get through
I can't get through to you
