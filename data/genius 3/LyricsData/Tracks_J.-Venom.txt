[Verse 1]
Trackmarks like medals on my arms
Bitch I'm no star but I ain't trying that hard
On some dope-fiend shit, bitch yup thats my future
Fuck snortin' dope son, I'm motherfuckin' shooting
Sick and tired of hiding how I feel so
I guess I better try an fuckin' keep it real yo
I hate life, man fuck me an fuck you
Put on a smile just try to get through
My motherfucking day without bangin' up
Or slicing my wrists to the motherfuckin' stump
Feel so empty ima' bitch an spit putrid
An emo rapper? man that's fuckin' stupid
Cause numb, yeah, that's the word to describe me
Numb my world from blue to gray and become free
I'll shoot dope till I can't breathe
I'll Shoot dope till I'm not fuckin' lonely
Still kickin' back In the back of a black Cadillac
Don't give a fuck what you think jack
Now I'm taking it back with a little 40 gat
To sell it up to silk or smooth for a little hit of smack
I can't stand motherfuckin' waiting
Call em back an see if he'll take a Playstation
Alright cool, now which gas station?
Feels like I've lost any motherfuckin' sense of patience
My heart sinks when I get the voice mail
Man it feels like they'll never come through and I'll never get well
But then they text back and my heart swells
Now if they'd just hurry the fuck up, I could escape hell
