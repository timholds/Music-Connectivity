[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus]
You tucked me in, turned out the light
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
Had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back
You had to do it all alone
Make a living, make a home
Must have been as hard as it could been
And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus + Billy Ray Cyrus]
Caterpillar in the tree
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far, but you can always dream
Wish you may, and wish you might
Don't you worry, hold on tight
I promise you there will come a day
Butterfly fly away

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus + Billy Ray Cyrus + Both]
Butterfly fly away (butterfly fly away)
Got your wings, now you can't stay
Take those dreams and make them all come true
Butterfly fly away (butterfly fly away)
You've been waiting for this day
All along you've known just what to do

[Outro: Both]
Butterfly, butterfly, butterfly, butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away
Butterfly fly away
