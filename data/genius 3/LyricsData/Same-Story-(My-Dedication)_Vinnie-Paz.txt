[Intro]
They say that things just cannot grow
Beneath the winter snow
So I have been told

[Verse 1]
You came into my mother’s life at the right time
More than a step-father, more of like a lifeline
She ain’t really had happiness since my pop died
She was living but living is always not alive
And my momma should be treated like a queen
You gave her everything she ever needed like a queen
Probably the most gentle G I ever seen
The love y’all shared I never seen in human beings
Y’all were together twelve years, never no fights
Not even a little argument. That was so nice
Three of us eating dinner together most nights
Working seven days a week. That ain’t no life
But never once did I hear you complain
Even when they let you go never hear you with blame
It take a real man to walk through the rain
He was a real man who got sick and fought through the pain

[Hook: Liz Fullerton]
I am made of all four corners
All directions without the borders
I am strung so loose together
And you're a thread that holds forever
I'm not nobody's baby
You had your shit too
But you always came through for me

[Verse 2]
I walked in that morning and knew something was wrong
I tried to talk to you, Rock. You didn’t respond
I called 9-1-1 and then ran for my moms
Waiting for the ambulance and I tried to be calm
Moms went with you. I stayed and held down the fort
I was nervous. I was crying and really distraught
I was alone by myself, just left with my thoughts
Mommy called. Told me that you had a stroke and fought
I ain’t seen a hospital since my father died
I don’t like it there. Memories is locked inside
When I walked inside the room we started to cry
I was just so happy that you was alive
And you told me how much that you hate the hospital
And that they thieves and trying to keep their pockets full
I think I hold myself a little bit responsible
When you was smoking all the time I wasn’t stopping you
Nevertheless you came home and that was real
A lot of therapy and doctors gave you lots of pills
You couldn’t drive anymore. You had to stop and chill
And that’s too much for anybody that can stop your will
But you never got back to your norm
You was proud. Didn’t want any help from my mom
I left for tour and you asked me how long I’d be gone
And I could see inside your eyes you knew something was wrong
I got back. Mommy told me you was sick again
Couldn’t believe that we was going through this shit again
I love you Rock and I’m always gonna miss you friend
And for me it’s just the same story, different pen

[Hook: Liz Fullerton]
I am made of all four corners
All directions without the borders
I am strung so loose together
And you're a thread that holds forever
I'm not nobody's baby
You had your shit too
But you always came through for me
