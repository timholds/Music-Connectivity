[Notorious B.I.G.]
All you niggas better leave the fucking state, no need to masturbate
Fuckin' with Biggie, it's time to castrate
It's clobberin time
When I rip rhymes I quench thirsts like Very Fine
And I'm still thirsty - niggas wanna hurt the six-pack maniac
Tote TECs, and macs, black
Check the stacks, what the fuck?
I throw uppercuts like Riddick Bowe
And I'm wicked with the slow-flow, y'know?
I'm pressing hard, I'm leavin' creases
Cuttin' up bodies and talking to the pieces
It gets deep, kid, deep enough to touch the bone
Brooklyn's own, Al Capone
Get stoned off the blunt when it's filled with the skunk
Get drunk, and do a demolition to punk
And all chumps, that scream that my shit don't thump
They catch lumps and bumps, I'll put a shaker in your rump
