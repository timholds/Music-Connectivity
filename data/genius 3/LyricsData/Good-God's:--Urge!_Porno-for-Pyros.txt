Good Gods
Don't take away
My father
Give him back his legs

Don't take away his heart
Don't take away
His sun
His mind
His family

Good Gods
Don't take away
My father
Give him back his legs

If you can't help him
Then you can take me
His son
His mind
His heart

I'm his family
I'm his family
I'm his family

I wanna shark mark on my skin
Make it where I can see him
Fall of health and hungry

I want a shark mark on my skin
Make him fast, make him swim
He was raped and died lonely

Urge!
Give me urge!
Give me urge!

His eyes say "kill" to look at
Trust no man he mean as sin
Shame won't make you desperate
Seems like it's eterninty
Always leaning and restless

Give me urge!
Just give me urge!
Give me urge!
