[Verse 1]
There it go
Some of my dogs on the streets they sellin' blow
Say there's problems but they never want no smoke
I can't stunt, I rather give my brothers hope (Yeah, yeah)
From the projects we just tryna stay afloat
Rent that Rari, crash this shit and now you broke (Swooo)
In Miami with some hassadity hoes (Swooo)
Off this addy baby I won't get exposed
Ain't no pictures, please put down yo fuckin' phone

[Hook]
Bitch I'm gon roll that blunt
Bitch I might roll one up
Bitch I might call you back
Fuck it I just might stunt
Fuck it that's not my style
Said that’s hot last year
Nigga that's not right now
Nigga that's not right now

[Verse 2]
Mama know I been through hell
Pretty bitches with me smellin' like Chanel (Yeah)
Know they hatin' from the cribbo I could tell (Yeah)
Say they made me but I did this by myself
Hum, hum, hum, hum

[Hook]
Bitch I'm gon roll that blunt
Bitch I might roll one up (Ay)
Bitch I might call you back (Ay)
Fuck it I just might stunt (Ay)
Fuck it that's not my style (Yeah)
Said that’s hot last year
Nigga that's not right now (Yeah)
Nigga that's not right now

Bitch I'm gon roll that blunt
Bitch I might roll one up
Bitch I might call you back
Fuck it I just might stunt
Fuck it that's not my style
Said that’s hot last year
Nigga that's not right now
Nigga that's not right now
