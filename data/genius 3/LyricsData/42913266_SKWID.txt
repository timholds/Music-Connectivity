"This shit go out to
Sean Wee
That redhead kid in stat
Fuck you niðŸ…±ðŸ…±as you guys are fuqing snakes

Verse 1-

(Chef Tastee)-
Fuck these bitches, no more misses
Watch me dip, and I'll drip 'til yo' hoe can't even sip
I'm yo' man, call me Dan, bum yo' girl, in a van
Young boi, oh yes I can
Fuck with me, don't come to my shows
I don't wanna look at you hoe
If you can't even give me blow
Suck on my dick, because you're a bitch
Chippy Chippy whippy, no consent I'm feeling nippy
Homie you a hippy, take me home; unzip me
Boy you need to wash your hands
Bitch, I hope this ain't yo mans
Tastee cook you in the sauce
Cause, you're not my fucking boss
Natural artist like Bob Ross
Outta my pawn shop I'm Big Hoss


Hook-

(Lightning McGreens)-

Girl can't get over me
I'm smashing those ovaries
She still wish she was blowing me
She think she is owning me
Can't fuck you in Texas, why can't you get this
I led you to Grifs to square up a bet
Never caught feelings, I put them to rest


Verse 2-

(Yung Breadbox)-

*sensual female regurgitation*

Fuq Chip; that man cannot stand me
I call him his first name; the dude try to slam me
He yell 'bout his shower, and how it's so fancy
So I knock that boi out: boom boom; double whammy
Usually broke, but I pay for my candy
My two-dollar bill, in the back of your panty
My head keep on spinning. Barb what did you hand me?
Barb what am I holding; the tit or the fanny?
Chip comes to run over me;
Barb runs to cum over me
Hit her hard in Blackstar's car we ruined the upholstery
You ugly; as far as I can see
I'm at the front desk; she's demanding D
Wojtczak always looking hungry
Bitch, you could come hop on Sparccy meat


Hook-

(Lightning McGreens)-

Girl can't get over me
I'm smashing those ovaries
She still wish she was blowing me
She think she is owning me
Can't fuck you in Texas, why can't you get this
I led you to Grifs to square up a bet
Never caught feelings, I put them to rest


Verse 3-

(Twisty McGrif)-

*prolonged autistic screech*

Fuck with me!
I never give bitches apologies, never say sorry
I dare you to tell you on me
You will get dropped
Like those pictures you found in your box
I'm with lady Landtroop, she giving me top
Hit up the Kishun, yeah she got the pot
Pull his shower, make him louder, got no power, wife deflowered, I devour
See you at Publix, bitch
Tell on me, fucking snitch
See you at Publix, bitch
Tell on me, fucking snitch
See me at Publix, "hey what are you, stupid?"
Cap in yo ass; longbow like cupid
I don't eat chips, I only roast them
I'll find your door, and I'll tape a note on
