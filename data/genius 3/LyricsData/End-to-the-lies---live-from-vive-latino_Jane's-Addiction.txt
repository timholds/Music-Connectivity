You sit around there telling stories
Taking chips from old past glories
I had never thought that you'd wake
A single left, choose
With some parts that you can't use
That's why I never liked your pity parties
You never really change like they say
Oh, you'll only become more like yourself
He thought he knew me back in the day
When I was down but now now it's him cryin' help
You talk about me so much
That I think that you're in love with me
Yea, you do, it's true man, your busted
You talk about me to your friends
Or anyone with time to listen
You can never ever be trusted
You never really change like they say
Oh, you'll only become more like yourself
He thought he knew me back in the day
When I was down but It's him cryin' help
End to the lies, End to the lies
End to the lies, End to the lies
Now you
You were the foreskin
I was the real head
You were the foreskin
You never really change like they say
Oh, you'll only become more like yourself
He thought he knew me back in the day
When I was down but it's him cryin' help
End to the lies, End to the lies
End to the lies, End to the lies
End to the lies, End to the lies
End to the lies, End to the lies
