[KRS-One]
All you white people out there that think you're down with America can
Forget it. Cause they TAX all of us. All of us, one by one. Just
Take a look at Leona Helm-Helmsley. Taxed her, she's white I believe
*laughter* Yeah threw her butt right in jail. She ain't nothin but
Another ho, according to this system. *laughter* You ain't pay your
Taxes ho, get back in jail. *uproarious laughter*
