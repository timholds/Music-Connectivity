[Intro]

[Verse 1: Roger Waters]
Hello? (hello) (hello)
Is there anybody in there?
Just nod if you can hear me
Is there anyone at home?
Come on (come on), now
I hear you're feeling down
Well I can ease your pain
And get you on your feet again
Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: David Gilmour]
I have become comfortably numb

[Verse 2: Waters]
Okay
Just a little pin prick *ding*
There'll be no more ''AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!''
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

[Chorus 2: Gilmour]
There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I caught a fleeting glimpse
Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now
The child is grown
The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb

[Guitar Solo]
