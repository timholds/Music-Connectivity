Over the ground lies a mantle of white
A heaven of diamonds shine down
Through the night
Two hearts are thrillin' in spite of the
Chill in weather
Love knows no season
Love knows no clime
Romance can blossom any old time
Here in the open
We're walkin' and hopin' together

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he is Parson Brown
He'll say, "Are you married?"
We'll say, "No, man"
But you can do the job while you're in town
Later on we'll conspire
As we dream by the fire
To face unafraid the plans that we made
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

In the meadow we can build a snowman
And pretend that he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman
Until the other kiddies knock him down
When it snows ain't it thrillin'
Though your nose gets a chillin'
We'll frolic and play the Eskimo way
Walkin' in a winter wonderland

Sleigh bells ring, are you listenin'
In the lane, snow is glistenin'
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
Gone away is the bluebird
Here to stay is a new bird
He sings a love song, as we go along
Walkin' in a winter wonderland
