[Verse 1]
Angels cry every time you dance
I took a chance, I guess I met the devil in France
I shook his hand
White sand, black bandanas and semis
Jules stashed the work in the HEMI
We trap from Denny's
Quit Henney bad bitches I hit plenty
Here's a list of real niggas, me
I missed any? (I don't think so.)
Say a prayer like it's before dinner
Hot shells during the cold winter
Wonder why it’s all Balmain and Custom bought?
Cause Santa never had shit for a Muslim boy
Go and figure, go and figure
They roll over on you when they was rollin' with you
Code of honor like it's the holy scripture
Bet it's 2020 vision till that 40 hit you
Up for days mixing drugs with the paranoia
This one's for the dope boys stackin' just to pay the lawyer

[Bridge]
I sit at home all alone with the 44 under my pillow
Tryina dream, it's a cold winter
No friends, in the end they all pretend
Seven sins, talking revenge, I serve a cold dinner

[Hook]
Really came from nothing
Homie nothing's realla
Really came from nothing
Homie nothing's realla

[Verse 2]
Cold revenge so sweet, I'm chowing down
Mr. Chow, it’s fried lobster and kung-pow
Smoke a pound, I don't gotta put towers down
Presence fell, I'm around when out of town
Back on your set like fuck a setback
I was in the hole 2 mill
Pay the debt back, niggas throwin' chips on the table
Take your best bet, you can keep five off top
Bring the rest back
Foreign women and immigrant cars (Bonjour!)
A couple sin for an innocent heart
Crack the bag, make your nose twitch
Watches that don't tick for the whole clique
She wanna make a team, wanna make the team
She wanna make a team, wanna make a team
She really do!
She wanna make a team, wanna make a team
We're talking vivid, we can make the scene
Your beauty like funeral flowers
Your beauty like funeral flowers
Your beauty like funeral flowers
Such a dark and luminous power

[Bridge]
I sit at home all alone with the 44 under my pillow
Tryina dream, it's a cold winter
No friends, in the end they all pretend
Seven sins, talking revenge, I serve a cold dinner

[Hook]
Really came from nothing
Homie nothing's realla
Really came from nothing
Homie nothing's realla

[Bridge]
I sit at home all alone with the 44 under my pillow
Tryina dream, it's a cold winter
No friends, in the end they all pretend
Seven sins, talking revenge, I serve a cold dinner

[Hook]
Really came from nothing
Homie nothing's realla
Really came from nothing
Homie nothing's realla
