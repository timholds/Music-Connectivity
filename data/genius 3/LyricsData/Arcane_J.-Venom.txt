[Intro]

[Verse 1 - J. Venom]
Motherfuckers know when I'm about to come through
Cause they see me and the goddamned crew
NAC bitch, and you know that it's true
Spitting till the sky stops being blue
I could rap about lame shit for money too
And I'd be like most other rappers, that's the truth
Bullshitting my way to a fucking paycheck
Hoping ya'll ain't notice that my rhymes are fucking whack
Uh, yeah, now, I'm back on deck
CTD, turnin rappers into wrecks
Like a Hollywood director, just screaming "NEXT!"
I'm the fucking man so you better respect
A sting in my arm, venom in my brain
Bringing that magic bitch, you can call it arcane
Yeah your fucking mom might call me profane
But she got no problems when she giving brain

[Bridge]
Bitch, yeah, JV
Giving her that D
Up in VIP
For free

[Verse 2 - Dextro]
Sit back relaxed riding public transit again
Still the top crew NAC be nothing but friends
I rock it till the end I got dollars staying broke
I hustle up some fast cash gotta get some dank to smoke
Yes I toke and I choke to a rhythm that I flow to
Never be getting played just like a ho do you know who this is
Its Dextro ripping rhymes and doing this for the kids
I'm sick of weak shit being played that's not art
I'm not a cocky cat but you can tell it lacks heart
So from the start right to the finish line we design
The type of rhyme that's gonna spark a storm up in your mind
Elevation yes we fly past the deception and lies
Surprise we getting high like we be finding new planes
Spellcasting arcane hit the paper making flames
Ya'll already know the name so I ain't gotta speak it
Stimulating like cocaine got all the heads tweaking

[Outro]
