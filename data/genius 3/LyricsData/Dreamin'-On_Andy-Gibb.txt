She takes the heart of mine
She make it beat in time
In fact she's mine forever
And I'll never ever know the reason why
Funny how she writes letters to me
She's only human but she keeps goin' through me
We came to love in the neighborhood
And the love don't cease to grow
And if you need me darlin'
I'll be dreamin' on
Dreamin' on for you baby
Dreamin' on for you woman-child
Dreamin' on for you baby

She makes the skies grow dark
She makes the darkness bright
She make the wind grow warm in
The wake of another cold and stormy night
And anywhere she needs me I'll be runnin' to
'cause she fits me like a glove
And tho I'd really like to be with you
She gave me love when there was no love
And I would not let her go
So if you need me darlin'
I'll be dreamin' on
Dreamin' on for you baby
Dreamin' on for you woman-child
Dreamin' on for you baby

I'll be dreamin' on
Dreamin' on for you baby
Dreamin' on for you woman-child
Dreamin' on for you baby

Ah....

For you baby
Ah...
