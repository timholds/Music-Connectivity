Listen while I talk to you
I'll tell you what we're gonna do
There's a new thing
That's goin' around
And I'll tell you
What they're puttin' it down
Just move your body round and round
And just shake

Aw mama shake
That's the way to do it
Shake!
Aw you're lookin'
Good now, shake!

Shake it like a bowl of soup
Make your body loop the loop
Put your hands on your hips
Kind a let your backbone slip
Move your body like a whip
And just shake
Um that's done it
Shake!

Yeah, you're lookin' good now
Shake!
Shake!

Ding-a-ling
Honey, shkin' is the latest thing
And if you want to
Swing just loosen up your shoulders
If you want to really roll
You got to do the thing with soul

Shake the shake with all your might
And if you do it, do it right

Just make your body
Loose and light
And just shake!

Aw honey shake!
Oh, shake!
Aw that's the way to do it
Shake!
