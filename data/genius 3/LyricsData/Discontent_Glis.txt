I used to look up to you
I wanted to be just like you
I thought you would change
But now I only dislike you
All the things that you said have lost all meaning to me
You've run away from the truth, but the pain is what haunts you
You take your lies to the top
I have no feelings inside
They're all corrupted with hate...
Filled with rage and demise
All the things that you said have lost all meaning to me
You've run away from the truth, but the pain is what haunts you
...And the lies in your eyes are the scars that confine you
