[Verse 1]
Let’s shoot some whiskey
Let’s drink some beer
Play me some Whitley
Let’s strip some gears
Let’s take the big truck
I got it jacked
Break out the good stuff
Pour me some black

[Chorus]
Let’s get the beer joint rocking !
The whole house hopping
Bottle tops popping
Everybody bopping
Let’s get the beer joint rocking !!

[Verse 2]
This ain't the city
This ain't the hood
We ain't just crackers here
And pecker woods
Here in the down home
Out in the sticks
Way more going on
Than chiggers and ticks

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Hey Mr. DJ
Play something loud
One so the cowgirls
Can shake it out
Turn up the guitar
Bang on that drum
Light up this hick bar
Let’s have some fun !

[Chorus]
