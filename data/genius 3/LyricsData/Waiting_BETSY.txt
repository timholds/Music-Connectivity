[Verse 1]
It's only a feeling but it lurks over me
It's a beautiful pain I can't ignore
Tell me why can't I hide the way I want this to be
'Cause you know, you know that I would die to hold you
Say you'll be there now just waiting for me
'Cause this hard hitting love don't seem to fade
I live for the chance that one day you'll see
And you'll know, you'll know that I can't breathe without you

[Pre-Chorus]
Just take my hand before I rise to the heavens
Oh just take my heart with you 'cause I know, 'cause I know

[Chorus]
I've been waiting, waiting forever for you
I've been searching, searching forever
Hell saw my fire, I know it's the right thing to do
You know I've been waiting forever for you

[Post-Chorus]
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
You know I've been waiting forever for you
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
You know I've been waiting forever

[Verse 2]
There in your eyes, the light I've wanted to see
Your smile's so familiar to me now
Can't hold back this feeling that's been holding to me
Oh please, tell me it's the same for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Just take my hand before I rise to the heavens
Oh just take my heart with you 'cause I know, 'cause I know

[Chorus]
I've been waiting, waiting forever for you
I've been searching, searching forever
Hell saw my fire, I know it's the right thing to do
You know I've been waiting forever for you

[Post-Chorus]
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
You know I've been waiting forever for you
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
You know I've been waiting forever

[Outro]
Been waiting for you
Been waiting for you
Been waiting
You know I've been waiting forever for you
For you
For you
For you
