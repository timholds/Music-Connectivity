Intro
[Nas] *talking
I want to dedicate this song right here
To Jonathan Jackson and George Jackson
Peace to those brothers

I want to shout out my man Sherm the Worm
Eighty years
Come home nigga
Come home, niggers

Ugh

[Verse 1]
I just burnt my American flag
And sent three cracker Nazis to hell and I'm sad
Ugh, I'm loading tefs in my mag
To send these redneck bigots some death in a bag
Choke him out with his confederate flag
I know these devils are mad
Little rap fans who live way out in safe suburbia
Would you stand with me, a United States murdurer?

Chorus:
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
Huh? Would you Testify?
You buy my songs
You buy my songs
But will you ride with me?
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
You understand my struggle
That's what you claim right?
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
Then get your aim right
And get your game tight

[Verse 2]
Don't buy my songs, y'all don't roll with it
Coming to concerts singing ho and shit
Fuck y'all lil' lil' ho bitches
I don't need y'all, I'll go gold with it
I heard y'all was downloading it (heh)
Like I'm y'all man who be exposing shit (heh)
Like uhh, William Cooper
Who told you the Pale Horse is the future

Chorus:
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
Would you testify on some realness like that?
I think you scared (heh)
I don't think you prepared
Yeah
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
You know what I'm asking you?
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
Do you know what I'm asking you? (*laughs)
Wow...
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
Wow...
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
*sings (Testifyyyyy for me)
