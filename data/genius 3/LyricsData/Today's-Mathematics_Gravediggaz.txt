[Intro: Poetic]
Yo! Gravediggaz (yeah)
Yo! Y'all know what time it is (Gatekeeper, Grym Reaper)
Diggin up another plot
Dumb, deaf and blind niggas out here trynashine

[Verse 1: Poetic]
Uhh, who give a fuck about a cop
When they move through the Brooklyn blocks lickin a shot?
Where the hardrocks at and the super thug killers?
If it ain't revolution then fuck y'all niggas
You talk about heating up, blocks and streets
But your Glocks go to sleep on the cops and beasts
Aiyo, if I gotta see another black momma cry
Tony T-I, I bring fuckin drama 'til I die
If y'all ain't ready to walk that walk
Don't talk that talk cause I live in New York
Where the Mayor condones the outline in chalk
And the big blue gang stalks and bangs your corpse
And forced black American rebels into a rage
To force back Samaritan devils into a cage
I'm the New World Order, the voice of electric
Currents of manslaughter, unhand my daughters
And sons all Babylon, you're gonna hate me
Worser than Farrakhan even when I'm gone
My words carry on, my herds respond
Freedom is the road that my peeps travel on
My rap verse attacks first then come the black hearse
The wicked and weak, hurting my peeps is gonna catch worse
No justice, no peace
It's just us kids in the streets going to war with beasts

[Hook x2: Poetic]
Peace God, what's today's mathematics?
The Gods wreak havoc on the weak wicked and savage
Leave 'em in a panic, then take advantage
In the 2-Triple-0, we knock 'em off the planet

[During Hook: Frukwan]
Peace to the gods

[Verse 2: Frukwan]
Seeking inner sanctions, I don't tangle with Satan
Pouring crosswind what, navigations
Original hypocrites turned Digital, access pivotal
Metaphysical state, you can't relate
Where each drop of water, symbolic to atomic slaughter
Of Aurora comets, pay homage
I seek prominence, chop heads off devils
Remain dominant, blackness my practice of tolerance
Guided through a tower of scholars, mind equal in power
Collisions brought about, tactical violence
Simplistic, warriorlistic type knights
That existed in a crucifix that's twisted
Hex cursed upon the X, but I respond
In six sects, (?) intense foe bein four hundred million shoguns
Plug inside my dungeon for a psychiatric spongin
Foolish intrusion thumps in brain transfusions, I'm born true eyed
At this moment, while my opponents are what? Terrified

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Frukwan]
Fuckin devils are evil, the hunger and pain
In the father's plane of regents, I pledge allegiance
Swore to defend Allah's universal revenge, conceal secrecy
The emblem of justice placed above the head frequencies
Shaped in form of the dark matter
Using ultra gamma rays to shatter their stagment
Broke your compounds to fragments
Induced the science of hypnosis
Causing their mind to combine summer solstice

[Verse 4: Poetic]
As my soldiers testify, the Boogie Down, Brooklyn and Queens
Is bein sprayed with green pesticides
But we the only pest that dies
Not the roaches, mosquitoes, the rats or the flies
That's just a lie to cover until the cops hover
Over the city to make people of color just sufffer
I pity the unprepared
Who ain't tryna hear what I'm kicking in his ear
We all aware cash rules but some are unaware
Where and when to blast tools, when to act cool
Cause when you pursue beef on the street corner
Beasts bring the heat like a deep sauna
So I keep on a glorious path in some water
Blessed with the warrior's wrath

[Hook]
