[Verse 1]
On my way to you, old county
Hoping nothing's changed
That your pain is never-ending
That is, it's still the same
County line
County line
County line
I left so far behind

[Chorus]
And you never even tried to love me
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
What did I have to do to make you want me?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
I feel so blind, I can't make out the passing road signs
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
All that you would have me do is cross that county line
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
County line

[Instrument Break]

[Verse 2]
Now you know I'm coming, old county
To see construction sites
And your new homes never-ending
I think I can see the lights
County line
County line
County line
I can smell the columbine

[Chorus]
You never even tried to love me
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
What did I have to do to make you want me?
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
I feel so blind, I can't make out the passing road signs
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
All that you would have me do is cross that county line
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
County line

[Outro]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
County line
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
County line
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
County line
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa
