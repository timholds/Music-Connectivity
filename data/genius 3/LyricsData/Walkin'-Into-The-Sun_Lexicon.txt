Walk into the sun
You gotta walk till you can't walk no mo
Walk into the sun
Honey This The Time We Gotta Go
(Repeat)

I remain unfazed by the blaze of my sins
Sacrificed my life so I'm playing to win
Seen droughts and floods streets got natural disasters
An ounce of bud actually get you blasted
I came a long way from them Raleigh head busters
Ten the hard way when a body left dusted
Grew up wit some killers of kilter
Hang you from a tree and say that you was the klan victim
Crack fiends used to rob me to taste hells sand
Hate living escape to prison making cell plans
Getting dehydrated cause they funds ain't liquid
Touching dimes cutting lines cause  guns ain't scripted
Trying to launder they pockets but the cleaners is closed
Pondering profits so my demeanor is cold
Knew some queens caught that AIDS shooting boy in they arm
Heart heavy trying to walk steady they lacing wit raw
Seen my first ounce of glass at thirteen
Stole spirits as souls peering in the earths seams we thirst cream
Trying to build with a shaky foundations
Silent screams spill when violence stagnated

I'm walking into the sun and yall thought it was over
I told yall once before now I'm gone have to show ya
I'm walking into the sun me and my weary soldiers
We been bearing that load so you know you can't hold us
(Repeat)

Walk into the sun
You gotta walk till you can't walk no mo
Walk into the sun
Honey This The Time We Gotta Go

They used to rape little boys on my block
Crooked cops buying butchered box on night watch
Momma caught the cancer lost her hair and gave that shit back
Ask god for an answer do he care I'm feeling trapped
You got intestinal fortitude well we eat chitlins
Want to know your fortune fool
Them cookies delicious
See I flipped this shit like parkour
No boats in the sea of pain I harbored
Yet far more endured worse
Reminded my gears grinded but I'm never in reverse
Traversed this pure hurt
Boy got his head chopped broad day at the barbershop
9 shots he gossiped bout who got got
Even fallen angels once knew the lord
Broken hearts score but so few on the board
I wade through the river of darkness
I could get you to first base even if you not pitching the hardest
Washing my sins so my blood on the line
A menace see they wanna sentence me so they judging my rhymes
I be current but waves turning so I stay backwards
In the windows of my eyes dwindled lives left  shattered

Hook/hook

Sometimes I wonder how I made it through (how I made it through child)
My momma told me I'ma pray for you (pray for the babies)
Sometimes I wonder how I made it through (how I made it through child)
My momma told me I'ma pray for you (blow Anwar)
