[Verse 1: Dels]
I’m a tired soul like Mica Levi
And it’s weighing heavy
As we argue, fight, unnecessary
Throw verbal darts, straight through the heart
Rip it apart, discard the pieces, hiding the scars
It won’t last if we carry on like this...
This fighting beneath the stars
Release the tension, A catharsis
As we spin around in darkness
Watch the curtains open slowly as we go back to the start
“Let’s not blow it” like a cartridge, so she says
“Don’t be heartless come to bed, soak your problems in a bath and it will pass”
But my guts screaming otherwise
As I synthesise, all these feelings that I feel
Lost in the loop, hypnotised
Treading on a wire, high in the sky, perspire
Sky diving in a whirlwind of fire
She’s a liar, I've already seen in my dreams
Now realities showing me things, what will it bring?
You don’t vanish when I sleep
Because I see you in my dreams on that late night creep

[Hook]
Swimming at the deep end
Singing at Moonrise
Screaming as the sun falls
We’re burning down
All the love, we pretend
Cover up white lies
We’re going down

[Verse 2: Dels]
The beach is burning, heart is yearning, bathing in the flames
As vultures circle in the sky, the wind sings my name
The moon rises from the ocean, vision’s crystalised
Like I’ve had a Mandy platter
Colours dripping from my eyes
To my surprise, I heard my Mrs. from a distance
And I run towards the sound, in the sand I leave an imprint
I’m running on the spot though I can’t move, Image skewed
Beneath the shrew lies hidden truths in sticky goo
No wind surfing on these sheets
Tossing and turning, beaches are burning in my sleep
Apocalyptic view, what a morbid vision
And I’ve just seen my girlfriend kissing
Another Brother with his face missing
Makes no sense in my brain man
Listen, I hear the snakes hissing
Snakes slither in grass I can’t cut
When paranoia’s lid on my heart is slammed shut
