Never alone
Use your heart as a telephone
Never alone
You know Montell won't do you wrong

I asked your woman, why she's crying
She told me she was lonely
She thought you were perfect guy
But you could never love her only

Don't get me wrong, I'm not the one
Breaking up a happy home
It's the lonely man who understands
She don't wanna be alone

Never alone
Use your heart as a telephone
Never alone
You know Montell won't do you wrong

So I ask her if you treat her right
She don't deny that your love is tight
But sometimes she only needs a friend
When she calls on me, quarter after three
Holding pillows to the phone [Incomprehensible]
It's her lonely heart that you're tearing apart
You don't even have a clue

You don't have to be alone, baby
Anytime you cry, day or night
You'll never be alone
Use your heart as a telephone, baby
It's not too late, 'cause this must die
Before you run to me

Never alone
Use your heart as a telephone
Never alone
You know Montell won't do you wrong

You don't have to be alone, baby
Anytime you cry, day or night
You'll never be alone
Use your heart as a telephone, baby
It's not too late, 'cause this must die
Before you run to me

Never alone
Use your heart as a telephone
Never alone
You know Montell won't do you wrong

The woman's lonely
She's reaching out
Needs to talk to
Someone who's willing to listen
Is it you? Will you be there?
I know she was my woman
