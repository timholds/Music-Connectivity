[Verse 1]
Alone here tonight, looking up at the sky
Wondering how I let her go
Did I hold her too tight, heaven only knows
A bottle of wine, a day in the sunshine
Seems like we shared everything
Yeah I felt her love but I never saw her wings

[Chorus]
And that's the trouble with angels
That's the trouble with angels
You can try and make her stay
But she's bound to fly away
That's the trouble with angels

[Verse 2]
Wherever you are, no matter how far
I hope you'll always understand
I'm saving you a soft place to land
It's crazy I know talking like you're still so close
But the memory endures
Are you listening, I never know for sure

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
That's the trouble with angels
She'll fly
