[Intro: Charlie Scene]
I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine, and I'mma take it

[Chorus: Charlie Scene]
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
Now when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye
So take a page from my book
Roll it up and get cooked
Watch these ladies get hooked
While all these haters get shook
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
And when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
We gonna rise up to the top, we've been through it all
Been to fucking hell and back, our backs against the wall
Got the dove and grenade flag on display
And every fucking critic's gonna listen when we say

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Scene]
I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine, and I'mma take it

[Chorus: Charlie Scene]
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
And when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye
So take a page from my book
Roll it up and get cooked
Watch these ladies get hooked
While all these haters get shook
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
And when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye

[Verse 2: Danny & J-Dog]
So just understand nothing gets in my way
I can show you firsthand if you got something to say
If you think you can hold me down, you better think twice
'Cause I've been waiting for this moment every day of my life
These fucking people always say the same old thing
But you can't slay or conquer the king
I'm from a nightmare, but I'm living the dream
You need to back up if you're not with my team

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Scene]
'Cause I do whatever it takes to make it
Break through anything I'm face to face with
It's true, you gon' make me lose my patience
'Cause victory is mine, and I'mma take it

[Chorus: Charlie Scene]
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
And when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye
So take a page from my book
Roll it up and get cooked
Watch these ladies get hooked
While all these haters get shook
So put your hands up high
And wave 'em side to side
And when I pull out the nine
You better wave bye bye
You better wave bye bye
You better wave bye bye
You better wave bye bye
You better wave bye bye
