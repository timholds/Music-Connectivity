Oh yeah, coming right back at cha
With a different type of swing
You know, you better ask somebody
Baby, this is for you, and you, and definitely you

I'm the type of guy who takes time to just kick back
I turn around my baseball cap
I have a 40 sitting on my lap
Slamming the ivories until I sees
A female worth my while
I'm scoping it, checking a smile
And I know that I can get it
And I'll hit it if she's wit' it
I get the 5 to the 6-7 digits
Call her up on my cellular
And all the shit that I'll say to her
The fun will begin when I hit the skizins
So if a girlie is lonesome
I think that she knows where to go when she wants some
Cuz Monty ain't here for nothing but I gotta let all

Somethin' 4 da Honeyz, Somethin' 4 da Honeyz
Somethin' 4 da Honeyz, Somethin' 4 da Honeyz

Summertime, no funner time for me to kick in with you
To find some things I wanna get into
I call up my crew I tell them bring a brew
And some Hennessey for the beach party
So call up your girlfriends
And you know there always tends to be an ugly one
But bring her, too
Fat or skinny she likes to shoop
With Montell and the SL Coup
While the beat is bumpin' from South Central to Compton
A little somethin' somethin'

Could very well be the next Aaron Neville
Sounding like nobody cuz I'm on another level
And ya fellas can't take it with a shovel
But it ain't for you

Somethin' 4 da Honeyz, Somethin' 4 da Honeyz
Somethin' 4 da Honeyz, Somethin' 4 da Honeyz

This is somethin' for the honeyz
When you're rolling
Summertime, oh so fine
It feels all right
Summertime tonight, something for you honey

The "M" "O" the "N" "T" to the "E" double "L"
And yes I'm guaranteeing that I won't be felon
Some people call me Monty, some call me Monty Swinger
Sometimes I bust around but I'm an R&B singer
And I'm a go on and flow on
And you tell two friends and she'll tell two
And so on and so on
Another number 1 hit so get your roll on
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Somethin' 4 da Honeyz, Somethin' 4 da Honeyz
Somethin' 4 da Honeyz, Somethin' 4 da Honeyz
