I'm in a bad mood
Got an ache in my head
You always knew me
I'm the one who gets out the books under the bed

I'm feeling [?]
My outlook's grey
So I make sure everyone
Joins me in another miserable day

Cause I'm angry angry
I'm so irate
I'm angry angry
I work myself into a terrible state

I'm angry angry
Down to my soul
I'm angry angry
My blood is up and I'm out of control

Friends all think that I'm toad
When they see me, they cross the road
I'll get even, I'll get back
Smile so sweet and then attack

I'll scream and shout
On the phone all day
Stamp my feet
To get my way

I'll be obnoxious
Rude and rough
Then hide away
Before they call, call, call

My bluff

My wife just left me
She's taken the kids
How could a nice guy like me
So quickly end up on the skids

I'm feeling lonely
And sorry for myself
The world's against me
It's not my fault; it's everyone else

I'm angry angry
I'm all fired up
I'm angry angry
Sensitivity's high and I'm ready to [?]

I'm angry angry
I'm looking for a fight
I'm angry angry
I got to be [?] I got to be right

When I'm driving in my car
I look for the moment to be pushed too far
Then I can forget my age
And lose myself in righteous rage

I'll cut you off
Drive dangerously
Try and make you
Just like me

Why should you sit there
Oh so cool
[?]
And say that here goes, there goes

Where goes that fool?

I'm always quick to take offense
I don't care if I make no sense
A careless look, a chance remark
Will make me turn a nice day, fine day

Bright day, right into dark

I'm angry angry
So irate
I'm angry angry
I get myself into a terrible state

I'm angry angry
Angry angry
Really really angry angry
Angry Angry

Really really really angry angry
Angry angry angry
Angry angry
I'm really angry

Oh I'm so irate

Really really very angry
Ohh I'm angry angry
Oh I'm so pissed off
Angry angry

Really really angry angry
Very very very very
[?]
Angry angry angry angry

Really really really angry
