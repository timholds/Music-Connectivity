This whiskey's sour
Armateur hour
Raise your bottle, toast your friends
Someday we shall fight again
Well your enemies
Your tragedies
Pocket knives and rusty chains
Where the hell is the old gang at?

And all the losers can't even win for losing
And the beginners dont even know what song they're singing
Well there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break when it doesnt even pound
Well there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break when it doesnt even pound
OLE!

This broken scene
Is turning green
Brass knuckles left in the rain
Death wish kids among the living
I wanna ride
On the divided
Anything but the mainstream
Where the fuck is your old gang, man?

And all the losers can't even win for losing
And the beginners dont even know what song they're singing
Well there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break when it doesnt even pound
Well there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break when it doesnt even pound

Ooh!
So long!
You didn't even say goodbye!
So long!
There's nowhere to go when you're hiding in plain sight!

Well there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break when it doesnt even pound
Well there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break when it doesnt even pound

Well there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break when it doesnt even pound
Well there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break when it doesnt even pound

Well there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break when it doesnt even pound
Well there's no one left around
And you're the last gang in town
And your heart can't even break when it doesnt even pound
