[Verse 1]
All we do is mess around
But I know that it's love we found
And I know that it's here to stay
It's more than just a word we say

[Verse 2]
No, I don't want to fuss or fight
And I'm not one to give advice
But there's no need to be afraid
Baby, there's no time to waste

[Chorus]
Sing until you have no voice
Sing because you have no choice
Sing until you float away
Our love is like a big blue wave

It's like a big blue wave

[Verse 3]
Don't tell me that we've come this far
To start again or fall apart
Sing it when you're lost at sea
And love will bring you back to me

[Chorus]
Sing until you have no voice
Sing because you have no choice
Sing until you float away
Our love is like a big blue wave

Sing until you have no voice
Sing because you have no choice
Sing until you float away
Sing until you're home again

Sing until you have no voice
Sing because you have no choice
Sing until you float away
Our love is like a big blue wave

It's like a big blue wave
