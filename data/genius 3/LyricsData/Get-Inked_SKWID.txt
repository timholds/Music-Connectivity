(Lightning McGreens)-
"We out here
2016
This one goes out to Barbara Wojtczak
Gang gang!
You know what's up
Yuh yuh yuh!"


Hook-

(Lightning McGreens)-
Life is a highway
I am not a lightweight
Lightning McGreens
Got rack up my sleeves, yaugh
SKWID's gon' make you bounce
If you pull up on our block
Tiny tower is my game
It's gon' get me tiny laid!

(Twisty McGrif)-
Skrt in that road race
Value is too great
Yung boi twisty
Your mom kissed me
SKWID gon take you out
When you pull up on our block
Ink-bois always spitting flames
Never losing foosball games!


Verse 1-

(Yung Breadbox)-
Shoal always lookin' fine
Without ever even tryin'
Yung boi; in my prime
Your whole crew look like some swine
Flip a brick like a dime
Sip yo' bitch like a wine
Might be some invertebrates, but you know we got spine
Ink mix; lemon lime
Raking in that loud pine
Petty crime; pipe line
Shit that you would never try
Little man; little bribe
Wrap it up in the twine
Yeah, I'm stacked up like a pringles can, so the bank might as well be mine

Verse 2-

(Chef Tastee)-
Chef Tastee serve you up
I refill yo' water cup
Yo' girl hit my line
Sorry boyo, please don't whine
You wanna race but Sparccy's turbo ain't no game
Fuck Ed, Edd n Eddy
SKWID get em' fucking inked
They call me "Double D"
Double D bitches are all I need
Mama told me, "don't put it in if they don't bleed"
Bitches put them hashtags; I gotta pound em'
Tastee make em' flip; no bitch can resist
