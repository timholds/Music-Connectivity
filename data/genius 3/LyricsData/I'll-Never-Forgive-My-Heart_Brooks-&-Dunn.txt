[Verse 1]
Hello heartache who let you in
Swore the last time - never again
Back together, just you and me
Where's you old friend Mr. Misery

[Verse 2]
I went and did it I dropped my guard
I fell in and I fell hard
Now she's sayin' she's found someone new
How could I have been such a fool

[Chorus]
Oh, close the door, turn out the lights, draw the curtain
I'll get over her in time, it's gonna take some hurtin'
Oh, I tell myself I told you so, as I fall apart
I can't blame love, but I'll never forgive my heart

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Oh, close the door, turn out the lights, draw the curtain
I'll get over her in time, it's gonna take some hurtin'
Oh, I tell myself I told you so, as I fall apart
I can't blame love, but I'll never forgive my heart

[Outro]
Oh, I can't blame love, but I'll never forgive... my heart
