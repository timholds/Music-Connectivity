Looking at the mirror, reflect on my reflection
And perceive what others choose to believe
Strive to stay alive, and get what is mine, in life
But scarred by misery, which cuts like a knife
Use my third eye to make a plan, and understand
Draw a conclusion, but it's just an illusion
Look at the color of my skin and I'm done in
By my culture, which swoops like a vulture
Not all, but just biggots and hypocrites
Who potray as being white, but they're not legit
Try to say that we all down in the same gang
But when I turn my back, there's a scam!
How many times do I run into racists?
And that's one thing, I know, I don't forget faces
Pick up the pace, and reach for the finish line
But there's a bubble that stops me all the time
Now I'm sent right back down to the drawing board
My callouses hurt on my hands cuz they're sore
I'm try'nna break loose, to break out from the rubble
But still I'm trapped inside a bubble

"Ahh shit, well here comes the Blakspik" "Naci Moreno"
(I'm trapped, I'm trapped inside a bubble)
"Ahh shit, well here comes the Blakspik" "Naci Moreno"
(I'm trapped, I'm trapped inside a bubble)
"Ahh shit, well here comes the Blakspik" "Naci Moreno"
(I'm trapped, I'm trapped inside a bubble)
"I'm Puerto Rican..." "speakin' so that you know"

Sandpaper's rough, but life's kinda rougher
And when you're my complexion, you know it gets tougher
I try to motivate and elevate to a positive level
And don't fall down the ladder to the devil
I try to ignore them and flow smooth like water
But how many dads don't want me with their daughters
It's not cuz I'm a bad fellow, that's not the case
It's cause, my features are dark on my face
My grandfather's father and father before him
Came from an ancient tribe of Indians
Once they ruled the land, five million deep
Now that land is stripped and so dirt cheap
People start bugging when they hear me speaking Spanish
Cuz my ideas of Hispanic, is somewhat been blemished
Is it cuz my pants are baggy in the back, oh
Or is it cuz my hair ain't straight, in a pushback
Or is it cuz my name ain't Pedro, don't talk with no accent
But who said an accent can descend us
I'm here to break loose, to break out on the rubble
But still I'm trapped inside a bubble

Frustrated from the ignorance, the has me confined
So for me to shine, I just write, a dope rhyme
And find a little niche in the back of my skull cap
While I can meditate, relax, and be all that
But once I come back to reality, I feel the pain
I feel the hate, and still they try to violate
I try to break loose and shake the suckas off my back
Yeah, but still find myself trapped...
