[LEO, spoken]
And I just want to wish everybody ... good luck!

[ROGER, CARMEN, FRANZ]
Ahhhhh!

[ROGER]
Mr. Bloom! Hasn't anyone ever told you?
It's bad luck to say "good luck" on opening night?
If you do, I tell you
It is certain by the curtain
You are through!

[MAX, spoken]
Good luck!

[CARMEN]
It's bad luck to say "good luck" on opening night
Once it's said, you are dead
You will get the worst reviews
You've ever read!

[MAX, spoken]
Good luck!

[ROGER]
Even at the Comedie-Francaise
On the opening night, they are scared
"Bon chance, mes amis", no one says
The only word you ever hear is...

[ROGER, CARMEN, FRANZ]
Merde!

[MAX, spoken]
Good luck, good luck, good luck

[FRANZ]
It's verboten, vishing "luck" on opening night
Take advice, don't think twice
Or your show will surely end
Up in the Scheiss!

[MAX]
Guten lucken

[CARMEN]
At the famous La Scala in Milan On opening night it's a rule
"In boccu lupa" they say with elan
And just for luck they all shout...

[ROGER, CARMEN, FRANZ]
"Bah fongool!"

[LEO]
I got it!
Now I'll never say "good luck" on opening night
That's the rule, I'm no fool
What do I say, I beg?

[ROGER, CARMEN, FRANZ]
What you say is "break a leg"!

[LEO, spoken]
Break a leg?

[ROGER, CARMEN, FRANZ, spoken]
Yes, break a leg!

[ALL BUT MAX]
If you're clever...

[MAX]
Good luck!

[ALL BUT MAX]
You'll endeavor
To never, never, never, never
Ever, ever, ever say

[BLACK CAT]
Mraaawww!!

[ALL BUT MAX]
On opening night!
