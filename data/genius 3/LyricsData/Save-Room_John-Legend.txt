[Verse 1]
Say that you'll stay a little
Dont say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
Just a little bit of love
Is worth a moment of your time
Knockin' on your door just a little
It's so cold outside tonight
Let's get a fire burning
Oh I know I'll keep it burning bright
If you stay, won't you save, save

[Hook]
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me?

[Verse 2]
This just might hurt a little
Love hurts sometimes when you do it right
Dont be afraid of a little bit of pain
Pleasure is on the other side
Let down your guard just a little
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
You will see, I can be all you need
If you stay, won't you save, save

[Hook]
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me?

[Verse 3]
Oh c'mon
Make time to live a little
Don't let this moment slip by tonight
You'll never know what you're missing
'till you try, I'll keep you satisfied if you stay
Won't you save, save

[Hook]
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me?
