A sister want's a brother
Always trying to please another
Young girls wish they were old
A petal wants to be it's own rose

Life has such funny ways
But don't regret you came
See life is always changing
Yet life remains the same
So much to gain...
To win...to lose...to try
Oh yeah, it's all a part of life
To heel...to feel...to be real
Oh yeah, it's all a part of life

Empty pages will find words someday
A perfect person will disobey
You may never find true love
Why must one be taken advantage of...

Life has such funny ways
But don't regret you came
See life is always changing
Still life remains the same
So much to gain...
To win...to lose...to try
Oh yeah, it's all a part of life
To laugh...to hope...to dream...to cope
It's all a part of life

Oh no, not without a fight
I won't give up... I won't give up
Don't give up... don't give up
Don't give up... don't give up...
