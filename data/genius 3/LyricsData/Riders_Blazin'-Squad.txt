(Flava)
I have a vision, tell me what's wrong with dat
X-ray so I can see what's guarn wid dat
I'm gonna help people in need wot and that's that
You know me I don't want nothing back coz
What these people need is British rap so they can live their lives without fear of arch enemies
And Satans peeps it's a bird it's a plane but it's on the beat
Super Flava's on the street bounce back again
For the crowd again I wanna stop bad guys in their tracks again
I wanna help old ladies carry bags for them coz
World peace is what I intend
And I'm gonna lick it up wid my powers dem
Nobody in the world can seewhen I'm in the dark ducking out watching friends in the park when
It's gonna start
And if it goes off I'm gonna blow up and if I ain't seen then you're still gonna know it
Flava's presence in the air
From here to America from there to wherever
Identify never known people hink they're clever
Cape crusader who goes there
Chicks wanna know but I don't really care
The end is near so have no ear
So they ask us

(CHORUS)
(All)
Why do we fly so high
Flying through the sky
Just live your lives
Don't mess with us
Why do we fly so high
Flying through the sky
Just live your lives
Don't mess with us

We are the riders riders
Come flash your lighters higher
Don't retire
Entire worlds on fire
We're the riders
We're the fighters
We are the riders riders
Come flash your lighters higher
Don't retire
Entire worlds on fire
We're the riders
We're the fighters

(Reepa)
I've got split personalities
In my mentalities
One of me two of me Japanese Chinese
So what do you reckon when you see me in my mask
Stopping criminal tasks I'm there I'm gone fast I'll be watching you like a hawk
You think I will stalk
Why people started to talk about what we do at night
Did we give you a fright when we were stopping that fight cause I stay out the light
So Reepa's gonna stay on the street serve and protect can you feel the effect as I connect you
Bet another bad guy locked up another one behind bars
My crime stoppign rating I'm rated five stars
So at the end of the dayz
I can sit back and blaze another criminal down another criminal pays
If you see us in the shadows bad guys beware, Blazin' don't stop will arrest you there

(REPEAT CHORUS)
(Freek)
I am a man that will win so spin
Burning down crime like the dust in the wind
Never coming till the lights go dim
When Freek comes through the streets they shout so loud 'It's him,' help peoples asses
Save people's lives
Jacking them digits and jacking then knives
My kru's Blazin' and we're bringing them vibes
Like Robin Hood I get rid of bad guys
Coz man get smoked and man get jacked
As I breeze through the street with the F on my back
To attack with my sack never lack that's the end of my rap and that is that

(Spike-e)
Reload it's time to bust rhyme
Hit em when I bill em I'm busting and I'm robbing and I'm still never copying
Busting never trusting
Hit em wid da dust ting
Come mans what wanna swing
I'm a bad man from down da down town
Who wanna check the sensational sound hit the ground got a bloodhound
Fangs so sharp they rip roar
Let him off the muzzle
In a bit of trouble
There goes your clic ha, ha, ha
I'm a bad chatter
About to chat fatter
T-Tom B no-one's better
Getting kinda hotter tongue tied knotter
Selecta ta, ta, ta

(Rocky B)
Beanies they call me B Rocka
Coz I rough up and hot up
Any top shotter
Tottenham, Chingford all be da manors
Pettchy ten LT who's nanger
Every man dem on the street
Wanna bang her
If they do then Rock B's
In da slammer
Juice my girl on da regular
Pass me my Nokia
Blaze like a pro coz I've got pure stamina
Blaze hensey coz I don't blaze amon nah
Man of steel I'm da gangster of lead
Blaze all night so my eyes blood red
All dat crap you said going over my head
I've let you live once not gonna do it again
Cause I'm da cat
You'll better stay clear of
Da cat bad mans be scared of

(REPEAT CHORUS x5)
