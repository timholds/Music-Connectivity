Can you hear me when I'm trapped behind the mirror?
A doppelgänger roaring from my silent kind of furor?

If you're quiet, you can hear the monster breathing…
Do you hear that gentle tapping?
My ugly creature's freezing

And now's he howling, but I'm muted by the horror
How he's everywhere and waiting
Now he's just around the corner

Paranoia backward whispering on my shoulder
Like a wasp is getting nervous, so if I shiver... man, it's over
