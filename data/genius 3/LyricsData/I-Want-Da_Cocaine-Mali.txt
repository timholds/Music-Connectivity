(this shit feel good when you thumbing through this shit right?
Lot of blues
Cocaine Mali)

[Chorus]
I want the wraith, i want the bands ( i want x4)
I want the money to keep touching my hands
I got some shooters that locked up in the feds
Falling out with your nigga thats over a bitch
Just give me the wraith, give me the bands
Im focused on cake, motherfuckers friend
I swear that money keep touching my hands
Free all my shooters thats locked up in the feds

[Verse 1]
I want the wraith, i want the bands i pull up in double cups
Pull up again
I fuck with her but i fucked the friend, i hit two sisters but
Never hit twins
I get so faded when im off the xans
I hit the dice game just lost an advance
She fuck with ballers but say im the man
I wanted ounces but started with grams
I move that white like im in a clan ya
He hating on me but lowkey a fan ya
All of this money keep touching my hands ya
Constantly running and thumbing through bands ya
Im in the kitchen with pots and the pans ya
Pull out the stitches
I do what i want and you do what you can ya
My diamonds wetter im the man ya

[Chorus]
I want the wraith, i want the bands ( i want x4)
I want the money to keep touching my hands
I got some shooters that locked up in the feds
Falling out with your nigga thats over a bitch
Just give me the wraith, give me the bands
Im focused on cake, motherfuckers friend
I swear that money keep touching my hands
Free all my shooters that's locked up in the feds

[Verse 2]
She want to boo up with molly santane ya
I charge a hundred a gram ya
Im really tryna run up them bands ya
Cop a wraith for a benz truck, i want to fuck kylie jenner
Switch to cali for the winter
Benny hunna for dinner
I feel like michael zipa, not for LA but i clipped ha
I just pray you didn't kissed her
Fuck the zell i might forgive ya
Who is this i dont remember
Im not interested in friends
I just me some bands

[Chorus]
I want the wraith, i want the bands ( i want x4)
I want the money to keep touching my hands
I got some shooters that locked up in the feds
Falling out with your nigga thats over a bitch
Just give me the wraith, give me the bands
Im focused on cake, motherfuckers friend
I swear that money keep touching my hands
Free all my shooters that's locked up in the feds
