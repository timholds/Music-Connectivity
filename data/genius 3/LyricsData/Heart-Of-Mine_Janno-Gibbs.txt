One day you may
Find true love that will last
Forever, and ever
Till then you'll spend
A lifetime wishing we're
Together

You never thought
She'd say goodbye
And you will never understand
The reasons why

[Chorus]
Heart of mine
How will you keep from dying
Stop reminiscing
Who is she kissing

Heart of mine
Oh what's the use in trying
No one can mend you now

Hmmm...

Love plays cruel games
You can't believe she's found
Another, lover
Does she miss me
Sometimes you just can't help
But wonder

No you can't stop
The hands of time

[Refrain]
And you will always be the one
She'd left behind

(Repeat Chorus)
(Repeat Refrain)

(Repeat Chorus)
O heart of mine..
Heart of mine..
Oh heart of mine..

Heart of mine
Oh heart of mine
Whats the use of trying
No one can mend you now
