Don't let love hang you up
Don't let it make you sad and blue
Don't let love hang you up
'Cause it won't be long
(Won't be long)
Said it won't be long
(Won't be long)
Before your life is good

Walking around in a world of rage
Somebody just stole your sunshine away
And I know the last thing that you wanna hear from me
Some old dilapidated jive philosophy
But oh, get yourself together
Stop complaining about the weather, hey

And don't let life hang you up
Don't let it make you sad and blue
I said, don't let life hang you up
'Cause it won't be long, well, it won't be long

I know how it feels when your love's gone wrong
You're long faced and lonely but you must be strong
Go out and get yourself all lost in the crowd
Sigh a little, cry a little but for crying out loud
Don't be around looking for sympathy
You won't be able to see the forest for the trees, if you

Don't let life hang you up
I said, don't let it make you sad and blue
Brother, don't let love hang you up
'Cause it won't be long, I said it won't be long
Before your life is

Don't let love hang you up
I said don't let it make you sad and blue
Listen to me, don't let love hang you up
'Cause it won't be long before your life is

Don't let love hang you up
Don't let it make you sad and blue
Don't let love hang you up
