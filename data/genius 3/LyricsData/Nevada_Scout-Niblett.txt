Put on that suit
And lend me that costume
Put on that suit
Get in my car

If we set off now
We'll be there by daybreak

Fifteen hours
And we'll be there
Full fire moon
As our guide

I promised I would
I promised I'd take you
Here I am
With my honor

See you about
See you about
Oh, my love, our Nevada

See you about
See you about
Oh, my love, our Nevada

So put on that suit
And lend me that costume
Let's come home
A little different

Put on that suit
And get in my car
Oh, my love, our Nevada
