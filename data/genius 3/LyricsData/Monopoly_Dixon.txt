Made the man on this instrumental
[Verse 1]
April first nineteen ninety freaking four
Was the day that Ryan Dixon came kicked open the door
Another shy kid with the glasses, barely passing classes
Daydreaming and scheming a plan to entertain the masses
Always picked the lastest, cliché’ Mr Underdog
But then he discovered practice, with a blazing fire to go prove em wrong
I don’t know how to ask this, I’m I still an April Fool though?
If I make a song and move my mom off 17th and Cabrillo?
How’s that for a present, so say my name with reverence
For the skinny black kid who grew up on Nascar and Wrestling, odd
Developed a presence, could be felt from a mile
So he could come a long way from that shy only child
[Bridge]
We love you Cesar (yeah)
I said we love you Cesar
[Hook]
Monopoly, monopoly, we’re taking over as far as the eye can see
Monopoly, monopoly, nobody, nobody on top of me
Monopoly, monopoly, we’re taking over as far as the eye can see
Monopoly, monopoly, nobody, nobody on top of me
[Verse 2]
All of my schools were on the same damn street
So leaving Santa Ana’s gone be bittersweet
Now I’m off to the city, and a man’s gotta eat
And I’ll be back with a couple heads, in a couple weeks, promise
Our music resembles romance, all them after school programs
Taught me fitting in, but no more, they know I’m different
And eating all this knowledge, and I ain’t gone choke
Born on April Fools Day, told my life is a joke
Or to become a shining star, that will shine on down
To every single boy and girl who run n survives in my town, goals
So keep your money, we don’t need alot
The rich kids got the mustangs and we just had the bus stop
[Bridge]
We love you Cesar (We love you man, stand up)
I said we love you Cesar




[Hook]
Monopoly, monopoly, I’m taking over as far as the eye can see
Monopoly, monopoly, nobody, nobody on top of me
Monopoly, monopoly, we’re taking over as far as the eye can see
Monopoly, monopoly, nobody, nobody on top of me
