[Intro: DJ Khaled & Anthony Hamilton]
Keep your circle tight
Trust no one, nobody (nobody, nobody, no no no)
DJ Khaled!

[Verse 1: Scarface]
Gotta be careful who you trusting
Be aware of your surroundings when you hustling
Them niggas smiling at you ain't your friends, dawg
All the real ones are dead or in the pen y'all
You fuck with dude, he your day one
Almost had it all then the day comes
When they walking through your house with the strap out
Pointing at your head, got the bread then you black out (yeah)
Bright lights down the hallways
Left his best friend for dead for the small wage (ay)
They say that every dog's got a day coming
It's like he seen a ghost but he ain't say nothing
Eyes wide shut like you looking at me
Window pane to the soul say they niggas happy
But the pictures say them words we ain't trying to stomach
The homie didn't keep it one hundred
The cops doing roundups, say they got a suspect
Finally got a name now, I'm stunned thinkin fuck that (fuck, that)
For the money, niggas murder what they close to (get this nigga)
Entire families, these motherfuckers ghost you
Smoke you, was it worth what the life was?
Just prepare for the payback cause it strikes cuz
Was it worth what that life was?
Prepare for the payback when it strikes cuz

[Bridge: John Legend]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around
Cold world, cold world

[Verse 2: Jadakiss]
Yo, the pain's unbearable, remains unawareable
He fuck around, jump off a building if you dare him to
The greats they done already killed him, who you compare him to
To really figure out what he said will take a year or two
Family over everything, skills over politics
He don't need the accolades as long as you acknowledge it
Just playing the hand you was dealt, no aces
Betrayal is worse than death in most cases
The world is filled with hypocrites, that's so racist
Multiple shots to the face, no chasers
Mad cause you blew up quick and you excited
Your man that you grew up with get you indicted
This was your nigga, yo, for him you let the trigger go
Found out at the trial they got audio and video
Shit don't always happen how you plan it
Get jammed up and really find out who your fam is
You could feel the picture, you don't need to see the canvas
That nigga Jay'll Hawk you, he don't even play for Kansas
You know when it's someone you love the hurt's pure
You front tryna hold it in, it hurts more
He was right there back-to-back with me, my first war
Even had a crack spot together, the first floor
Used to buzz em in then meet him right by the first door
That was 'prolly a year before I went on my first tour
Friendship was worth more than a couple of ounces
You was 'sposed to be with me arguing with the bouncers
Instead you ended up somewhere far in the mountains
Talking 'about what we was doing, what we was counting
Nothing but old pictures of old sixes
Old BM's with the kits, old Schnitzer's
Two sides, both wishes
Karma is the sister of life, they both bitches

[Bridge: Anthony Hamilton]
See there's a story in my life
There's a story in my pain
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh ohh
There's a story in me

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Yeah, for life
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was chasin' ends
And I'm into makin' money, I ain't into making friends
Cause these niggas rattin', I ain't finna take a chance
Homie said he 'bout that action, they grab him, he take the stand
Damn, say loyalty make a man
Got a homie and he told, I don't even shake his hand
I don't even crack a smile, knew him since a child
Man this game so foul but niggas made vows
To a code I never break, ridin' in the heavyweight
Thirty-six O's in a bird, call it featherweight
Never on time, when I show up I be ready late
Niggas got fat while we starved, they already ate
And I'm trying to get full, masks on, clip full
If he got the money, we attack him like a pit bull
We sellin' soft, we sellin' hard like it's a brick store
On my dick, nigga, thought that's what your bitch for
Hah!

[Bridge: Akon]
My pain ain't never been told (ain't never been told)
All the success that I'm suffering from
Came from this knowledge I sold (this knowledge I know)
My family fucks with me
And fought the enemy that stood in my way (my way)
That's why I don't trust nobody
And I doubt you'll ever see that day

[Hook: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you, which I will never do)

[Bridge: John Legend & Anthony Hamilton]
Cause when you need it the most
Ain't no one ever around (nobody's around)
Cold world (cold world) cold world (mmm, yes it is, yeah)
And the ones that you keep close
Are the ones that'll take you down (always take you down)
Cold world (cooooold) a cold cold world

[Hook: Akon]
'Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you)
Fore I surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender)
Surrender to you (surrender to you, which I will never do)

[Breakdown: Akon & Anthony Hamilton]
Ohh-ohhh ohhh-whooooa
Ohh-ohhhh (ohh-ohhhh) ohh-ohhhhh

[Outro: Anthony Hamilton, Akon & John Legend]
See there's a story in my life (hey) (surrender)
There's a story in my pain (hey) (surrender)
There's a story in my tears, oh-oh ohh (surrender)
There's a story in me
I won't surrender, I won't surrender, ohh no no no
