[Bridge]
I told them youths it's over
See the fire ain't burning no more
I got more straps than a soldier
None of them ain't individuals
Who's that girl? No I don't know her
I ain't even got a short memory
Slewed your boss - since then it was over -
I'm colder - they ain't ready yet
I'm a high roller
Heard a tune called sound boy -
Something crap, they ain't ready yet
Where's my little bro? Subjects delicate
Sit down - I got straps that you will never get
Plus I'm an older and I'm a head of them
Got vocal skills and swagger like them two are never gonna get -
It's over - I'm colder - they ain't ready yet

[Hook]
I'm back doing it like no other
You're off beat it's like you've lost colour
Don't respect life fam', where's my brother?
Yo, I said where's my brother?
If you ever see me on the road duck and cover
Better switch into a runner and run
Wait, where's my brother?
I said where's my brother?
Fam' your times done cause I'm the new boss

[Verse 2]
You're not running cause he's no soldier
Ain't got no hits I will ever cross over
Look around I can't see cannabis
You ain't got bars in a folder
Don't be fooled by Wearing My Rolex
Cause I hit but I'm colder, who's a rover?
He ain't ready yet
Take a look over your shoulder
My MC's army are stars, them man are like cars get burnt- kicked over
Try me now got a new ting
That'll make any small guy flip over
I'm such a world-wide mic man
Might see me doing a show in Toga
I'm colder - they ain't ready yet

[Hook]
I'm back doing it like no other
You're off beat it's like you've lost colour
Don't respect life fam', where's my brother?
Yo, I said where's my brother?
If you ever see me on the road duck and cover
Better switch into a runner and run
Wait, where's my brother?
I said where's my brother?
Fam' your times done cause I'm the new boss
