[Intro]
If tomorrow never comes and I don’t see you again
And I just want you to know that my loving has no end
If tomorrow never comes and I don’t see you again
And I just want you to know that my loving has no end

[Verse One: Emilio Rojas]
Yeah, they say that nothing’s ever promised
Gotta keep the ones around me that are honest
‘Cause there ain’t a guarantee that you gon’ get it ‘cause you want it, right?
And my abeula’s getting old, I need to see her
Before she up and leave us ‘cause she off to meet the reaper
And I don’t wanna lose her ‘fore I really get to know her
I told her that I loved her, I just wanna really show her
My circle getting smaller, every day I’m growing older
I see my fucking breath, I guess my heart is getting colder
They doubt you and then they see your name and crowd around you
The ones that call you fam the ones that care the least about you
If tomorrow never come, I wanna kiss my mom
Maybe find my father and forgive him for the shit he done
Then I find the girls I did the same shit to
And hoping that they would forgive me like how I forgive you, right?
But nothing is for certain, it’s time to take a bow
Yeah, we reached our final curtain

[Hook]
If tomorrow never comes and I don’t see you again
And I just want you to know that my loving has no end
(Tomorrow never comes, tomorrow never comes)
If tomorrow never comes and I don’t see you again
(You sit and you stare at the barrel of a gun)
(Oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah oh oh oh yeah yeah)
And I just want you to know that my loving has no end

[Verse Two: Emilio Rojas]
If tomorrow never comes, I’ll burn the capital
In hoping that the fucking White House will turn to shrapnel
‘Cause politicians use tragedies just to catapult
And launch they own careers, hoping that it make us cast a vote
I find the cast that gave my cousin a taste
They gave my aunt a first taste and then I lay them to waste, right?
I hate to see my family in struggle with addiction
But I’m cool with dope boys, it’s such a fucking contradiction
And if tomorrow never comes, I’ll find religion
Maybe then I’ll find my little half-brother and little sister
I heard my little brother had cancer and didn’t hit him
I was young and the last thing I needed was more commitment
But now he’s in remission so tomorrow got to come for him
We ain’t even spoken and I’m back to feeling numb again
Back to telling every chick I fucked that she the one again
Knowing that I’ll soon be making up for it

[Hook]

[Verse Three: Emilio Rojas]
If tomorrow never comes, I’ll crash a couple cars
Maybe smash a couple broads, shit I’ll probably fuck ‘em raw
‘Cause ain’t no consequences when your world is over with
I snort a couple lines ‘cause I’m sick of living this sober shit
Try to tell my nieces that I loved them and I wished I woulda seen 'em
Instead of beefing with they mother and I tell my older sister
That I’m sorry that I judged her and I should’ve been supportive
Coulda been a better brother and I run into my city, yeah, I run into the Roc
Take my peoples off them corners, take my people off that block
And I go into my school and tell my teachers that I’ve popped
Even though they never thought that I would be shit but a flop
The way that I’m living, I never would know when I’ll be leaving
And when I’mma go, nothing is coming and we never grow
Running to nothing left us broke, yeah so if tomorrow never comes
I want my people knowing that they were the ones I loved
