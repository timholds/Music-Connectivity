[Verse 1]
Long legged women, velvet and lace
A country boy can't help but stare at your face
And I like your outlaw attitude
And I like that long black car
I might just be your ticket out of this old high browed bar
I don't care who you are
Throw me the keys, honey take a seat
I'll show you how to drive that thing
Ride shotgun, with a bootleg sun
Sure to make a city girl scream

[Chorus]
I'm gone take you places money don't go
I'm gone teach you what a country boy know
Gonna cover you in diamonds and dust
Where the stars fall on moonshine road

[Verse 2]
Roll down that window
Let down your fancy hair
Your a long way from New Orleans
Now nobody 'round here cares
Oh, can't you smell that jasmine
Hanging in the air
That's the ghost of old plantations
That burn the hell out there
Ya girl where almost there
Hold on tight, here come the ride
This is where the blacktop ends
Gonna loose those lights, a running blind
You'll never be the same again

[Chorus][x2]

[Bridge]
Long legged women, velvet and lace
A country boy can't help but stare at your face, at your pretty face

[Outro]
Come on
Throw me them keys, let me show you what that caddy'll do baby
Come on
