[Verse 1: Kasland]
Waking up every morning by the crack of dawn
Seeing to it that I'm feeling like I'm acting strong
But these days are the same they just pass it on
To tomorrow then the sorrow is just adding on
So I choose to make a difference, keep attempting til I lift this
Burden from my shoulders and I feel like I have cured the sickness
That is holding me from working for my goals in life
See the problem is that we don't even notice twice
What mistakes we make once we always do it again
Without a conscience children watch us let the new age begin
On a rocky path to failure, it's a true fate of sin
Instead of feeding our addictions, find a new way to win
Cause the next generation takes after the last
Got to stay working hard so I'm not laughing it past
I'm not accustomed to this world so now I'm having a blast
It takes years to build the life then it just happens so fast

[Hook: Daniel Blacktin & Kasland]
Ain't nobody got time to be basic
You only get one shot so you better not waste it
But just trust me bro when I say this
Better learn to stay humble little man I know you're anxious
Game is rigged, just face it
See the evil's in your path there's no way you can erase it
But you can escape the temptation
With your eyes on the prize you can fight the temptation

[Verse 2: Daniel Blacktin]
All these sleepless nights, I need my vice
Got a lot up on my chest, I need advice
Temptation all around me speaking nice
I envision what I'm living with a demon's sight
While this indica aroma
Gets to taking me over
I feel the THC enter me
And free my soul yeah I'm on one, what
That's why I spend money so damn fast
If I see something and I like it, got to have it
That's why I keep wasting all this cash
It comes automatic you would swear that it's a habit
Invest in myself 'til the day it pays off
No frivolous shit, that's because I'm infinite, bitch
Imma keep grinding 'til the day my syndicate rich
Give in to temptation, I ain't giving in shit

[Hook: Daniel Blacktin & Kasland]

[Bridge]
I just want to sing for a big crowd
I just want to start speaking
I just want to make my family proud
I just want to quit drinking
I just want to make it out the hood
I just want to be free
I just want to be the person I should
I just want to be me

[Hook: Daniel Blacktin & Kasland]
