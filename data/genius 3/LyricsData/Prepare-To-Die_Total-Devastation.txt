Prepare now to face your faith
Gather the thought you once forgot
Go to the silent distant voice
Through the gates that will open

Beware now to face your God
There's no one to save you now
Go to the silent distant voice
Through the gates that will open

Prepare your life
Prepare your mind
Prepare now
You are destined to die

The great unknown is your future
There you will go before me
Bleed until your heart says no
It's too late to back down now

Doesn't matter how you feel
Doesn't matter how you will die
It matters how I feel
It matters how I'm gonna kill you

Prepare to die
