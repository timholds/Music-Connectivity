Intro (Method Man sample)
I gotta lotta, I gotta gotta

[Verse 1: Treach]
I gotta chip on my shoulder that Bill Gates ain't make
Gotta connect up in Harlem
Gotta great weight rate
Gotta hotta enchilada
Gotta hot tre 8
Heavy rocks in my rings that a quake can't shake
Or she can freak
You a freak let's fuck
Keep a freak for a week
Fuck a stunt for a month
Gotta brand hot damn and a great rapper flow
Gotta actual factual international after glow
Tools for ya fools trying to fix some ish
Got talent more gifted than a Christmas list
Got dibs on many things, so I ride east west
Gotta list who's best so I stress why guess
Gotta lotta hot material real on the set
Got ass in first class bust some head on the jet
Got an album, we wildin', so we ride don't rest
Got kids, a gang of niggas I call a Tribe Called Treach

[Chorus: Treach & (Sonny Black)]
I got Henney, I got sizzurp
I got dinner, I got dessert
(I got goons in the hood with cases
Cone head hoodies and they rocks grew faces)
I got this side, I got that side
I gotta a big bag baby full of bitch better act right
(I got wolves on deck all about they hood
Bangin' out and they ain't neva been about they hood)

[Verse 2]
I gotta way of findin' niggas, so these assholes hide
Gotta brigade sun to shade so my brass shows pride
Got Jimmy more for demmy that'll smash your bride
Half-truths will lodge your ass or lose a whole half side
Gotta...shit on these fools, so I crap for a hobby
Make you O'neil (kneel) for real stack my shack (Shaq) with the shotties
Got vultures freaks for me, they can slobby the knobby
You ain't fuckin' get the truck and meet and greet in the lobby
Got classics, whole lotta doe from the past yo
A hot gun on the run, need your basement to crash hoe
Recession, still rappin' but I'm jackin' for cash flow
Wanna waste time then go outside and watch some grass grow
Got spears for your fears, but I ain't Britney
Gotta name in this game cause my aim game's pretty
Gotta squad, word to God cause it's rough in the city
Smooth as silk, I got milk if you a gotta couple of titties

[Chorus: Treach & (Sonny Black)]
I got Henney, I got sizzurp
I got dinner, I got dessert
(I got goons in the hood with cases
Cone head hoodies and they rocks grew faces)
I got this side, I got that side
I gotta a big bag baby full of bitch better act right
(I got wolves on deck all about they hood
Bangin' out and they ain't neva been about they hood)

[Verse 3]
I gotta ditch the bitch call the gravel hail
Stitch the snitch tell her to sails or wail on the tattle tale
Tuck your tail when the battle fails
Keep a bitch with a fatter tail
There's beef when the cattle yells
I'm the shit like into John Lennon
Spit venom, my women and my denim are gremlin
Gotta family full of fugitives
Gotta shoot my way from a felony know what the future is
That's the moral of the story horror for ya
Like Kalashnikov southside of Tora Bora
Wanna score da border
Gotta gracious gorgeous
Many semi auto
Sweep your timbs and torso
Gotta bitch with the Porsche though
Got it twisted and braided, if not then keep the horse fro
Don't fuss, take your bitch back
Imma show if you walk over tough you gonna limp back

[Chorus: Treach & (Sonny Black)]
I got Henney, I got sizzurp
I got dinner, I got dessert
(I got goons in the hood with cases
Cone head hoodies and they rocks grew faces)
I got this side, I got that side
I gotta a big bag baby full of bitch better act right
(I got wolves on deck all about they hood
Bangin' out and they ain't neva been about they hood)
