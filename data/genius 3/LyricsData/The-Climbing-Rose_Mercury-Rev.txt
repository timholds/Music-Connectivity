Lover lift me up, high enough
To see the star of gold in the heart of the climbing rose

An how she knows, what to hold
An what to leave behind, but close
And how come I don't
How come I don't

Lover let me see
Where she finds
The strength to rise
Above the weeds and other plants
And how come I can't
How come I can't

Lover lift me up...
Oh come and lift me up

Lover let me go
Let me see
Just how it feels, to bloom, all by yourself
Oh I know I can
Oh you know I can

Lover lift me up...
High enough...
To see the star of gold in the heart of the climbing rose

Lover lift me up...
High enough...
To see the star of gold in the heart of the climbing rose

Lover lift me up...

Lover lift me up...(lover lift me up)
Lover lift me up...(lover lift me up)
Lover lift me up...(lover lift me up...)
