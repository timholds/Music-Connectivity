MELT DOWN BESIDE ME
I MELT BESIDE YOU
ALWAYS I MELT WITH YOU

TEN THOUSAND LANDS
SINK INTO PITS OF THEIR OWN
ALL MOUNTAINS SLIDE
TO KEEP THE DRY ON THE STONE
THAT DRY WILL WET
AND THE LIGHT WILL EXPLODE
WITH CLOUDS AND ASH
DON'T LET ME GO

DARK DESERT SKY
ONE MILLION YEARS OLD
THE MOON APPEARS
NO ONE CAN IGNORE
THE PLANTS KNOW WHY
WE'VE COME TO EXPLORE
THE NIGHT'S ALIVE
AS FIRES UNFOLD
