[Hook: Azizi Gibson]
We going up up and away
Money, ballin'
Always stylin'
Want it, got it
Okay, buy it
Cause a, riot
Nigga, quiet
Gotta try
Get the fuck from out my face
Pull up, pop up
She a starter
Don't get caught up
You a baller
Aim smarter
Keep your feet up
I'm sorry that's my motherfucking ego

[Verse 1: Azizi Gibson]
I wanna grow up getting guwop
Boy, I would rather die than put you on
I've worked too hard for the mula
I used to live abroad with the cool ones
I feel like a star when it's lit up
So you know there's plenty hoes in the picture
Nah, we won't tell a soul, my nigga
Your story's getting old, go figure

[Bridge: Azizi Gibson]
I was sent to find you niggas
(I was sent to find all of you)
I'm here to remind you niggas
(I'm here to remind all of you, yeah) (I'm the Reaper)
I was sent to find you niggas
(I'm here to, here to, here to, here to)
Here to remind you niggas
I'm the Reaper

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
That ballin' shit I been about since a youngin on the corner
Watching them old school cars, go creepin' by
Like I need one when I'm on it
Playin' the field, tryna come up on a mil'
Visible set with the grill
Crackin' the seal, pour this champagne till it's spilled
Tell them bitches how I feel
Nothin' gon' hold me back
Fuck them niggas never cut them slack
Know my worth and go and double that
Never let my feelings get attached
Keep it one hundred from the start
Always get the money a la carte
Separate from the haters and the bitches
Cause I made a move, and I made it far, and I made a mark
And they devestated cause I'm elevated
Bought the section and they never made it
Red carpet, dreamin' on a hoe
See it, buy it then I let it show
Bust a band and I let it go
Bust a band and I throw some more
Want a thoroughbred for the steelo
That fell in love with my ego
