When love takes hold again
Controlling how you feel
About me, about men
I've got these friends who
Mimic flowers forever in my way
And dance on their enormity
Like celebration day
So innocently similar
You can't tell them apart
That weight so heavy on my heart

Cos they've been here for years
Friends of mine, white feathers
Collecting dust with tears
Making mine, white feathers

Confess to me expose
A pair of snowy white
Illusive shadows and all it takes is...
One more shot and then down I go my lady
Down I go just maybe down I go my lady
One more shot and then down I go my lady
Down I go just maybe down I go my lady

They've been here for years
Friends of mine, white feathers
Collecting dust with tears
Making mine, white feathers

One more shot and then down I go...
One more shot and then down I go...

One more shot and then down I go my lady
Down I go just maybe down I go my lady
One more shot and then down I go my lady
Down I go just maybe down I go
One more shot and then down I go my lady
Down I go just maybe down I go my lady
One more shot and then down I go my lady
Down I go just maybe down I have to go

Cos they've been here for years
Friends of mine, white feathers
Collecting dust with tears
Making mine, white feathers
They've been here for years
Friends of mine, white feathers
Collecting dust with tears
Making mine, white feathers...
