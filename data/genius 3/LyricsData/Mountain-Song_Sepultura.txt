Comin' down the mountain
One of many children
Everybody has their own opinion
Everybody has their own opinion
Holding it back
And it hurts so bad
Jumping out of my flesh
And I said, no
Cash in
Cash in now, honey
Cash in now
Cash in now, baby
Cash in now, honey
Cash in Miss Smith
Cash in now, baby

I was comin' down the mountain
And met a child, she had pin eyes
We had the same opinion
Had the same opinion
She was holding it back
And it hurts so bad
Jumping out of her flesh
And I said, no
You better cash in
Cash in now, honey
Cash in now
Cash in now, baby
Cash in now, honey
Cash in Miss Smith
Cash in now, baby
