Sunday night, sunday night, the killer of the week
Sunday night, sunday night, the killer of the week
Sunday night...
I've finally found, I've finally found
Something to plug up this snorry mouth

Since the day she said to me (she saw slee smore)
This house moves more than you (show so snow)
So I tell her I sleep (so so still snore)
To keep from thinking it through (bless me)
Now it's all I can do (shovel snow)
When you pull the sheets up overhead (sometimes so you know)
And she sends me out
To shove snow drifts in my bed (she sings sun she snore)

You'll reach for the door, arms feel weak
You'll make a mistake and fly fly ahead
And it's all I can do when you pull the sheets up overhead
And send me out to shove snow drifts in my bed

Today she said to me (sneer snore seer soar)
Wanna get even with you more (sneer snore seer soar)
So I tell her she can (so show sea shore)
Even more than before (full mouth sneer roar)

You'll reach for the door and your arms feel weak
You'll make a mistakeand fly fly ahead
And it's all I can do when you pull the sheets up overhead
And send me out to shove snow drifts in my bed
I've finally found, I've finally found
Something to plug up this snorry mouth

(?) see the sight
(?) posts around my bed, you thrust up and down
Arms around my head, pressures not mine
Both in spirit and time whisper wine

I've finally found, I've finally found
Something to plug up this snorry mouth

So I bet she says to me (so show sneer snore)
Need to see to my side (seal the sown shear stone)
But by the time I made the bed (sneer snore sheer shore)
Till you made up your mind (so, so, so, so)

You'll reach for the door, arms feel weak
You'll make a mistake and fly fly ahead
And it's all I can do when you pull the sheets up overhead
And send me out to shove snow drifts in my bed
I've finally found, I've finally found
Something to plug up this snorry mouth
I've finally found, I've finally found
Something to plug up this snorry mouth
This snorry mouth, this snorry mouth
This snorry mouth, this snorry mouth
This snorry mouth, this snorry mouth
This snorry mouth, this snorry mouth
This snorry mouth, this snorry mouth
This snorry mouth, this snorry mouth
This snorry mouth, this snorry mouth
This snorry mouth, this snorry mouth
