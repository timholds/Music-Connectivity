[Verse]
I get down with music and guitars
I fool around with all kinds of fast cars
It takes you baby to keep my motor running
I smoke the tires and watch the rubber burn
It takes your fire to make my wheels turn
Make my blood run hot and keeps my heart a humming
But you're love don't take a back-seat to nothing
Temptation always knocking
Get three behind me 'cause I ain't stopping
Baby you're all I need and whole lot more
Rocking and rolling out here on the fast lane
It can get crazy, downright insane
Burning down the highway to your front door
But you're love don't take a back-seat to nothing
My baby's really something
She keeps my motor running
Her love don't take a back-seat
Temptation always knocking
Get three behind me 'cause I ain't stopping
Baby you're all I need and whole lot more
But you're love don't take a back-seat to nothing
