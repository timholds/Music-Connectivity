Hey, up in the backwoods, down in the holler
Old boys feelin' like a dog on a collar
Keepin' that chain pulled tight
Waitin' on Saturday night

Put on the smell-good, put on skinner'n
Head into to town like a NASCAR winner
Cruisin' back an' forth to the Tasty-Freeze
Everywhere you look, all you see...

Is hillbilly deluxe, slick pick-up trucks
Big timin' in a small town
Stirrin' it up right about sundown
Black denim an' chrome to the bone with a little home grown
A country girl cuddled up...
Hillbilly deluxe

Yeah, couple cute sweet things drivin' a fastback
Shoot 'em a cool smile hopin' that they smile back
"Hey, Baby, what's you name?"
Burn a little rubber when the red lights change

Here come the blue lights, here come Barney
Hot on the beer, y'all, let's move the party
Gotta go, but that's all right...
Do it all again next Friday night

Hillbilly deluxe, slick pick-'em-up trucks
Big timin' in a small town
Stirrin' it up right about sundown
Black denim an' chrome to the bone with a little home grown
Country girl cuddled up...
