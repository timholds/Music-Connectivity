She's a freeway flower
She knows how to move
Growing up in a part of town
You've only heard about
But she's different
And you will remember
If she smiles it will knock you
Right out
Cause she's seen more
Than you ever imagined
And maybe that's what
It's all about
Caught between the brights
And a twilight sky
Shattering your heart
With the spark in her eye
Feel the chills
Coming down your spine
She's walking with ease
While trucks roll by
We're looking at her
She's a freeway flower
It's not gonna be
It's not gonna be
An easy ride for you
She's been fighting
All her brothers
Not gonna take any bullshit
From you
But she's different
And you will remember
If she smiles it will knock you
Right out
Cause she's seen more
Than you ever imagined
And that's what it's all about
Caught between the brights
And a twilight sky
Shattering your heart
With the spark in her eye
Feel the chills
Coming down your spine
She's walking with ease
While trucks roll by
We're looking at her
She's a freeway flower
I'd do anything to be the reason
That could bring out her smile
Once again
Somehow the flowers
In well kept gardens
Don't make me feel that way
Caught between the brights
And a twilight sky
Shattering my heart with the
Spark in her eye
Well I can feel the chills coming
Down my spine
She's walking with ease while
Trucks roll by
Looking at you
You're a freeway flower
