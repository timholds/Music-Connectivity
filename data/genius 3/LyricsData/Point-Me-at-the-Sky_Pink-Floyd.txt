[Verse One: David Gilmour]
Hey Eugene, this is Henry McClean
And I've finished my beautiful flying machine
And I'm ringing to say
That I'm leaving and maybe
You'd like to fly with me
And hide with me, baby

[Verse Two: David Gilmour]
Isn't it strange how little we change?
Isn't it sad we're insane?
Playing the games that we know end in tears
The games we've been playing for thousands and thousands and thousands and...

[Bridge One: Roger Waters]
Jumps into his cosmic flyer
Pulls his plastic collar higher
Light the fuse and stand right back
He cried, "This is my last goodbye"

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly

[Verse Three: David Gilmour]
And if you survive till two thousand and five
I hope you're exceedingly thin
For if you are stout you will have to breathe out
While the people around you breathe in, breathe in, breathe in, breathe in...

[Bridge Two: Roger Waters]
People pushing on my sides
Is something that I hate
And so is sitting down to eat
With only little capsules on my plate

[Chorus: David Gilmour]
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it fly
(Point me at the sky and let it fly)
Point me at the sky and let it

[Bridge Three: Roger Waters]
And all we've got to say to you is goodbye
It's time to go, better run and get your bags, it's goodbye
Nobody cry, it's goodbye

[Outro: Roger Waters](8x)
Crash, crash, crash, crash, goodbye
