Oh my God
Oh my God, why?
Oh my God, why?
Why?

[Verse 1: Alt-j]
I want to do all the things your lungs do so well
I'm gonna bed into you like a cat beds into a bean bag
Turn you inside out to lick you like a crisp packet
(Turn you inside out to lick you)

Ooooh, devour me
Ooooh, Lou Lou, let the cover girls sing

[Bridge: Alt-j]
I want every other freckle...

Ooooh, Lou Lou, let the cover girls sing

[Verse 2: Alt-j]
I want to be every button you press
And all mouths that surround you
Yes, I'm gonna roll around you
Like a cat rolls around the chrysanthemums
I'm gonna kiss you like the sun grounds you
(I'm gonna kiss you like the sun grounds you)

[Bridge: Alt-j]
I want every other freckle...

[Hook: Alt-j]
Devour me
Let the cover girls sing!
