[Intro: DJ Dibia$e]
The kings is back, mayne
We back for SXSW 2015
We took 2014 off but we back, mayne
B4SXSW...

[Verse: Big KRIT (voice screwed)]
Still waiting on my just due
Candy paint, got it oak blue
On the outside looking inside...
At these non-believers hollering, "fuck you!"
Cause they ain't playa, barely paid
Working 9-5 just to scrape some change
While I was flexin' chrome, with a yellow bone
With a fat ass, [?] face
Slid in the pussy like a cross fader
And jigged in it like all day
No love lost, my team floss
We gon' break 'em off, 'til we all paid
And that's word to Steve-O, [?]
Big Sant and Smoke DZA
Multi til' the sun die
Fuck if you don really fuck with it
That fake love don't mean shit
Talking about we been partners
Matter of fact you ain't got to spin my records
I sell out shows and make [?]
And it make sense, fuck what you heard
[?]
I kill songs 'til the beats gone
And hold a memorial service like right after
Another chapter, another topic
Your personality is so out of pocket
My bank account like, "I'm too full."
Your bank account like, "You need to stop it."
It's just a hobby, you ain't getting bread
Just a dream if there's no cream
You wake up starving
I wake up calling
For a bitch to feed me like Akeem
Watching Pain in Full on 5 screens
Franchise with like 5 rings
Dope enough to kill 5 fiends
And you done played along for 5 teens
And that’s on the real
Show my grill
Pop my trunk and one finger whip
Bangin' Screw like, "What it do?"
A Mississippi Pimp with some Texas shiiit!
Believe that there
Make it where a bad bitch need that there
Fuck the world and bust a nut in her
And tell that bitch she can see that there
On the front of Forbes, gonna' G' that there
And that broke shit I had to leave that there
Hit the lot with my old school
But that funk, I need that there
That's no lie, I got to feed the fam'
I do it for the south
You do it for the gram
We ain't the same so I understand
If you fall off
And are never seen again
And that's tough luck but thats how it be
My trunk banging at ‘em with Sicily
I swear if aliens came down with fleets
It’s cause my subwoofer phoned E.T
The boy sounding like a space modulator
Innovator so they had to see
I'm knocking pictures off the wall at the white house
My neon shining with the lights out
We got to fuck, get my dick sucked
Tell her suck slow and don’t bite down
Too exclusive, too vicious
I bought a three story like this ain't expensive
[?] doing hella shows
I couldn’t hit the gym, I was on the road
Didn’t lift weights
Eatin' made steak
But impressive bands kept my pockets swoll'
Tell her bust it open like the optimo
Watching out for these jealous snakes
Cause niggas slither
When you’re clocking figures
[?]
Like a two year old
When I’m throwing cake
Grab a hand full
And mush it in your face, bitch
I'm still clocking figures
Working wheels like 9 to 5
Chopping these blades everyday...
B4SXSW

[Chorus]
South by Southwest (x6)

[Outro: DJ Dibia$e]
Hey we got the soundcheck for you right here...
Before SXSW 2015
The mixtape
DJ Dibia$e, the million dollar DJ
I’m back, mayne
You know I been wrecking SXSW for like 5-6 years now
You know what I mean?
I took last year off
But real niggas had to come back
We had show up and show out
