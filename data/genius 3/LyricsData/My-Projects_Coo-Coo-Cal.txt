[Music Video Intro]
Cal why is you so lazy?
You was supposed to went and gone and picked it up for me two hours ago!
Damn you don't do nothing for me!

[Hook]
In my project (5x)

[Verse 1]
Dawg my project is sweetin
But if you ain't from where I'm from, like some dawg
Don't come or you gettin beatin
Yeah we cheatin dog that's automatic
We greedy, plus we try'n feed the needy dawg wit all the cabbage
Steal from the rich and give to the poor
We sell a few drugs, bust a few slugs, and pimp a few hoes
Don't let us find a bit in higgity
Dawg we turn them into stiggidies
With shorties off in riggidies
So if you ain't from here or wit my guys
Don't even roll thru playa cuz all the traffic gettin minimized
Cries for help cuz you got carjacked
Niggas roll for a minute then pass it to the hypes to sell the car back
And once she get it, it be stripped down
Thugs, they got your system and your dubs and want your crib now
Ya'll betta give the hood respect
Cuz it pay to play for a day up in my projects

[Hook]
In my projects, my project thick
In my projects, everybody cooks bricks
In my projects, my projects thick
Don't come to my projects if you ain't with this clique
In my projects, my project thick
In my projects, everybody cooks bricks
In my projects, my projects thick
Don't come to my projects if you ain't with this clique

[Verse 2]
Now let me tell you bout them kingpins
Droppin Y2K Benz on them rims, bringin 15 in
They dishin it out, they keep it in circulation
They dodgin the Fedz, and suckas is playa hatin
They got the whole hood stacked up
And now the po's walkin on the showroom floor buyin 'Lac Trucks
They stuck in the ghetto by choice
But if they go, it's jacuzzis and condos, with a Rolls Royce
Now voice your opinion
You heard about the 'War On Drugs'
Now won't you tell me who you think winnin
Spendin money by the piles throwin dubs
On the 'burbans with the subs
And they twerkin bumpin Coo Coo Cal
And the hood love hoodrats
On the bus-stop shakin it like it's hot with some good cat
Ya'll betta give the hood respect
Cuz it pay to play for a day up in my projects

[Hook]
In my projects, my project thick
In my projects, everybody cooks bricks
In my projects, my projects thick
Don't come to my projects if you ain't wit dis clique
In my projects, my project thick
In my projects, everybody cooks bricks
In my projects, my projects thick
Don't come to my projects if you ain't wit dis clique

[Verse 3]
Dawg, go on and sum it up between the grind with dimes
Crimes and rhymes, ya'll we comin up
From sundown to sun-up, ha
The block watch, peekin out the attic in case you run up
Wit diamonds and furs, he's and her's
Shoppin sprees with ease to fill up a 2000 Suburb, ha
Dawg my projects got taste
Although the rent ain't nuthin but two-fifty
We sportin five thousand dollar drapes
Makin it happen, wit snappin to avoid that - anchor
Hook me up with plenty tracks to keep a playa rappin
So put my city on the map
Hook me up wit million dollar vocal cords
I can afford a million on a track
You do the addin and subtractin
Wastin time just to figure out, without a doubt, that we stackin
Ya'll betta give the hood respect
Cuz it pay to play for a day up in my projects

[Hook]
In my projects, my project thick
In my projects, everybody cooks bricks
In my projects, my projects thick
Don't come to my projects if you ain't wit dis clique
In my projects, my project thick
In my projects, everybody cooks bricks
In my projects, my projects thick
Don't come to my projects if you ain't wit dis clique

In my projects (*repeat 5x until end of song*)
