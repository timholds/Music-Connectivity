[Verse 1]
Emily tries but misunderstands (ah ooh)
She's often inclined to borrow somebody’s dreams 'til tomorrow

[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let’s try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

[Verse 2]
Soon after dark, Emily cries (ah ooh)
Gazing through trees in sorrow, hardly a sound 'til tomorrow

[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play

[Verse 3]
Put on a gown that touches the ground (ah ooh)
Float on a river forever and ever, Emily (Emily)

[Chorus]
There is no other day
Let's try it another way
You’ll lose your mind and play
Free games for May
See Emily play
