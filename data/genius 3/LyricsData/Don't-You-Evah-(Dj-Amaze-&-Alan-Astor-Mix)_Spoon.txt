Bet you got it all planned right
Bet you never worry
Never even feel a fright
Bet you got it all planned right
Never think to worry
Never even feel a fright

Single sleeps alone
And I know you don't really mind
Five years by your side
So I know you really don't mind

But don't you never be down
I said don't ever
'Cause it's gonna keep 'em hanging around

Never be down
I said don't ever
Because it's gonna keep 'em hanging around

Don't you never think it's right
Bet you think you had to but it doesn't feel right
Bet you never think it feels right
Famous-sounding words make your head feel light

Petals getting picked
With the love-yous
And the love-you-nots

Five years going by
Everyone is staying on their side

But don't you never be down
I said don't ever
Because you're gonna keep 'em hanging around

Never be down
I said don't ever
Because it's gonna keep 'em hanging around

But don't you never be down
I said don't ever
Because it's gonna keep 'em hanging around

Five years going by
Everyone is staying on their side

Never be down
I said don't ever
Cause it's gonna keep 'em hanging around

Five years going by
Everyone is staying on their side

I said don't ever need to worry
Cause it's gonna feel all right

Never
