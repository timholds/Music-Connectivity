[Verse 1]
He doesn't want your love
But he can't say goodbye
He's begging you to stay
But he can't tell you why
You finally made your move
Your hand is on the door
You know the rest is hard
You've been this far before

[Chorus]
Don't look back now
He's going to see you crying
You'll turn around
It happens everytime
That look will always break you down
Don't look back now

[Verse 2]
You pick your suitcase up
You hear him call your name
You'd give your soul to him
If things could be the same
You stop and close your eyes
You grab some memories
You think of better days
But that's all history

[Chorus]
