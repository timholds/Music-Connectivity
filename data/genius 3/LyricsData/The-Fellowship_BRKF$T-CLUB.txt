Sometimes the mission be impossible when your battling defeat

[Fonz-E Mak]
Man gone do it just cause we asked you to

Cause we the ones who gone go from local to global
We so loco with vocals
And delivery and flow so insane they calling us postal boy
Decided long ago that rhyming is the only road
I’m making sure nobody sleeping on me less they comatose
Never been a friend of beef Criss Angel with the spitting g
That’s why all my enemies disappearing like Kennedys

[Legit]
Soon as they drive by that grassy knoll
I’m in that schoolbook depository
Now you know
Metaphorically of course cause well
Its Mr. nasty flow
Hungry like Kobe with a nappy fro
That’s why my hat be low
Because im Danny Ocean they think I can’t get a deal now
Cause I don’t dress flashy you saying I don’t appeal now?
How you faggots trying judge me?
The fuck is you Uncle Phil now?
You nothing but a magnet to niggas that pull the steal out

[Calez]
Pop them niggas and peal out, uurrrrrkk
Floor it until the fucking tires start to squeal out, skuuurrtt
Visit my psychiatrist and tell her I ain’t on, dirrrt
Bitch say I’m lying denying the facts
A fucking tyrant in fact
Sold my crack to tracks and now you bitches is buying it back
Showed that ageusia how it taste now they dying for that
Pause for the lions of raps
King of the jungle running the rally
I’m sickly killing the valley
You Ricky up in the alley, run

[Johnny St. Cloud]
So it’s no more Mr. Nice Guy, good evening mufuckers’
All you mama boys can
Try, so good luck you mother lovers
And suckers and losers
Posers and Boozers
You just gone cruise for bruisin’
So stop playing pick and choose when I ain't got shit to lose
But hella got shit to prove
Who the fuck is you tryna’ move
To Rumplestilskins ain’t even nowhere to close to the crew

[Julian Malone]
