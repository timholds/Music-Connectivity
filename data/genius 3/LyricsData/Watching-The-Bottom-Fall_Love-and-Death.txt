[Verse 1]
You say it's criminal
(It's not criminal)
I say it's logical
(It's logical)
I said my last "no thank you"
(Where do we go from here?)
We trust the same lies, trust the same things
Justify the crime

[Hook]
(Watch it falling)
What is it for?
Watching the bottom fall
Watching you burn it all
And will we learn again?
And will it hurt forever?
Watching the bottom fall

Fall

[Verse 2]
You say I'm cynical
(You say, I say)
You're hypocritical
(I say...)
I said my last "no thank you"
(I thought I made it clear)
We trust the same lies, trust the same things
Justify the crime

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I don't have energy for you
I don't have energy to see this through
I don't have energy for you
I don't have energy, can we be through!

I'm through with you [X5]

[Hook]
