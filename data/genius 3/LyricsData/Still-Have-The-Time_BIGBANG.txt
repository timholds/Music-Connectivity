It is big and blue
He's been carrying it through
Years and years of disappointment
Now there's nothing more to do
Face down in the gutter you will see no stars
And it won't take him very long he's falling down
And you may realize

You still have the time
You still have the time to make it right
You still have the time
You still have the time to make it right

He's walking home from a show
Were no-one would know
If he really played, and now he's playing in the snow
Making and Angel that could lift him up
And it won't take them very long
They're going up, the world is turning

You still have the time
You still have the time to make it right
You still have the time
You still have the time to make it right

He would pick up speed
He'd be in the lead
Falling with the parts of spaceships
Launched back in 1981
Blown up on purpose what a lot of fun
And it won't take him very long
He'll fall down and you may realize
