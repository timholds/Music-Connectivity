Make some noise if you're with me
Come on y'all, make some noise if you're with me
Make some noise if you're with me
Make some noise if you're with me

It's like that y'all, and it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We 'bout to go to the top, y'all
Hip-hop hu, to the top hu

It's like that y'all, and it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We 'bout to go to the to the to the
To the to the to the to the

The anticipation arose as time froze
I stared off the stage with my eyes closed and dove
Into the deep cosmos
The impact pushed back, twenty five rows

But before the raw live shows, come on I'se a little snot-nosed
Rockin' Gazelle, goggles and Izod clothes
Learnin' the ropes of ghetto survival
Peepin' out the situation I had to slide through

Had to watch my back my front plus my sides too
But when it came to gettin' mine I ain't tryin', to argue
Sometimes I wouldn'ta made it if it wasn't for you
Hip-hop, you the love of my life and that's true

When I was handlin' the shit I had to do
It was all for you, from the door for you
Speak through you, gettin' paper on tour for you
From the start, thought was down by law for you

I used to hit up every corner store wall for you
We ripped shit, and kept it hardcore for you
I remember late nights, steady rockin' the mic
Hip-hop, you the love of my life

Tell the people like that y'all, that y'all
And it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We 'bout to take it to the top
To the top, to the top, to the top, to the top
To the top, to the top, to the top, check it out

It's like that y'all, and it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We 'bout to go to the to the to the
To the to the to the to the
To the to the to the to the
To the to the to the to the check it out

Yo, yo I was speakin', to my guy 'Riq and
How she was desperately seekin' to organize in a confusion
Usin', no protection, told her on resurrection
Caught in the Hype Williams, and lost her direction

Gettin' ate in sections where I wouldn't eat her
An under the counter love, so silently I treat her
Her daddy'll beat her, eyes all Puffed
In the mix on tape, niggas had her in the buff

When we touch, it was more than just a fuck
The Police, in her I found peace, like who?
Like Malcolm in the East, seen her on the streets of New York, trickin' off
Tried to make a hit with her but my dick went soft

Movin' weight, losin' weight, not picky with who she choose to date
To confuse the hate, with her struggle I relate
Close to thirty, most of the niggas she know is dirty
Havin' more babies than Lauryn, she started showin' early

As of late I realized, that this is her fate
Or destiny that brings the best of me it's like God is testin' me
In retrospect I see she brought life and death to me
Peace to us collectively, live and direct when we perform

It's just coffee shop chicks and white dudes
Over her I got into it with that nigga Ice Cube
Now the fight moved to in life, makin' the right moves
Besides God and family, you my life's jewel

Like that y'all, and it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We 'bout to go to the top, y'all
Hip-hop hu, to the top hu
Hip-hop hu

It's like that y'all, and it sounds so nice
Hip-hop, you the love of my life
We 'bout to go to the to the to the
To the to the to the to the
To the to the to the to the
To the to the to the to the
