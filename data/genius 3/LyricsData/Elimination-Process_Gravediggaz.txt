[Intro: Aleem]
Grym Reaper, your mission is to take control of the black hole perimeter and to eliminate the fake, death, dumb and blind niggas
You must by any means necessary annihilate the meek zombie ghetto dwellers
Now General, since you've accepted this hazardous mission
You and your team will be equipped with special weapons
Unleashing this force will create devastating consequences
The normal equator of this weapon is pure sonic energy
Blasted through the lonics chamber and the palm of your hand
Use this force wisely, seek and destroy the enemy
But preserve the niggettes
Do your duty soldier

[Chorus 1: Poetic]
Ghettos are becoming lost
Shorties is outta their minds
If not for the courage of a chosen few
They stay dumb, deaf and blind

[Chorus 2: Poetic]
Caught in the process of elimination
Until your fortress is vacant
Losses are taken, mindstates are shaken
Until our forces awaken
Caught in the process of elimination
Until your fortress is vacant
Losses are taken, mindstates are shaken
Till our forces awake

[Verse 1: Poetic]
General Grym
What's the pressure principle? Attack the enemies at every interval
And keep our casualties at a minimal
Camouflaged down now I launch my offensive
To Arm Leg-a Leg the defenseless
Cause criminals and dons are relentless
Murders are common and senseless
In the ghetto trenches the stench is tremendous
In poverty, our property is defended
By shotguns, alarm pit bulls and barbwire fences
If you're not armed you're in harm's way
You're hunted by wannabe desperados and hombres
I'm sick of all this shit, rappers defeating me
On oscillating frequencies, speaking about operating frequently
With ki's from Colombians and Dominicans
You silly men, traitors, snakes and reptilians
Niggas act like dumb animals in pit bull and cock fights
Attacking each other then carjacking at stop lights
Fuck all you cold blooded race killers
That's proud to be blood spillers of ebony pillars
Black devils are worse than those of the cursed seed
Foes better check their approach me the first G
R-Y-M, you know the name
I'm hated by the beast like the Feds hate Saddam Hussein
Positive brothers ain't got to be soft
It's time to start knocking you fake niggas off, what?

[Chorus' 1&2: Poetic]
Ghettos are becoming lost
(Caught in the process of elimination
Until your fortress is vacant)
Shorties is outta they minds
If not for the courage of a chosen few
(Losses are taken, mind states are shaken)
They stay dumb deaf and blind
(Till our forces awaken)
Ghettos are becoming lost
(Caught in the process of elimination
Until your fortress is vacant)
Shorties is outta they minds
If not for the courage of a chosen few
(Losses are taken, mind states are shaken)
They stay dumb deaf and blind
(Till our forces awake)

[Verse 2: Frukwan]
Feeler of the grace as your body tone get laced
You and I must verse to coincide our universe
Relevance yo true that, prepare for the risks
No handout, I chop your fucking hand off from the wrist
I detect the vibes weak brothers try to hide
Inside, they ain't strapped for the ride, it's suicide
I spread like a fungus, ran the Devil from among us
Let the rain in the days in the valley of Columbus
The all-natural cosmetic, supernatural genetic
My genes, by all means, they backpass synthetics
Rhetoric, car, weed, bare blunts and cigarettes
Sexist directors, crossdress infectors
Spawn of a form of newborns who ain't warned of the wicked
The Devil's technician, the division
And smash into grains of sand from the hourglass

[Verse 3: Shabazz the Disciple]
I hear rumors of war
Enter gun shooter celestial soldier from the future
The Tribe of Judah, Twelve Tribe saluter
Marching with an army of extraterrestrial beings
Descended from celestial peons, been fighting the holy war for eons
Wise words that guided missiles, Yacub play with steel
Gods use mental pistols and Ezekiel's wheel
The apocalypse converting this metropolis
To a necropolis, war of Armageddon acropolis
Novus ordo seclorum, Babylon's the forum
The black mind and spirit is at hand I'm fighting for 'em
A holy war with the beast with the 7 heads
It's your Last Supper, feast on this unleavened bread

[Break]
"All personnel involved in this ghetto warfare
Proceed to Area 51
Do not let the enemy into your sector
Block the perimeter, yo"

[Verse 4: Omen]
At triple dark minds should not aim the rhyme laser
Beems make it weak, beings screams for their fake
Unseen racist, your face traitors, face elimination
And escape the bad disaster's path for aftermath
I laughed and blast have mad people's units
Weak mind created crime-related rise, can't fuck with my blueprints
Stupid, the end is near while fools give up the youth
Yapping force action they gat clapping guns and beer
Beer is done skunks and fear the other knotty set up
To killers, you fake thug niggas shut the hell up
I'm fed up so I develop the ill scheme to envelop
These bitch teen sweated up black devil vessels
I'll dead you with lethal style evil ogre
Slash demon cobra in these last days a scientist take over
With this Elimination Process
You pathetic brainwashed niggas don't test the niggettes

[Chorus: Poetic]
Ghettos are becoming lost
(Caught in the process of elimination
Until your fortress is vacant)
Shorties is outta they minds
If not for the courage of a chosen few
(Losses are taken, mind states are shaken)
They stay dumb deaf and blind
(Til our forces awaken)
Ghettos are becoming lost
(Caught in the process of elimination
Until your fortress is vacant)
Shorties is outta they minds
If not for the courage of a chosen few
(Losses are taken, mind states are shaken)
They stay dumb deaf and blind
(Til our forces awaken)
