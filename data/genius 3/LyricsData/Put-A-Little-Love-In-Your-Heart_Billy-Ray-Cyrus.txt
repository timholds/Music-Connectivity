[Verse 1]
Think of your fellow man
Lend him a helping hand
Put a little love in your heart

[Verse 2]
You see it's getting late
Oh, please don't hesitate
Put a little love in your heart

[Chorus]
And the world will be a better place
And the world will be a better place
For you and me
You just wait and you'll see

[Verse 3]
Another day goes by
Still the children cry
Put a little love in your heart

[Verse 4]
If you want the world to know
We won't let hatred grow
Put a little love in your heart

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Take a good look around
And if you're looking down
Put a little love in your heart

[Verse 6]
I hope when you decide
Kindness will be your guide
Put a little love in your heart

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well, put a little love in your heart
You got to
Put a little love in your heart
Put a little love in your heart
There's no other way
Put a little love in your heart
It's up to you, babe
Put a little love in your heart
