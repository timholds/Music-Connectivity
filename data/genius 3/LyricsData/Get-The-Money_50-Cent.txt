[Intro: 50 Cent]
Yeah, 50
I make it feel brand new
Guess what they tell me?
You make me feel brand new
Fuck with me, yeah

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
It go one for the money, two for the dough
Three for the pimping now early with the hoes
Four for my niggas running around with .44's
Repping that five all the way live
I got a style that reign supreme, Bentley made to lean
Pull up say ''what up?'', make a major scene
Stunt, flash the cream, nine laser beam
It's hard to miss your team, just follow that dot then pop

[Hook: Horace Brown]
One for the money, two for the show
Three to get the honey's, here we go

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
I'm a South Side nigga, you can come through and ask for me
Systems thumping, pumping, 2Pac blast for me
Cali show me love, but me I'm from the East
I'm guessing I'm bi-costal when I'm on Dre beats
I get paper, stack paper, blow paper
Make paper, take paper, I'm major
I cake up, new Jacob, nigga, wake up
You're old straight up, pay up or get sprayed up

[Verse 3: Horace Brown]
M-O-N-E-Y, it's all good with me
Cause finally I can afford the life of luxury
And I remember in the day mamma had to work so hard
Just to pay the rent, all the money spent, had to get another job
And now we're living in an eight room mansion on the hill
And we sipping on, sipping on champagne when we chill
And we riding the Lex, Coupe, Beamers and the Benz
All over the world from the East to the West coast making ends
See, we do it

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Horace Brown]
The show is what we live for cause we love to sing
We gonna freak you up and down, it's how we do our thing
And to the ladies in the house tonight
Looking fly, you got it right
It's gonna be an afterparty
And I've got to have somebody
And take 'em to my eight room mansion on the hill
We'll be sipping on Champagne when we chill
And we're riding in the Lex, Coupe, Beamer and the Benz
All the players from the East to the West Coast, we're making ends
This is why we do it

[Hook]

[Bridge: Horace Brown]
Why we sing? Why we sing?
It's the joy it brings, joy it brings
You know that you like our style, the reason why, yeah
The reason why we do what we do
See we got a love for the music
Simple as one two, three, sing it

[Hook]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Man, you gonna be able to play this tape
Until I hear this shit coming outta every car, ma
