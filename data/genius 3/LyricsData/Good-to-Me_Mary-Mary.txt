No, no it ain't the way it used to be and
Yeah, yes, it may be hard to believe
When, when, I think all my blessings
I, oh I, tellin you God's been good to me

Growing up in a real big family
I had to take what I could get
There was always a sister or brother
I had to share everything with
I had to share my room, wear
Hand-me-downs
'Cause we didn't have much money
But now there's not much I long for
Tellin you God's been good to me

No, no it ain't the way it used to be and
Yeah, yes, it may be hard to believe
When, when, I think all my blessings
I, oh I, tellin you God's been good to me

You may think I've got it easy
And that's the way it's always been
But that's not the story
I'll tell you how it all happened
I had to work real hard to get here
But I didn't do it all alone
Someone was watching over me
And that is why i sing this song

No, no it ain't the way it used to be and
Yeah, yes, it may be hard to believe
When, when, I think all my blessings
I, oh I, tellin you God's been good to me

If I began to count my blessings
I wouldn't know where to begin
God has done so muchfor me
He's been much more than a friend
He's been protector and provider
Though I didn't always know
Always been right there beside me
And without him where would I be

(Chorus)
