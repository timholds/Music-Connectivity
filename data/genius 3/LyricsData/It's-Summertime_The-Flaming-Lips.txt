It's summertime and I can understand if you still feel sad
It's summertime and though it's hard to see its true possibilities
When you look inside, all you'll see
When you look inside, all you'll see is a self-reflected inner sadness
Look outside, I know that you'll recognize it's summertime
Look outside, I know that you'll recognize it's summertime
