[Intro]
This asylum in my mind
It isn't real
I became lost in this false reality
And I lost everything, everyone I ever cared about
It's done

[Verse 1]
I feel like it was yesterday I lived in an apartment
Lost my grandmother in August '09 slowly then I parted
From myself then dropped an EP cold, confused, and empty hearted
Now I'm back I put my headphones on and yell let's get it started
I'm a beast on the mic, want to see someone fight
For their dreams and their rights to be what they like
I'm mean when I write and seem out of sight
Don't clean out the bite, just bleed out the fright
Now sing loud and bright and let them know
That Kas is back again don't let that go
It means too much, now grip that shit
And hold on tight and set that goal
Now step back, woah, he's killing this shit
This right here is as real as it gets
He tries so hard, but it still isn't meant
To be because nobody can feel his intent
Yet they hear what he says and see what he does
Don't go home better plea for the buzz
Show them what you got then see what a fuss
Is made 'til everybody wants to be one of us
Now see what it does? Break that flow
Haters get jealous and I hate that no
Body ever wants to see others make that dough
I can keep pushing forward but I stay back though
I ain't in it for the money cause I been broke man
Trying to get a nine to five ever since '08
Said fuck it in '11 I'll just tie my shoes and
Take this ball and run it to the end zone, game

[Hook]
You'll be here soon so prepare yourselves
Be here soon so prepare yourselves
Be here soon so prepare yourselves
Cause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells

[Verse 2]
Started off slow now I'm racing to win
Didn't mean to go crazy, but face it I did
I lost my mind, if I say this again
I'm afraid of what I'll do man I pray it's the end
I'm chasing the wind in a dark night storm
And I'm coming to see how far I've torn
Away from myself and I'm blaming my health
But I'm the only one who killed the star I mourn
Now I'm talking to myself and it kind of makes me
Seem all insane, but it irritates me
That people have been judging me so much lately
I feel like I'm alone and everybody hates me
But then there are those times
That I feel God shows me signs
That everything will be ok
But then I feel like those are lies
And I feel like I'm despised
No one wants me in their lives
So I look into the mirror
And see the hatred in my eyes
And that is how I look at the devil inside
People want to know his name, it's irrelevant I
Never know what night I'll slip back in
To the wait a minute Kas if you tell of it, die
But I'm selling it, right? And half y'all don't even
Know what the fuck I'm talking about
Buy a flashy car start walking it out
Then we'll see how much I'll be rocking a crowd
Put some diamonds on my wrist start rhyming all like this
Imma get my money while I'm wilding on a bitch
It seems that it works if you're looking to be heard
But I'm looking to eat not looking to be served

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ziggy
Face me you coward, I'm not afraid of you
"Oh..."
You took everything from me, you did this to me
"Oh no, you did this to yourself"
Bullshit
"I was more important to you than anyone you loved"
I know what I have to do now
"What, kill me?"
No...
"No!"

[Hook]

[Outro]
You'll be here soon so prepare yourselves
Cause sooner or later we'll be sharing cells
Got your mind spinning like some carousels
This is how it all starts when a parent fails
