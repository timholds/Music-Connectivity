[Intro]
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Good hit
I got that good hit
Can I please have your attention?

[Verse 1]
I'm so dope, from head to toe
Armed and big, drop it low
On the ground, I put it down
Round and round, yeah, here we go
Push up on me, I'm on the floor
Talk up on it, make me yours
Give you my love, give me love back
Baby, I'm here, where you at?

[Chorus]
Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah I'm Midwest pimp tight, Texas fire
Don't you want me to have your baby?
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?

[Verse 2]
Bottoms up, yup, call them up, yup
Tell them that I got that gold
Buy me some Louis stuff
Buy me Gucci stuff, yup, that I Love Lucy stuff
Yup, baby, I'm a classic, don't you wanna bag me?
Don't you like my outfit, looking all flashy?
Don't you want to love me up right in traffic?
All up in my bum, bum trying to back, back
I'm standing here, where you are?

[Chorus]
Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah I'm Midwest pimp tight, Texas fire
Don't you want me to have your baby?
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?

[Bridge]
Baby, don't you wanna put your hands on me?
On me, on me, on me, oh
Baby, I can rock it like you can't believe?
Believe, believe, believe, yo
I know you love you my swagger
I know you like my style
I know you like my, mmmhmmm
I make the boys go wild
I got you boo, relax
Baby, I am here, where you at?

[Chorus]
Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah I'm Midwest pimp tight, Texas fire
Don't you want me to have your baby?
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo?
