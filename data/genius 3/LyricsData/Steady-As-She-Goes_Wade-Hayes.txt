[Verse 1]
Tonight I came home late again
She didn't ask me where I've been
Her bags were packed and sitting by the door
She looked at me and said goodbye
I did my best to change her mind
But she don't want to hear it anymore

[Chorus]
She's steady as she goes
Now she's not crying
If I said it didn't hurt
I'd be lying
Where she got the strength to leave
Heaven only knows
But she's a rock, steady as she goes

[Verse 2]
It tears me up to watch her go
But deep inside my heart I know
Leaving is the only choice she has
I guess she finally got the nerve
To give me just what I deserve
She's had enough and she ain't looking back

[Chorus]
She's steady as she goes
Now she's not crying
If I said it didn't hurt
I'd be lying
Where she got the strength to leave
Heaven only knows
But she's a rock, steady as she goes

[Tag]
She's a rock
Steady as she goes
