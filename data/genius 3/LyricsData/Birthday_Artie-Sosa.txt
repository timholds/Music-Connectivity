(Verse: 1)
Remember when life was simple
Everyday sitting poolside with my people
Never focused on the negaitves and fake bitches
Only focus was the weed that I be hitting
Everyday seems perfect and that's over priced
Chillin while my mind runs with you by my side
Man I wish that life was a still pic
Lettin time run by as I take a hit
I used to think things would never ever be the same
I see you found love and I hope you changed
Me I just enjoy the simple things till I die
With the people with me till the day I die
When I die man I hope to say i got to live
Life is just a game and I never win
Will I die or go to jail is the only end
Living life with the devil on the rear view

(Verse:2)
I see life in one way this one way is taking me far away
Dreamin big because we live once maybe you'll look back and say I was the one
True love is truly heartwarming callin
Someone your own and their all for it
Be the change you want to see I changed my life for the good and gained enemies
