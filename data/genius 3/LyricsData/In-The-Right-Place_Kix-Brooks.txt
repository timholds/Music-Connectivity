[Verse 1]
Hey pretty girl just look at you tonight
A team a horses couldn't drag me away
You ain't got no business being lonely baby
Yeah, let me put a smile on your face
I hope you don't mind if I put a little Otis Redding on
And pour us a glass of wine
We'll dance like drunken fools across my living room baby
Yeah pull your body close to mine

[Chorus]
If you're needing a friend to talk to, baby
Lay it on me, I've got all night
If you are wanting a man who's wanting to hold ya
Come on give these arms of mine a try
And if you are looking for something a little stronger
Oh baby, you ain't got to look no longer
You're in the right place
Yeah, you're in the right place

[Verse 2]
Oh look at me, I went and kissed you
Too late to turn back now
You've got that certain something and I just can't resist you
Let me show you what I'm all about

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, if you're needing a friend to talk to, baby
Lay it on me, I've got all night
If you're wanting a man who's wanting to hold ya
Come on give these arms of mine a try
