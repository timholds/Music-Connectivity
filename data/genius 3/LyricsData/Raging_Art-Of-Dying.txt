I try to play along
This is my life
Make like there's nothing wrong
Living a lie

I think it every day
Lost in the crowd
Slowly, this sanctuary...
Is coming unwound

Here I go again...

Raging!
I'm suffocating!
My heart is racing!
It's like I'm dying inside!
Raging!
Hell is raising!
My hands are shaking!
I'm going out of my mind!

Raging...
Raging...

I hide, I medicate
I fall in line
Maintain my masquerade
Biting my time

Learning that all to soon
The anger will win
Walls in this tiny room, will come crashing in...

Here I go again...

Raging!
I'm suffocating!
My heart is racing!
It's like I'm dying inside!
Raging!
Hell is raising!
My hands are shaking!
I'm going out of my mind!

I keep burying my skeletons!
Here I go again!

Raging!
I'm suffocating!
My heart is racing!
It's like I'm dying inside!
Raging!
Hell is raising!
My hands are shaking!
I'm going out of my mind!

Here I go again...
Here I go again

Raging
