(Scorcher)
Intro:
Yeah! It's All Love

Verse 1:
Look, I'm going in harder than ever
Stars on the sweater
Flows on steroids, the bars like a feather
Punchlines heavy so im boxing
Brudda tried to F-k with the circle ima box him (Box him)
Real brudda, I ain't gotta pretend
I'll be in the top 4 till the scene ends
Lyrically the flows in the deep end
What you know about 6 shows in the weekend?
Fans all over the globe, thats what the tour does
Bee hive, all you other brudda's got a small buzz
So if a Nigga hates anything Scorch does
Tell him im getting paid, so its all love
(Talay Riley)

Chorus:
Never gonna quit it
Better than you done it
Ima get it
Ready to brawl, Its All Love
Im a wizard
On this flying S--t
Call me quidditch
Im on the ball
