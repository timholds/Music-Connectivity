[Chorus: 2x]
Game still recognize game
Caught up for a minute
But I still in it for the change
And it's a shame
And everybody thought of slack
I let em know, fo sho
Coo Coo Cal still got much game

[Verse 1]
Still got that drive in my eyes for this rap
And let the city know
Better disappear (?) fear that I weren't comin back
Packed up my pen and paper
Set asside the gin and capers
Called up Big Hank and then he drop a bomb for a big old playa
Competition scared cuz done wrote a rap
All up in the clubs
Illegally makin love tried a (?) mack
We see dem letters from the record shops
Screamin they love the album
And then get near ten thousand when the next one drop
Haters try to deny the funk, but affected by the bong
They gettin caught up (?) wit my tape on bum
Ya'll shoulda known that I weren't gone
Needa sit back and watch a bunch of squares take a big fat playa throne
I come two quarters slip 'n fall
Besides I gotta gang a trunks
Backin me up with pumps, and they all ball
I kinda wanna mention names
Just to let em know, fo sho, Coo Coo Cal still got much game

[Chorus: 2x]
Game still recognize game
Caught up for a minute
But I still in it for the change
And it's a shame
And everybody thought of slack
I let em know, fo sho
Coo Coo Cal still got much game

[Verse 2]
Still count the cheese with all dem G's from off the set
And let the city know that I'm out the game
But I still count change on a regular, cashin checks
Ain't nothin change except my dizzalls
And the fact that I don't bizzalls
But I still take shoppin sprees up at the mizzalls, shzzalls
Should've known that I was comin back
Ridin 'Lac on hundred spokes
Runnin with folks that (?) get fools to talk that smack'
I'm in this game until I die
Even the (?) when I'm high
But physically fit
To drop these hits until you hear my cries
Coo Coo Cal now
Coo Coo Cal later
Coo Coo Cal a make a promise
I'ma sell a mil and make em feel the playa
They got me strugglin on my own
Tall and skinny, but in me I got the muscle
Out here hustlin for a microphone
Ain't no stoppin this bum rush
Cuz I'm plush
Haters pretend but end up gettin crushed
Try'n ta fuck wit us
I kinda wanna mention names
Just to let em know, fo sho, Coo Coo Cal still got much game

[Chorus: 2x]

[Verse 3]
Game still recognize game
Caught up for a minute
But I still in it for the change
And it's a shame
And everybody thought of slack
I let em know, fo sho
Coo Coo Cal still got much game

[Coo Coo Cal talking]
Ha ha ha, ya'll thought I was gone, didn't you?
Fool
It's Coo Coo Cal now
It's Coo Coo Cal tomorrow
It's Coo Coo Cal to the year two-thou
Now, I dunno what made ya'll think, ya understand, I was up out this game
I'm in this game for life, and that's fo real
You'll see me now
Ha ha you gone see me later, fo sho

[Verse 3]
Still kick it with G's who imbreeded by some flo's
Had to let the city know '86 assassin
Still blastin smashin off on Vo's
With Smith 'n pros and cars to roll
With G's load up, get drunk and kick it like two playas when the (?)
Ain't nothin change except the season
And do no dirt until you fools give us a reason
Tryin to count miss (?)
My clique is thicker than a brick buildin
You even think about runnin up on my clan you'll get a sick feelin
Ain't nothin poppin but that (?)
All up in the movies
Gettin freaky with your braud cuz she's sweatin partna
I kinda wanna mention names
Just to let em know, fo sho, Coo Coo Cal still got much game

[Chorus: 4x]
Game still recognize game
Caught up for a minute
But I still in it for the change
And it's a shame
And everybody thought of slack
I let em know, fo sho
Coo Coo Cal still got much game
