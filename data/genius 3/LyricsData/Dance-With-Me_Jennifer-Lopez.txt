[Verse 1]
Too much is on your mind
Got to let it go
Can't worry all the time
Just let it flow
You say you need a break
There's nothing I can do
Sitting here listening to you
Baby, what's this you tell me
Things isn't been going your way
Just take it from me
It's going to be alright
So let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

[Chorus]
Dance the night away
Party until the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance
Dance
Dance with me
DJ if you please

[Verse 2]
Nobody's on the wall
That's what I like
Come closer to me now and hold me tight
Tell me just how you're feeling right now
Are you really having a good time
Baby, what's this you tell me
Thing's isn't been going your way
Just take it from me
It's going to be alright
So let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Up in the club
Out on the floor
Move to the beat
Dancing with me
DJ, DJ, play my music
Dance the night away

[Chorus]
