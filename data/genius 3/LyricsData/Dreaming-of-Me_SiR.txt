[Verse 1]
You ain't gotta tell me I been on your mind
You fell asleep in my t-shirt
Gripping my pillow tight
You didn't think I would be here tonight
Went to bed listenin' to what we like
Made the perfect little playlist
Looks like somebody was makin' plans to welcome me home again

[Bridge]
But I landed early and I couldn't wait up
I been missin' you lately, I made my escape
But it seems like I'm already here in your dreams
And I couldn't stand to mess up a good thing

[Chorus]
(It's been a mighty long time since I held you tight)
But I can't wake you when you're dreaming of me
(Get ready for the sunrise, I'ma make it right)
But I can't wake you when you're dreaming of me

[Verse 2]
Lately I've been puttin' in overtime, life on the road can get lonely
I was never good with time away and it gets a little harder everyday
Everything is better when I'm by your side, I mean the world is amazin'
All I ever really want to do is make my way back to you

[Bridge]
But I landed early and I couldn't wait up
I been missin' you lately, I made my escape
But it seems like I'm already here in your dreams
And I couldn't stand to mess up a good thing

[Chorus]
(It's been a mighty long time since I held you tight)
But I can't wake you when you're dreaming of me
(Get ready for the sunrise, I'ma make it right)
But I can't wake you when you're dreaming of me

[Verse 3]
You've been calling my phone all day
I'm sorry if I made you worry
But now that I'm standin' in your grace
I'm reminded why I have to earn it

[Hook]
(It's been a mighty long time since I held you tight)
But I can't wake you when your dreaming of me
(Get ready for the sunrise, I'ma make it right)
But I can't wake you when you're dreaming of me
