Breathe,it's time for the show now
Please,you're never gonna know how
What you've got that's better for the taking
All this trouble with the folks in the making
I've been accused of plagiarism
Who's the one with the f*cked up vision?
Anti-peace,dyslexic people,boms,and epileptic evil
I think we should have a say but what's the point?
And by the way...

I'm a stranger, walking in this land
I'm a stranger, so try to understand
We're not all the same

Hey!Did you think I was single?
Oh?!You asked me out to the bingo
I don't do your numbers and granny dates
All I wanna do is be a pirate
Why,should I compromise it?
I can't pucker up for your sh*t
As I said I'm a lonesome ranger
In your head I'm always a stranger
I think we should have a say but what's the point?
And by the way...

I'm a stranger, walking in this land
I'm a stranger, so try to understand
We're not all the same

Who runs the show round here? Yeah
I said Who runs the show round here?

I'm a stranger, walking in this land
I'm a stranger, so try to understand
We're not all....
I'm a stranger, walking in th√Øs land
I'm a stranger, so try to understand
We're not all the same
