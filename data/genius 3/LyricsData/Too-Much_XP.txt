Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you

[Verse: XP]
I'm done playing inside but I'm outstanding
Lifes getting hard can my heart bare it
Always keep her with me like a horse and carriage
Always keep it right like I'm Jason Terry
That's unfair why I always gotta take it there
Drake dance in that spotlight
Don't hit me up like you really care
Late nights on that L train I still take that shit to this very day
All my from a scary place
Where they'll take shots like a gun range, power moves nowadays man these girls all come it twos
And they ain't even really here for me
And they really ain't here for you
Use to make girls uncomfortable and tbh man I still kinda do
Cause these girls don't like rap niggas
And these girls don't like fat niggas
And these girls don't  like black niggas
Every song I makes a hit single
Far from another sex symbol but I'm just beginning like
A double dribble
I use to wanna be travis now I wanna be timmy more
Leaving wack niggas feeling sore while
Cause they old shit like a CD store
Dede said I said I deserve I wonder if its all worth it
A new york nigga that'll blow up thats unheard of
And I birthed em I'm unworthy

Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
