I can't believe we have to deal with so much misery
We tear each other down, it's such a shame to see
All the love we could share, we take for granted
You never miss what you had until its gone

(chorus)
Life is unpredictable
You could be here today, and gone tomorrow
Why waste precious time
When all we need to find is the love inside

It's up to us to make a better way
We have to change our hearts to heal the world today
Don't cost you nothing but a smile
To make somebody's life feel worthwhile

(Chorus)
Life is unpredictable
You could be here today, and gone tomorrow
Why waste precious time
When all we need to find is the love inside

(bridge)
You can take it to a place
Beautiful, wonderful, unpredictable

(chorus)
Life is unpredictable
You could be here today, and gone tomorrow
Why waste precious time
