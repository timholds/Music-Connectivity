[Intro: Da Brat]
Welcome to the wonderful world of Destiny's Child
I'm the Brat-tat-tat
My homeboy Den on the track
And we gonna lay you flat on your back
With the beat-boom-boom-pat-pat like that, y'heard me? Now we comin' into this game like some survivors and we leavin' this game like some survivors
So from now until we dead and gone we gonna be some survivors, y'heard me?
Beyonce where you at?
Uh!

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Now that you're out of my life, I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you, but I'm stronger
You thought that I'd be broke without you, but I'm richer
You thought that I'd be sad without you, I laugh harder
You thought I wouldn't grow without you, now I'm wiser
Though that I'd be helpless without you, but I'm smarter
You thought that I'd be stressed without you, but I'm chillin'
You thought I wouldn't sell without you, sold nine million

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin' (2x)

[Verse 2: Kelly]
I'm wishin' you the best
(The best)
Pray that you are blessed
(Whoo whoo)
Bring much success, no stress, and lots of happiness
(I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' blast you on the radio
(I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' lie on you and your family
(I'm better than that)
I'm not gon' hate on you in the magazines
('m better than that)
I'm not gon' compromise my Christianity
(I'm better than that)
You know I'm not gon' diss you on the Internet
'Cause my Mama taught me better than that

[Chorus]
I'm a survivor
I'm not gon' give up
I'm not gon' stop
(Yea)
I'm gon' work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive

[Verse 3: Da Brat]
Uhh, c'mon,uhh
Now that I been through the storm and the rain
Climbed up the rough side but at times,but I remain
If I got the stuff to shine
And without the pump, protect mine
Survive in the game
Hate on me cuz you lame
They'll never see your face
Or say your name
No more pain for me
No more misery, cuz you history
Imma hold on to what I got
Strap on to my perfection, strap on protection
My own direction, born to be the best at what I do
I'ma make it through, stompin like a soldier in my big black boots
I keep 'em "Jumpin, Jumpin," stayin funky, funky for you
No matter who's that man who walk out of your life you don't need him for no reason
You don't need him, don't be heater
See 'em come and go
One switch, they not gold
No house, no mo, not even a condo
As long as I know how to love Imma stay alive
No need your game or style
They can't tame me cause I'm wild, not ashamed of stayin down
Can the rain sit, and 'em things chromed out, spit
And in my game, no doubt, I'ma get paid in a big way, survivor!

[Chorus til Fade]
