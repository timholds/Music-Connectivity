My mind is broken by the sound but it gets me around
My mind is broken by the sound but it gets me around

Bouncing off the higher winds in little basements
Jamming in the bush for ten odd years

I'm rarely in the right
I'm rarely in the right
I'm rarely in the right
I'm rarely in the right

My mind is broken by the sound but it gets me around
My mind is broken by the sound but it gets me around
My mind is broken by the sound but it gets me around
My mind is broken by the sound but it gets me around

Riding deadly nightshade in the sleeptime bottle
Sleepytime is violently from sugar water

I'm rarely in the right
I'm rarely in the right
I'm rarely in the right
I'm rarely in the right

My mind is broken by the sound but it gets me around
My mind is broken by the sound but it gets me around
My mind is broken by the sound but it gets me around
My mind is broken by the sound but it gets me around

I'm rarely in the right
I'm rarely in the right
I'm rarely in the right
I'm rarely in the right
