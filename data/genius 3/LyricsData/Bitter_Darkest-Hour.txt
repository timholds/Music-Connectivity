Shame is such a plain way to describe this state
And every forked tongue displays your intentions
With every forked tongue a way to ascension but
All is not well in this world we've created so bitter and jaded
Again with the same rusted routines we make
Does every forked tongue seem as unrelenting
As power as pressure every gluttonous pleasure you seek
All is not well in this world we've created
It's over you've fucking wasted it
