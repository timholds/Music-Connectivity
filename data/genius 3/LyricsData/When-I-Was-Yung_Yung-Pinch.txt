[INTRO]
That's right
Aye
Yung pinch you with the shits?
Yea yea
You getting lit?
Hell yea
Sipping on that Hennessy like oo yea
Seen you with that Hennessy like oo yea

Aye

[Chorus]
Come pour some liquor in my Cup
Hope you got that Hennessy, damn girls that's wassup
Might just let you hit the blunt
Only gotta hit it once
Shawty smoking on this OG now she can't get enough
(Ya she can't get enough)
Tryna live a life like she  never lived before
Told lil mama live it up
Bet she can't get enough
Ya bet she can't get enough
Yea yea

[VERSE - 1]

I met this chick when I was Yung
She let me kiss her with my tongue
Back then I thought that shit was cool (ya ya)
All my homies did too (Ya ya)
But That was back when I was Yung
Sneaking girls in my house
Shawty thought I was the one
Too bad it never worked out
Lemme tell ya right now
Girls jus wanna have fun
Dress up nice and get  drunk

[Chorus]
Come pour some liquor in my Cup
Hope you got that Hennessy, damn girls that's wassup
Might just let you hit the blunt
Only gotta hit it once
Shawty smokin on this OG now she can't get enough
(Ya she can't get enough)
Tryna live a life like she  never lived before
Told lil mama live it up
Bet she can't get enough
Ya bet she can't get enough
Yea yea

[Verse - 2]
I met this chick when I was Yung
Hit it once then she was sprung
We used to make out in her pool (ya ya)
Then She played me like a fool (ya ya)
But that back when I was Yung
Didn't care about shit
I was really just a kid, tryna get it in, man let me live
Life still goes on
Now she loves my songs
Say she miss my voice
Fell in love by choice
Different book same story
Good girl bad boy
Boy breaks girls heart then she fall apart tryna fill the void

[BRIDGE]
Now she's
Up all night and she can't stop drinking
No she can't stop drinking
No she can't stop now..

So

[Chorus]
Come pour some liquor in my Cup
Hope you got that Hennessy, damn girls that's wassup
Might just let you hit the blunt
Only gotta hit it once
Shawty smokin on this OG now she can't get enough
(Ya she can't get enough)
Tryna live a life like she  never lived before
Told lil mama live it up
Bet she can't get enough
Ya bet she can't get enough
Yea yea
