[Verse: Beyonce]
I like the way I feel
The way you keep it real
So many simple things
That you don't know the joy you bring
I like how you and me work
When we hang out we're so happy
I never want it to end
I know that we'll always be down and be together
Cause that's how I want to be

[Chorus:]
Any time you're feelin' down
I will always be around
Know that
(I'm always for you)
You know that
You don't have to go nowhere
I will always be right here
Know that
(I'm always for you)
You know that

[Verse: Beyonce]
I'm crazy 'bout the way
You let me do my thing
So many reasons why
I want you in my life
I like how you and me
No doubt about
We're were meant to be
I never want it to end
I know that we'll always be down and be together
That's how I want it to be
So

[Pre-Chorus:]
No doubt about
I got ya back
Can no one come between us
Together and forever, babe

[Chorus:]
Any time you're feelin down
I will always be around
Know that
(I'm always for you)
You know that
You don't have to go nowhere
I will always be right here
Know that
(I'm always for you)
You know that
