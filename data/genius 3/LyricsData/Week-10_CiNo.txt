Today I'll tell a story where I'm in a fedora
Shades on, sun behind, extraordinary contour
Eating some labia minora down in Bora Bora
You keep giving old testaments, you're a Torah
I'm more of a coroner going through corridors
If you don't see me, that's so poor of ya, sorry bruh
Call it a win on my side, high rise
I fly through that night sky like Sci-Fi
You getting the connection? No WiFi
I will rhyme fry till I die
My poison pen will turn boys to men
I spit pearls, you gotta bring oysters in
I'm back up in this bitch making noise again
I'ma keep going in till my voice give in
If you feeling it, then it is real
If you battle me, you'll take a big L
I jizzed on a bitch, say her name is Giselle
She wants me in her ass, but what does it entail?
Her skin's frail, but her friend's pretty cute too
Two beautiful chicks trying to seduce you
It's time to get in a loose mood like "Who's who?"
Pound the vagina down till I make it shoot juice
Then I feel a bit rude when I give her the boot
But fuck it, bitch move, got instrumentals to chew
I've fallen in love twice, but never with you
Both times I ain't know what I was getting into
There's levels to this, I'm high on that competitive list
Apex Predator, nobody ever better than this
I'm the Lyrical God, this is metaphysics
I can severe your wrists with delicateness
For no amount of money, I'll flow around a dummy
In that Orange County sunny, now it's sorta sounding funny
So I jump like Jordan to get to the recordin'
Booth, it's important, Mr. Norton
Can paint the bigger picture, I came to rip it with ya
If you take my riches, bitter, I'll aim to freakin' hit ya
Bang, the shit is "fin" bruh, dangerous like ninjas
The blade'll get you injured, I'll swing the shit against ya
I don't think you ready for that Super Saiyan trilogy
So I rhyme now on a smoother J. Dilla beat
Who do they think they be? I'm Buddha's base energy
You ain't evolved yet, I'm a newer age entity
Eventually I'll get in the game, there's an entry fee
Plenty look at me and feel rancor and jealousy
They envy cuz my skill made me MVP
You can get most my shit free on MP3
I'ma do it big, on or off MTV
Say "Fuck You" to all of the FCC
It's VZ!
