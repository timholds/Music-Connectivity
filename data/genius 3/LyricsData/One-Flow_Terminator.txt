[Verse 1: Terminator]
These man can't move to me
I'll move to man and sleep peacefully
When I first knifed man, it felt funny
The next day come, it became funny
I don't knife for fun, but I'll knife your mum
If she backs the wall, then I'll knife her lung
Feel bad after; get over it
She should have thought twice about backing her son
Don't chat a bag of lies; I'll react to guys
If man is hench, I'll knife man down to size
Look in man's eyes while he's clutching his neck
I think about his family ties
Who's next to knife? I'll knife man up
Like he's meant to die; like his family's meant to cry
I'm a normal geez', but I'm down to ride
I've got emotions, but I'll put them to the side

[Verse 2: Scorcher]
T's got one flow that I had to borrow
So I could explain if I clap the hollows
And it clips your neck, your head disconnects
And rolls on the floor like the ball at soccer
You can't war me; you need more Ps
Cause I'll buy guns and more T
I don't shout in public or cause scenes
Just send man slumping in his Ford Jeep
In his Ford Jeep, leave his head resting
As the horn beeps, next to a dead bredrin
Come out and rinse the clip off, and you rip the whip off
Yeah, after the four beat

[Hook: Terminator]
I'll just let man know
That I've got one flow
If I knife you up
You won't get sewn

[Verse 3: Terminator]
To guard yourself from me, you'll need a red dot
Red spot. The way I'll be moving
You'll need an ACOG plus specs infoc'
You'll also need an infra-red
Just in case I roll up in the dark
Light switched off, roll up in the car
Pull up outside your yard, complete the objective
T you up like Charizard; leave no mark
Pierce your skin, pierce your heart
You'll need a jump-start; hardly breathing
Heart not pumping blood; instant surgery
Will need to take part for you not to leave your ma

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Scorcher]
I've got a bag of flows: I could choose any
But if you test me, I hit Darkside mode
And wear Darkside clothes: the gloves and leather
Push man up in weather
Straight eight clapper, brain splatter
White shirt red and you ain't Santa
Or Man United. If your gang are hyping
Run into crowd, random knifing
I can't stand excitement, so calm down
Or there'll be loud sirens
Nosey neighbours. My Darks owe me favours
I'll just phone T and there'll be man dying

[Hook]
