While she lay sleeping
I stay out late at night
And sing my songs

And sometimes oh the nights they seem so long
And it's good when I finally make it home
All alone

While she lays dreaming
I try to get undressed without the light
Then quietly she says, how was your night
And I go to her and say, it was alright
And I hold her tight

And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her someday if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs
But I was wrong

And she has faith in me
And so I go on trying, faithfully
And who knows on some special night
If my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

While she lays waiting
I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
Then I see my old guitar in the night
Waiting for me like some secret friend
And ask away

And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she sees in me
I told her one day if she was my girl
I could change the world
With my little songs
But I was wrong

And she has faith in me
And so I go on trying, faithfully
And who knows maybe on some special night
If my song is right
I will find a way, find a way

'Cause she believes in me
Believes, believes in me
