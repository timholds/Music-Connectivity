[Intro: Bronze Nazareth]
The Great Migration... grab on, it's free, nigga
Pick it up from your local street corner, nigga
By the fucking liquor store
Yeah... check me, yo.. check mate

[Bronze Nazareth]
In the jungles, streets hard, flee God, doubt God
Why God? Moms heard me scream, like I've been scorned
The beef so supreme, Lord, vatos got hoes
Playing for my house doughs, another dose of some vicadine
Slicing in, jutting in, like sudden cutting wind
And we got severe strokes, sword tip, pin popes, send folks
To hell, when the doors close, it's hard here, my dear
Kiss your chin, missed again, this is Michigan
AKA Babylon Ceasar Sin, it's me again
Grabbing at your back door like a raptor, you need me, you actors
Revelations, came in, deteurate men and women
MC's.... go home and smoke them leaves
Slice and dice, pure rate, my forte is swordplay
Chop-off-ya-limbs day, sway off strings of ligaments
This nigga bends, Kevlaar lives, and rock, black Timbs
Only wins, between punching, dungeon walls, and basements
Relentless, Killa Bee, sting like flying jellyfish
A king walks around, with a pen and a severed wrist

[Chorus: sample]
Oh... I want you to know
My life is yours to share
Just assured, as the skies are blue
I said..

[Bronze Nazareth]
Yo, in the streets, jungles deep, run from man, haunted lands
Skeletons, they haunting man, you argue fam, we flaunting hands
It might just, let the pipes bust, in a birth canal, I creep from wells
With secret spells, that teach and tell, my speech'll kill, as deep as hills
As deep as steel, we dwell on scarred blocks, where they scar cops
They don't even come, for evening suns, I'm grieving, and be needing guns
Cause stocks and bonds are far beyond, the poverty lines, we stand for years
Hooded life, crimson rain, singing in the veil of tears
Trail of beers and vodka, I'm on a, different planet
I crack skulls like granite, that was blast out of cannon
From standing on porches, to handing off roach clips
I'm so swift, I broke ribs, and came back like Joe Gibbs
Blow kids out boxes, box cutters and Glock clips
The loudest, obnoxious, shots, just woke me
From my worst, nightmare, we thirst for light years
Cause dark days and brain stays, over me, like no one seem
Can't control the scenes, I'm just an actor in the scripts of life
My pen poison is quick to strike, cause skin moistness, my kryptonite
I skipped a hype, and took the elevator, toward heaven's light

[Chorus]
