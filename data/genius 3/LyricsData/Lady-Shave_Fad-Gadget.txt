Worried girl
Shaves her legs
Creams her arms
And she creams her chest
Worried girl
Shave it, shave it, shave it, shave it

Pluck your brow
Pluck it now
Until it's sore
Then drip the blood on the floor
Oh worried girl
Shave it, shave it, shave it, shave it

Shower scenes, giggling teens
And stupid magazines spread a social disease
Oh worried girl
Aaaaahhhhhh

Lady shave
Don't misuse that blade
Lady shave
Don't slip that blade
Oh worried girl
You don't have to shave it
Shave it, shave it, shave it, shave it

Lady shave
Oh lady shave
