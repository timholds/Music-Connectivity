[Hook: J.Paul]
I just wanna be like you
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to
You’re teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like, like
I just gotta be like you

[Verse 1: Lecrae]
Dear, Uncle Chris, Uncle Keith, Uncle Ricky
Before the Lord get me I gotta say something quickly
I grew up empty since my daddy wasn’t with me shoot
I wasn’t picky I’d take any male figure
You
Stepped in at the right time
It’s ‘cuz of you that I write rhymes
You probably never knew that
I loved the way you used to come through
Teach me to do the things that men do
True
You showed me stuff I probably shouldn’t have seen
But you had barely made it out your teens
And took me under your wings
I wanted hats, I wanted clothes just like you
Lean to the side when I rolled just like you
Didn't care people didn’t like you
You wanna bang, I wanna bang too
Skyline, piru
You would’ve died, I would’ve died too
You went to prison, got sick, lost your pops
Yeah, I cried too
You never know who’s right behind you
Gotta a little son now and he do whatever I do
But it’s something deep inside you
That tell you what gotta be more than doing what other guys do
They had nobody there to guide you
But I followed your footsteps and this shouldn’t surprise you
You realize you
You realize you, you, you
Yeah

[Hook: J.Paul]
I just wanna be like you
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to
You’re teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like, like
I just gotta be like you

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Now all I see is money, cars, jewels, stars
Womanizers, tough guys, guns, knives, and scars
Drug pushers, thugs, strippers, fast girls, fast life
Everything I wanted and everything I could ask life
If this ain’t living and they lied well
Guess I married an old wives’ tale
Wow, fail
I don’t know another way to go
This is the only way they ever showed
I got this emptiness inside that got me fighting for approval because I missed out on my daddy saying, way to go
And get that verbal affirmation on know how to treat a woman
Know how to fix an engine
That keep the car running
So now I’m looking at the media and following what they feed me
Rap stars, trap stars
Whoever wants to lead me
Even though they lie they still tell me that they love me
They say I’m good at bad things at least they proud of me

[Hook: J.Paul]
I just wanna be like you
Walk like, talk like, even think like you
The only one I could look to
You’re teaching me to be just like you
Well I just gotta be like, like
I just gotta be like you


[Verse 3: Lecrae]
I was created by God but I ain’t wanna be like Him
I wanna be Him
The Jack Sparrow of my Caribbean
I remember the first created being
And how he shifted the blame on his dame
For fruit he should’t have eaten
And now look at us all out of Eden
Wearing designer fig leaves by Louis Vuitton
Make believing
But God sees through my foolish pride
And I’m weak life Adam another victim of Lucifer’s lies
But then in steps Jesus
All men were created to lead but we need somebody to lead us
More than a teacher
But somebody who buy us back from the darkness
Say He redeemed us
Taught us that real leaders follow God
Finish the work ‘cuz we on our job
Taught us not to rob
But give life love a wife like He loved the Church
Not seeing how many hearts we can break first
I wanna be like you in every way
So if I gotta die everyday
Unworthy sacrifice
But the least I can do is give the most to me
Because being just like you is what I’m ‘spose to be
You said you came for the lame
I’m the lamest
I made a mess but you say you’ll erase it
I’ll take it
You said you came for the lame
I’m the lamest
I broke my life, but you say you’ll replace it
I’ll take it

[Outro: J.Paul]
I just gotta be like..I just gotta be like.. I just gotta be like you
(like you like you like you)
