[9th Prince]
Eh-yo, eh-yo..
9th Prince, attack like Greg Valentine
With a sledgehammer, figure 4 bodyslammer
Decrease ya stamina, verbal heart damager
I'm half man, half monster like Bruce Banner
Camouflage Scorpio vendetta with a black Beretta, serial killer
Federal Expressman, FedEx, send deathbed letters to get cheddar
Verbal terrorist, I'm livin in a street life of rage
Machine gun sprayed and wet up the whole stage
Iron junk, metal razor blades I cough
Camouflaged Velour, I'm raw like the Eagle Claw
My tunes of glory, war stories took place inside a laboratory
Whispers in the dark, I think I hear fallen soldiers callin me
Rap battle cats trapped in combat
We hijackin planes, it's Islord, strap me with the gat to your back
Camouflage guerrillas performin drive-bys, like California gangstas
Strapped the Cadillacs, my lyrical assault murder weapon
'll blow ya rips out ya mid-secion
Chinese connection with the Wu-Tang perfection

[Beretta 9]
Chamber 9's perfection, constitute we movin in son
Shark style, peep the fin, pushin through like
Stiff arm Heisman, although we wise men
Don't make us act a fool, keep a calm, cool collective
A nice perspective, it only takes for one cat to disrespect his
Or ruin a show, oh what y'all ain't know
That everything's real like blue steel
Bein pulled out at a sold out concert?
The crowd went berzerk, here come the Jakes, red alert
They got trampled on, a cop lost one arm
Killarm' still live on stage don "Red Dawn"
Eh-yo, where "The Obsticle"? Anything's possible
"Allah Sees Everything", kid, check the obsticle
Beretta did his verse in the crowd, this kid's remarkable
9th punched a cat in the face, call the hospital
911 style, ShoGun cracked a smile
Or push this cat into Sin, through in the towel
It's like life's insane, Dom P pop champagne
And Is' came out of the crowd with 20 chains

[Islord]
Nonchalantly, I roll up on the rap scene bluntly
Still hittin fiends off monthly
Cuz this rap shit ain't feedin me
My physical is just lookin real good but my insides is cryin
Fiendin to catch like fifty analog niggas off point
And tear pockets, so stay still, tell ya crew
Don't even move, cuz I got like fifty-five keepin it live
Tight niggas trapped with rockets, pointed at ya eye sockets
Throwin ninety-nine joints at ya grill, you can't block it

[P.R. Terrorist]
Rebellious one, who never like to carry small guns
I like 'em big, bulky and shit, designed for ya wig
And any pig that try and confront me and my cig'
That bomb is rigged, ready to explode, get blown to Madrid
You and ya fam, you and ya mans and all of your kids
Because I'm nuts, spillin my guts like dry heavin
A fly even, cat that never split his pie even
Get caught in my life of fire and die weezin
And the man who seen it go down for no apparent reason
Just breathin and believin that it's pockets that I be greasin
He's deceived and relieved with dollar sign eyes gleamin
War ringin, diva bitch in my bed, she's soul singin
With my mic, suckin it right, my son's outside slingin
Beige snowballs, snot drip from his nose, eatin a Halls
I got a show, later tonight, I'm headed to the mall
I'll grab you somethin, if you see Fantasia tell her she frontin
Cuz I had her way in my lab and didn't fuck nothin
Life's somethin, somedays I be feelin like snipin somethin
Writin somethin that'll change the whole world, feel like I'm comin
With this black ink all over these white sheets
Run like a track meet with a fleet
Of killas and shit, don't even compete {*pause*}
Yo..
In a herd of white wool, label the black sheep
Tap dancin on fire, the kid with bronze feet
Terrorist snatchin the track, leavin the gold teeth
All you playas, killas, dogs, thugs - make it brief
{*echoes*}
