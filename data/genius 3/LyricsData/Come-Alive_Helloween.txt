It don't get better if you're locked behind your door
It don't get better if you're hiding more and more
It may get better if you fight
It may get better if you'd wear a mask and scream
On Halloween

Come alive – come alive
Rise and see – rise and be for me
Come alive – come alive
From the blue – make it true for you
Come alive

It don't get better if you're acting for a while
It don't get better if you drown in self denial
It don't get better if you turn around and flee to ecstasy

Come alive – come alive
Rise and see – rise and be for me
Come alive – come alive
From the blue – make it true for you
Come alive
