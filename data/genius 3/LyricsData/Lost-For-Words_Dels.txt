[Verse 1: Dels]
My love said I look blue, I look sick, I’m discoloured
We just lost Oscar to the sky, if I’m honest
Laying on my girl's bonnet, staring at the clouds
Trying not to break down and slide down the mound
I ask myself why is my soul in this flesh?
As my Mother cries acid, tears roll down her neck
And fall into the stream to connect with the sea
Escapism is the theme, living in a dream
Now tell me what you see?
Tell me can you feel her?
My heart ain’t bleeding, the winter’s the killer
My hair’s getting thinner, confronting the truth
My beard’s getting longer, I’m looking like you
Feel free to eat the fruit
But spit out the seeds
Perfection doesn’t exist practically
Unless we’re talking about Oscar...
The big man’s in a land right above us

[Hook]
Oh, I’m lost for words
Man I can’t believe I’m writing this verse, Talk to me now
It’s like I’m lost at sea
Melt away, seeing you in my dreams, walk with me now
Oh, I’m lost for words
Man I can’t believe I’m writing this verse, talk to me now
It’s like I’m lost at sea
Melt away, seeing you in my dreams...

[Verse 2: Dels]
Staring out the top window swear I saw you ride past
I’m talking about Leo who was taken too soon
I just want to say you’re not alone in the dark
And we all miss you I hope I see you real soon
For many moons, we all haven’t seen your face
I still hear your laughter as it echoes through my thoughts
Watch my life change course at a frantic pace
But I still feel your spirits lighting up the place
Holding onto memories, us gliding through the streets
Then the imagery depletes and fades into another...
Us ducking from Police
I still hear your tyres screaming
When I have a Son, you’ll never meet him
But I promise that he’ll know you
You’re in my heart, you’ll never leave it
All of us smiling under you

[Hook]
