When the moon is rising and looking on me
When the night comes knocking, knocking on me
I say, I ain't the one
I say, I ain't the one
I ain't the one that you looking for now

When the man comes asking and looking for me
When the law comes knocking, knocking on me
I ain't the one
(Ah, ah)
No, I ain't the one
I ain't the one that you're looking for now
Yeah, I ain't the one
I ain't the one
So now I'm leaving you all behind me

When the world comes crashing, crumbling on me
When the day comes knocking, knocking on me
I say, I ain't the one
I ain't the one
Hey, ha ha
Hey, ha ha
I ain't the one, I ain't the one
So now I'm leaving you all behind me
