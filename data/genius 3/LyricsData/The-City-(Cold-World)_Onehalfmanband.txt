[Intro]
Alright
This ones for the south
Lets go

[Hook (2x): Miguel and Mary J. Blige]
The city, the city, the city, the city, ohh
The city, the city, the city, the city, ohh
The city, the city, the city, the city, ohh
Lost in a cold world

[Verse 1: Onemanband]
In the city is where we grow up as young boys and girls
When we young we love our lives but grow older to hate the world
Husbands beat their wives and don't even think twice about the cure
Ain't no tellin how far the story goes
All we know is that we're unsure
Im like Lexis, except Im the pursuit of excellence
Cause perfectionist only look at life as a blur

[Hook (2x): Miguel and Mary J. Blige]
