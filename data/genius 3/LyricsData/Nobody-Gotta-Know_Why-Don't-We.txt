[Intro: Zach Herron]
Take the time with me tonight
You should come with me tonight
We can feel the free tonight
Nobody gotta know

[Verse: Jonah Marais & All]
I've been missin', I've been crushin' on ya all night
I should take you to the moon, that's a long flight
We should chill, me and you if it's alright
You should be my, you should be mine

[Pre-Chorus: Daniel Seavey]
See, I've been trying to find the right way to say to you
That I would walk a million miles to find my way to you
And there is no one else that ever could compare to you

[Chorus: Zach Herron & All]
Why don't you take the time with me tonight?
You should come with me tonight
And we can feel the free tonight
Nobody gotta know
And if they try to tell us wrong for right
We'll fix it in another life
Cause this is what we on tonight
Nobody gotta know
Nobody gotta know

[Post-Chorus: Zach Herron]
No, nobody gotta know
No, nobody gotta know
No, nobody gotta know

[Verse: Corbyn Besson & All]
I've been missin', I've been crushin' on ya all night
I should take you to the moon, that's a long flight
We should chill, me and you if it's alright
You should be my, you should be mine

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Avery]
See, I've been trying to find the right way to say to you
That I would walk a million miles to find my way to you
And there is no one else that ever could compare to you

[Chorus: Zach Herron & All]
Why don't you take the time with me tonight?
You should come with me tonight
And we can feel the free tonight
Nobody gotta know
And if they try to tell us wrong for right
We'll fix it in another life
Cause this is what we on tonight
Nobody gotta know
Nobody gotta know

[Post-Chorus: Zach Herron]
No, nobody gotta know
No, nobody gotta know
No, nobody gotta know, no
