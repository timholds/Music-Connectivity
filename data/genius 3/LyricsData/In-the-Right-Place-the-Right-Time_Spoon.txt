Everyone that's getting
Through is hit one time
In the right place
When it was just the right time
Won't you show me how
How to get to there right now?

If I need to buy a ticket
I'll put something down
Throw me in the thicket
I'll find my way out

Been so long down
It looks like up to me
I say it just a few more times
In the right place the right time
In the right place the right time
In the right place the right time
