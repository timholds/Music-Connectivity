[Hook]
Bad kids, all my friends are bad kids
Product of no dad kids
Kids like you and me
Bad kids ain't no college grad kids
Livin out on the skids
Kids like you and me

[Verse 1]
In Class
We are a minority
Got no
Respect for authority
And won't
Play well with others
And steal
From all your mothers
They'll try
To give us pills
Oh wait
Give us all the pills
Go cry
Mom I gotta go to court
Dad won't
Pay his child support

Well you got to understand
We only do these things because all we are is

Bad kids, all my friends are bad kids

Kids like you and me
Bad kids ain't no college grad kids
Livin out on the skids
Kids like you and me

[Verse 2]
At home
He throws a hissy fit
Time out
He doesn't give a shit
Got drunk
Off all of grandma's schnaps
Got caught
Runnin from the cops
Toilet
Paper in your yard
Six f's
On my report card
Smoke cigs
In the bathroom stall
Spray paint
A penis on the wall

Well you got to understand
We only do these things because all we are is
