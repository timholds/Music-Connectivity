[Verse 1]
Follow my heart, follow my feet
All the advice that I take
Fall into line, fall into place
All of these rules that you make

[Hook]
I know you want me to be something more but I know what I'm doing is right for me

[Chorus]
I don't need a silver lining
I don't need your hope
I can't seem to see you smiling
But it's okay, okay, I
I didn't need it anyway
I didn't need it anyway
I didn't need it anyway

[Verse 2]
All of my heart, all of my dreams
Give me a reason to chase them
Holding the past, split at the seams
I won't forget where I came from

[Hook]
Why won't you let me just be who I am  when I know what I'm doing is right for me?

[Chorus]
I don't need a silver lining
I don't need your hope
I can't seem to see you smiling
But it's okay, okay, I
I didn't need it anyway
I didn't need it anyway
I didn't need it anyway

[Bridge]
We can talk about the future
We can talk about it all
You could talk about my dreams, oh
Why are all the words you say so flawed?

[Chorus]
I don't need a silver lining
I don't need your hope
I can't seem to see you smiling
But it's okay, okay, I
I didn't need it anyway
I didn't need it anyway
I didn't need it anyway
I didn't need it anyway
I didn't need it anyway
