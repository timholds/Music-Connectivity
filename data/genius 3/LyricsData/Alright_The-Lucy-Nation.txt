I don't wanna be the one
The one who's always left behind
Will there ever come a day
When I can turn around and say

1 - It's all right now
It's all right now, yeah, yeah
It's all right now

I don't wanna be the one
The one who's always left undone
Losing more and more
I'm drained of everything
I'm falling down
I'll go see through in the sun saying

Repeat 1

Waiting, watching, restoration for those who stay
Waving to those that walk away

I don't wanna be the one, huh
If I could only see it
If I could only feel it
Will there ever come a day

Repeat 1 (3x)

Yeahâ€¦
