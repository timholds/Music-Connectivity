[Verse 1]
I put my money in the suitcase
And headed for the big race
I felt a chill on my backbone
As I hung up the telephone

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win pays double
And I got me a heavy bet

[Chorus]
Cold, cold sweat

[Verse 2]
They say chances on the outside
Are looking very slim
I've been so lucky on the inside
I feel I'm going to win

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
Take a little money, there's nothing left to lose
And I got me a heavy bet

[Chorus]
Cold, cold sweat

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
I've got me a whole month's wages
I haven't seen that much in ages
I might spend it in stages
And move out to Las Vegas

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Running down the back of my neck
To lose means trouble, to win pays double
And I got me a heavy bet

[Chorus]
Cold, cold sweat

[Outro]
I put my money in the suitcase
They say chances on the outside
I got a whole months wages
Stone cold sober and stone cold sweat
Stone cold crazy
Place another bet
