[Hook x3]
Yeah Shawty
You think you playin' on me?
Naw Shawty
I'm a P.I.M.P
Yea Shawty
This the K.R.I.T
Out of Mississippi
I'm from 30B

[Verse 1]
I met a fine yellow bone outside of this club
Hangin' with her friends, came up and showed love
I'm intrigued by the scene and the crowd seen you [?]
You got the rainbow louis with the belt and the hat
She seem independent to me, and that's cool
'Cause I ain't trickin' on no broad, and that's a rule
Look at every fine woman as possible clientele
A little conversation got digits to her cell'
I can tell she astounded by pimpin' that I spit
It only took a second, she starting to go deep
Asking me about my past and how I made cash
How much did it cost for grain on that dash
Straight to the sub, she tellin' me how she love it
Sayin' I'm her type, I'm nothing like all the others
I tell her "Broad, I ain't tryna' be a player
But I ain't captain cook on a hoe, I can't save her

[Verse 2]
I hit the [?] when she creepin to hoes with no shame
She talking much knowledge, I bet you she give brain
Do flicks to make change, however she make dough
You taking her out to eat, she sliding down stripper poles
The pro's they all know that your girl I spoke
And she fucking with other niggas but [?]
Pussy poppin', head bouncin' - bitch, break it to the floor
Said ok, tellin me "Don't let anybody know"
I got dough, I do tracks since she heard that I'm a star
Caught a [?] while I was getting out my car
[?], Everclear, probably sippin' on some Barre
Think I'm buying a drink, just because I'm living large
[?] is enough, I could never trust a broad
Buying shit for other niggas, maxing out my credit card
Never that, settle back, I'm a P.I.M.P
Who you think you fucking with? This the K.R.I.T
