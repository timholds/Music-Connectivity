Smile
It's not the end of the world
As far as I can tell
Everything is still the same

So why
Why are we stuck inside
It's such a glorious day
It's a shame to waste

When it rains it pours
And it's hard to believe
In a world so cold
It's sucking out the feeling

You will live
You will live through this
You will live
You will live through this

And I'm walking these crowded streets
I feel so alone
And it's hard to find some peace

And it feels like
An eternal dream
Down on bended knee
Still out of reach

When it rains it pours
And it's hard to believe
In a world so cold
It's sucking out the feeling

You will live
You will live through this
You will live
You will live through this
So hang on...
Hang on...
You gotta hang on...

As you feel it slip away
As they tear you down
Hang on...
Hang on...
Hang on...
Please

You're gunna live
You're gunna live through this
Hang on...
Hang on...
