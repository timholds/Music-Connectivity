[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
It had been many years since I'd been in love
With a real man, I had given up on love
I didn't think a good man existed in this world
I was tired of searching
Because relationships I dealt with in the past
Couldn't fathom being monogamous
And when I least expected it, I found you
And because of you I know how it feels to be

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Love, and when I look into your eyes I see
Love, pillow talk at night and I can hear your
Love, the next morning we make
Love, I'm so in love

[Chorus]
Through you I live and love again
Open the path to happiness
Through you I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you I live and love again
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand
Through you I learned to smile again
I love you, (i love you)I love you (i love you)

[Verse 2: Kelly]
Now it's been three years since we've been in love
And you keep doing things to show you're proud of
Thirty beauties in the room, only me you see
The confidence you give lives in me
I vow to never break your heart, I'll never let you down
For better or worse, I'll always be around
And with you here to share, my life's so complete
And because of you I know how it feels to be

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Love, and when I look into your eyes I see
Love, pillow talk at night and I can hear your
Love, the next morning we make
Love, I'm so in love

[Chorus]
Through you I live and love again
Open the path to happiness
Through you I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you I live and love again
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand
Through you I learned to smile again
I love you, (i love you)I love you (i love you)

[Bridge: Michelle]
I thank God for you
Your love's amazing
And like the rain it fell on me
Wanting it more and more
Cause your love's in the air I breathe
Lying beside me
You see into the soul of me (You see into the soul of me)
And your spirit sets me free

[Chorus x2]
Through you I live and love again
Open the path to happiness
Through you I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you I live and love again
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand
Through you I learned to smile again
I love you, (I love you) I love you (I love you)

Through you I live and love again
Open the path to happiness
Through you I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you I live and love again
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand
Through you I learned to smile again
I love you, (I love you) I love you (I love you)

[Verse 2: Beyoncé and Kelly]
Now it's been three years since we've been in love
And you keep doing things to show you're proud of
Thirty beauties in the room, only me you see
The confidence you give lives in me
I vow to never break your heart, I'll never let you down
For better or worse, I'll always be around
And with you here to share, my life's so complete
And because of you I know how it feels to be

[Chorus x2]
Through you I live and love again
Open the path to happiness
Through you I learned to smile again
I thank God for you
Through you I live and love again
I trust you, just guide me, take my hand
Through you I learned to smile again
I love you, (I love you) I love you (I love you)
