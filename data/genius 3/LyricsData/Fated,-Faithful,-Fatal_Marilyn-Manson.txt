[Verse 1]
I don't know if I can open up
I've been opened enough
I don't know if I can open up
I'm not a birthday present

I'm aggressive aggressive
The past is over
Now passive seems so pathetic

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?

[Chorus]
I'm feeling stoned and alone like a heretic
And I'm ready to meet my maker
I'm feeling stoned and alone like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker

Lazarus got no dirt on me
Lazarus got no dirt on me
And I'll rise to every occasion
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles
Of Los Angeles

[Verse 2]
Don't know if I cannot open up
I've been opened too much
Double-crossed and glossed over in my Pathos

[Pre-Chorus]
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?

[Chorus]
I'm feeling stoned and alone like a heretic
And I'm ready to meet my maker
I'm feeling stoned and alone like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker

Lazarus got no dirt on me
Lazarus got no dirt on me
And I'll rise to every occasion
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles
Of Los Angeles

[Bridge]
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?
Are we fated, faithful, or fatal?
Yeah

'Cause I'm feeling stoned and alone, like a heretic
And I'm ready to meet my maker
I'm feeling stoned and alone, like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker

[Chorus]
I'm feeling stoned and alone, like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker
'Cause I'm feeling stoned and alone, like a heretic
I'm ready to meet my maker

Lazarus got no dirt on me
Lazarus got no dirt on me
'Cause I'll rise to every occasion
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles
Of Los Angeles
I'm the Mephistopheles of Los Angeles
