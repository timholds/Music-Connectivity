[Verse 1]
I know that look in your eyes
And I know now what's behind that smile
You can't fool me too long
You can't fool me too long

[Verse 2]
Wanted so bad to be the only one
I couldn't see it for what it was
I fooled myself for too long
I fooled myself for too long

[Verse 3]
You fled the scene to go be free
You overdosed on your fantasies
You fooled yourself for too long
You fooled yourself too long

[Chorus 1]
Can't fool me now, can't fool me now
Can't fool me now, can't fool me now
'Cause I cannot remain
And I will not remain here anymore

[Verse 4]
The true nature of our love
Split the seems and spilled out of us
We fooled ourselves for too long
We fooled ourselves for too long

[Chorus 2]
Get out my way, get out my way
Get out my way, get out my way
'Cause I cannot remain
And I will not remain here anymore

[Verse 5]
I look but I can't see
What the hell this has done to me
I fooled myself for too long
I fooled myself for too long
