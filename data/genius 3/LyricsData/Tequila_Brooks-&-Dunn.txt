[Verse 1]
One shot, two shot, three, Tequila floor
Cowboy bouncers about to bowl me out the door
Jose got me stumbling, mumbling like a fool
That worms got a kick like a Tennessee mule
Wake up in the morning, hurting head, skinned knees
Ain't no doubt about what's putting a whooping on me

[Chorus]
Tequila goes down easy, Lord, it sneak up on me fast
Tequila, great big buzz in a little bitty glass
Tequila

[Verse 2]
Glass, salt, straight up, chilled lemon, lime
Blue on the rocks, frozen margarita's time
Mexicali, Blue Agave, fire in a bottle
Too much Cabo Wabo, do the Cucharacha wobble
You think by now a drinking man would learn
You don't go toe to toe with that little bitty worm

[Chorus][x3]
