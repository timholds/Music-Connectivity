[Intro]
Yeah!

[Hook]
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm smoking all of this weed baby, just to forget you
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm drinking all of this drank baby, just to forget you
(forget you, forget you)
Mama told me you could catch  a bird with a breadcrumb
Hunnid niggas standin' outside, screamin' "Redrum!"
Try to make a hunnid million dollars ‘fore the Feds come
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb

[Verse 1]
Redrum, redrum
Man they say the money talkin', you ain't said none
I'ma stack a hunnid million for the feds come
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb
Right wing, left wing, house got a right wing, left wing
Is my ex 'ting, texting, my next 'ting?
With your bitch face resting, I just think
Maybe you was never nothing but a slide through
I know you never loved me, even though you tried to
'Member way back when I missed the days back then
I went to school high, never went to high school
Drug diet, drug diet, we had chemistry baby, I love science
The love dying, the love dying, sippin' purple rain 'tilI hear the doves cry

[Hook]
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm smoking all of this weed baby, just to forget you
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm drinking all of this drank baby, just to forget you
(forget you, forget you)
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb
Hunnid niggas standin' outside, screamin' "Redrum!"
Try to make a hunnid million dollars ‘fore the Feds come
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb

[Verse 2]
I remember when my doors closed, and the crib got foreclosed
Now I'm like fuck a wardrobe, this whole winter I just wore robes
Diamonds looking like it's morse code, hit you in your torso see your whole soul
Mixin' lean up in the orange soda, bitch I think I might just need a organ donor
Yeah I remember trappin' on the motorola
On the dolo, on the dolo
Feds' trynna flick a photo
On the low the fish tailin' in a new four door
In the new four door, fish tailin' in a new four door
With a couple hoes, two bad one ugly like total
God damn I got it!

[Hook]
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm smoking all of this weed baby, just to forget you
Fuck the day that I met you
Fuck the day that I met you
I'm drinking all of this drank baby, just to forget you
(forget you, forget you)
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb
Hunnid niggas standin' outside, screamin' "Redrum!"
Try to make a hunnid million dollars ‘fore the Feds come
Mama told me you could catch a bird with a breadcrumb
