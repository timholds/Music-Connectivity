[Hook]
I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, I put the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my name
You 'bout that - 'bout that, then it ain't no thing
I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, nigga, the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my crown
If she 'bout that pole she keep it going around and around

[Verse 1]
I put that piece on chain, it cost me a grip
If rapping is acrobatics, I'm making it flip
Fuck what you heard, fuck on the curb
It shine like a light
If hoes don't start emerging you ain't doing it right
You just new to the game, you ain't been in the field
I was sharpening mine, tryna' go for the kill
Tryna' get me a mill, fly a private Alliance
Tell 'em 'probably never land, keep it going 'round and around
Highly anticipated, I'm on it and motivated
Told 'em it ain't nothing to claim and it's complicated
Sitting on Mount Olympus, sending out smoke signals
Word to my unborn, niggas ain't fucking with us
Since I was in Granny's kitchen I knew I'd get grater later
Fast-forward ten years, my crib need an elevator
Krizzle, back in time, swangin' and coming down
Motherfuck stand still
Going round and around

[Hook]
I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, I put the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my name
You 'bout that - 'bout that, then it ain't no thing
I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, nigga, the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my crown
If she 'bout that pole she keep it going around and around

[Verse 2]
I put the piece on chain, the whip on swang
I'm fuck all them busty bitches that fuck with a king
I saw it all from the rooftop, condo clockin' figures
Fingers is swollen, my wrist has been fucking with me
I whip-whip on it, muddy water - sip on it
She gon' suck the soul out me if I put the tip on it
I throw on a rubber, dive under covers and go to town
Can't fuck it raw, that pussy going round and a round
Stay off and play em all, my flexes been activated
Moving at top speed, haters is hesitating
All about power plays, scoring to make a move
Call up an audible, we lift them laws and come through
Gotta be realistic, I stack it and make it work
It ain't worth getting if you don't get it right out the dirt
They heard that I'm back in time, trunk knocking underground
Rotating deuce twice
Going round and around

[Hook]
I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, I put the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my name
You 'bout that - 'bout that, then it ain't no thing
I put the piece on chain, the piece on chain
The piece on chain, nigga, the piece on chain
Forever a king, I put that on my crown
If she 'bout that pole she keep it going around and around
