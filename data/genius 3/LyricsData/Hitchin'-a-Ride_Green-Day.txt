[Violin Intro]

[Verse 1]
Hey mister, where you headed?
Are you in a hurry?
Need a lift to happy hour
Say, "oh no"
Do you brake for distilled spirits?
I need a break as well
The well that inebriates the guilt
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 2]
Cold turkey's getting stale
Tonight I'm eating crow
Fermented salmonella, poison oak no
There's a drought at the fountain of youth
And now I'm dehydrating
My tongue is swelling up
I say one, two, one, two, three, four

[Refrain]
Troubled times, you know I cannot lie
I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride

[Bridge]
There's a drought at the fountain of youth
And now I'm dehydrating
My tongue is swelling up, I say...
Shit!

[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Troubled times, you know I cannot lie
I'm off the wagon and I'm hitchin' a ride

[Outro]
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
(Don't know where to go) Hitchin' a ride
Say birthday boys, hey!
