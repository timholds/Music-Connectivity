[Part 3]

[Verse 1]
Following the path as it leads towards
The darkness in the north
Weary stranger’s faces show their sympathy
They’ve seen that hope before

[Chorus]
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can’t delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can’t catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

[Verse 2]
Mist is swirling, creatures crawling
Hear the roar get louder in your ears
You know the folly was your own
But the force behind can’t conquer all you fears

[Chorus]
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can’t delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can’t catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way

[Verse 3]
Throw your thoughts back many years
To the time when love was life with every morning
Perhaps a day will come
When the lights will be as clear as on that morning

[Chorus]
And if you want to stay for a little bit
Rest your aching limbs for a little bit
For you the night is beckoning
And now you can’t delay
You hear the night birds calling you
But you can’t catch the words they say
Close your ears and eyes, be on your way
