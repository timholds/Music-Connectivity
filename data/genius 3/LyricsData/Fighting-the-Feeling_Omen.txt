Nobody told me there'd be days, there'd be days like this
Nobody told me there'd be days, there'd be days like this

Would you believe me if I told you that I've never cheated?
Probably not, but I swear to you, it's no misleading
I got some things I've been dealing with that make me question
Is my mindset still innocent?
She got my heart true, but she got my hormones
Imagine her screaming the sounds that a whore moans
Lord knows that I love her so, but it seems as time passes, I wonder more
What're these other women like? Don't even wanna know them
I just wanna spend the night, I know that that's immoral
But that's what I feel, aight? I'm trying to be truthful
But all you do is lie to me and say the feeling's mutual
Holding on to pride while I'm holding on the fear that one day
I may have to be unfaithful to my dear, and I can't fight the feeling now
Don't even know what I'm feeling now

I'm fighting the feeling
Everyday I'm on the verge
And I can't seem to kick the urge
Fighting the feeling
I can't speak what's on my mind
Guess it's been building over time
Fighting the feeling
And now it's got me all confused
All I know is I don't wanna lose
Fighting the feeling
I'm fighting the feeling

I know I feel guilty, I kinda think I'm wrong
Cause I just want you to stay while I linger on
And that ain't fair at all
We in a gray area now and I barely call
Yet somehow you still got my soul, I bare it all
But you don't care at all, don't wanna hear my song
You heard it all along, I'm caught up in a "Jonz in my Bonz"
Got my "Brown Sugar" going like, kinda like D'Angelo's poems
But baby I'm still him, baby I'm still Damon
Same old G, I'm just hoping you still patient
Same old me, been the same since in the playpen
And I never change, I'm remaining til my days end
I'm kinda paranoid, I don't trust someone
I've been feeling some things I wanna run from
Like something inside my heart is undone
Busy wondering where did this lust come from

Fighting the feeling
Everyday I'm on the verge
And I can't seem to kick the urge
Fighting the feeling
I can't speak what's on my mind
Guess it's been building over time
Fighting the feeling
And now it's got me all confused
All I know is I don't wanna lose
Fighting the feeling, yeah
I'm fighting the feeling

Nobody told me there'd be days, there'd be days like this, no
Nobody told me there'd be days, there'd be days like this
You never told me there'd be days, there'd be days like this, no
Nobody told me there would be days like this

Now how do I clear the mixed emotions?
Can't go to mama now, I think I need some different coaching
Oh wait, too late, see now she left me
That's probably cause I left her
Wonder should I text her, but I don't wanna stress her
But all the stress I'm feeling now might leave me on a stretcher
Oh wait, extra extra, my best friend is a snake, spreading lies on the regular
I also lost my job though, feel my heart- I need a check-up
And now I need her more than ever, but on the flip side
I'm still thinking horny pleasures, I swear that sometimes I'm so dumb
And I would love for my temptation here to go numb
Don't even drink, yet I'm so drunk
And this is weird, though I never ever acted on my impulses
I told you that I never cheated, but listen closely
You see, everything ain't always about your actions
Sometimes you can have an inappropriate attraction

Everyday I'm on the verge
And I can't seem to kick the urge
Fighting the feeling
I can't speak what's on my mind
Guess it's been building over time
Fighting the feeling
And now it's got me all confused
All I know is I don't wanna lose
I'm fighting the feeling, yeah
I'm fighting the feeling, yeah
