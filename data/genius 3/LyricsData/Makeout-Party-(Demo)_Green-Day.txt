Oh you got yourself a pretty little mouth
I think i wanna rub it the wrong way
Do you wanna spin the bottle? Play a game of Chicken?
It's a tongue twister 'till your lips are bleedin'

Oh anyhow, Anywhere
Kiss me there!
Oh, Kiss Me There!
Scream and shout!
Truth or Dare?
Kiss me there!
Oh kiss me there!

You're so precious you're a fucking delinquent
I got myself Jonesin' and i need some fixin'
It's a makeout party from another dimension
Oh it's gonna get crowded with some bad intentions!
WOW!

Oh anyhow, Anywhere
Kiss me there!
Oh, Kiss Me There! WOW!
Scream and shout!
Truth or Dare?
Kiss me there!
Oh kiss me there!

WOW!
[Screams]
WOO!
