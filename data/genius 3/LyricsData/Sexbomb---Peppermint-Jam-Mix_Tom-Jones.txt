Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on
Turn me on, turn me on, turn me on, turn me on

Spy on me baby, use satellite
Infrared to see me move through the night
Aim, gonna fire, shoot me right
I'm gonna like the way you fight

Now you found the secret code I use
To wash away my lonely blues
So I can't deny or lie
'Cause you're the only one to make me fly

S** bomb, s** bomb, you're a s** bomb
You can give it to me when I need to come along
S** bomb, s** bomb, you're my s** bomb
And baby you can turn me on

Now don't get me wrong, ain't gonna do you no harm
This bomb's for lovin' and you can shoot it far
I'm your main target, come and help me ignite
Love struck, holding you tight

Make me explode although you know
The route to go to s** me slow
And yes I must react to claims of those
Who say that you are not all that

S** bomb, s** bomb, you're my s** bomb
You can give it to me when I need to come along
S** bomb, s** bomb, you're my s** bomb
And baby you can turn me on

S** bomb, s** bomb, you're my s** bomb
You can give it to me when I need to come along
S** bomb, s** bomb, you're my s** bomb
And baby you can turn me on

You can give me more and more, counting up the score
You can turn me upside down inside out
You can make me feel the real deal
I can give it to you any time because you're mine

Who say that you are not all that
S** bomb, s** bomb, you're my s** bomb
And you can give it to me when I need to come along
S** bomb, s** bomb, you're my s** bomb
And baby you can turn me on

S** bomb, s** bomb, you're my s** bomb
And you can give it to me when I need to come along
S** bomb, s** bomb, you're my s** bomb
And baby you can turn me on

And baby you can turn me on, baby you can turn me on
And baby you can turn me on, baby you can turn me on
Yeah baby you can turn me on, baby you can turn me on
Well baby you can turn me on
