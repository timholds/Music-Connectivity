[Verse 1]
Where would I be without you honey
Baby I'm me, all because I love you
Oh you know the cars and the clothes and the cribs and the bankrolls
Are nothing without your loving
Although you might hear that in every love song
It's just what I feel so I'm going to keep on, keep on, singing you praises in everyway I think of
And this is what I mean love

[Chorus]
When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf
When I see you baby, I just got to tip my ha-a-at
Because when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, you're the greatest part of me
And darling you are fi-i-ine
When I see you baby, I just can't believe you're mi-i-ine
Because when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, the greatest part of me

[Verse 2]
I said you're the shh and here's my proclamation
My way of saying thank you for your dedication
Now I can spend the rest of my life sitting high up on cloud nine
And all because I know I'm your lady
And no don't nothing get better than this we steady stacking chips together
Coping gifts and taking trips and spend it on each other
No other can do-do what you do, because baby you're the truth and that's why I got to tell you that

[Chorus]

[Outer]
Oh-oh-oh-oh..oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oohhh (the greatest part of me)
Oh-oh-oh-oh..oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oohhh, see when I'm looking at you baby, all i see is...the greatest part of me
Oh-oh-oh-oh..oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooohhh, the greatest part of me
Oh-oh-oh-oh..oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooohhh (the greatest part of me)
Oh-oh-oh-oh..oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ooohhh
