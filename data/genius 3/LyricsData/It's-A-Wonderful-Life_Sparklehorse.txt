[Verse 1]
I am the only one
Can ride that horse, th'yonder
I'm full of bees who died at sea

[Chorus]
It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life

[Verse 2]
I wore a rooster's blood
When it flew like doves
I'm a bog of poisoned frogs

[Chorus]
It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life

[Bridge]
I'm the dog that ate
Your birthday cake

[Chorus]
It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
It's a wonderful life
