I saw a letter lying on tha floor
I couldn't help but look inside
Thought it was something that you must've left...
Left there for me to find
All the words were on that page
All my dreams came true that day...
I found
Your letter...
Your letter...
It said you loved me but you didn't know the words to say
It said you never knew that you could ever feel this way
It said you only wished someday that I would feel the same
In your letter
Your letter
I guess it just never occurred to me...
That you would feel the way I did
You kept the sweetest secret from my heart
You kept those feelings hid...
No you never showed a sign
Give me proof to what I would find...
Inside your letter
Your letter
It said you loved me but you didn't know the words to say
It said you never knew that you could ever feel this way
It said you only wished someday that I would feel the same
In your letter
Your letter
I was so happy that I almost cried
To think that you would think of me that way
It's like you took my sweetest dream
And may then you made that dream come true
I would be with you...
Always...
I saw a name I didn't recognize
I felt the tears had come to my eyes
Seems that the love that you've been longing for
Was another love not mine
No you never showed a sign
But it was rite there in the lines
Inside your letter
You letter
It said you loved him but you didn't know the words to say
It said you never knew that you could ever feel this way
It said you only wished someday that he would feel the same
In your letter
Your letter
I saw a letter lying on tha floor

I found your letter
