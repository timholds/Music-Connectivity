Has she found a way to make her man work out rite
An' has she found a way to let her man into her life

Has she found a way to teach her man some control
Oh to make him understand her, as a whole

Will she find a way to tell him just how lost she is
An' will he find a way to lead her out of the wilderness

Take her by surprise, and not by force
Oh able to withstand, all her storms

In the wilderness..things aren't what they seem
In the wilderness..life is but a dream
That flows on..that flows on...

Will he find a way to let her play such a sacred role
Will she find a way to forgive him as a whole

Oh how can he have been so blind for so long
An' how can the woman I love, be so strong

In the wilderness..things aren't what they seem
In the wilderness..life is but a dream
That flows on..that flows on...
