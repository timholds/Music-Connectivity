I took on the rain
I tried to try
It doesn't even matter
How hard i cry
It's always the same
The winds will blow
My solemn face will start to show

Is it for me
Or someone else?
Seem to trading life
For wealth
Or am i just breathing
Like i should?
Thinking of leaving
For the greater good

These roads are my best friend beneath our tyres
These roads don't make me sick, don't make me tired

I'm tripping on the same cable every time
Not playing the game, yes i think i am blind
I'm tripping on the same cable every time
Not playing the game
The game

I miss you like hell
My open friend
You are my light
In the tunnel at the end
And you introduced me
To the world
You introduced me
To a girl
There's plenty of them
It's easy
But plenty of you
Means lots of me
Thinking of leaving
For the greater good
Maybe I'll pay
Like I should

These roads are my best friend beneath our tyres
These roads don't make me sick, don't make me tired

I'm tripping on the same cable every time
Not playing the game, yes i think I am blind
I'm tripping on the same cable every time
Not playing the game
The game

These roads are my best friend beneath our tyres
These roads don't make me sick, don't make me tired

I'm tripping on the same cable every time
Not playing the game, yes i think I am blind
I'm tripping on the same cable every time
Not playing the game
The game

These roads are my best friend beneath our tyres
These roads don't make me sick, don't make me tired
