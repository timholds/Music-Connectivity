Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out

Sometimes when I watch you
I stretch out my hand to touch you
Cause it drives my me wild
To see you flutter by
You butterfly

I won't squeeze you dead
Aiming through your head
I just want your love

I wonâ€™t write your name
In Latin in a frame
Cause framing is a chain

Listen all you girlies
Even though I haven't met you
Gonna catch you soon
In my butterfly net
You'd better watch out
