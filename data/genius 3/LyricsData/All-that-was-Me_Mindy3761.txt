Here I stay listening in
M n M candy rapped in sin
Tears stream down the story's told
All too familiar a burning a hole

Through all that's me
All that is me

Awash the waterfalls and pools
See the same from different schools
Ended stories never end
Floodgates crash the mind in bend

Through all tranquility
All that is me

Poems and songs circle round
Vultures devour my every sound
End this story that is not real
Soul died now re=souled reveal

Through it all just to be
All that is me

Some Stars dim and some stars glow
Shooting stars don't ever know
Shooting straight in a circle
Looking to rhyme a word with purple

Through it all it was me
All that was HE
