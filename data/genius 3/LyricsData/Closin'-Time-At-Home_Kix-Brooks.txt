[Verse 1]
Well, I have been staring at you all night long
Pretty as a picture
Sitting this close with the lights down low
Hits me right in the ticker
Nobody's pulling the plug on the jukebox
Nobody's saying that's your last beer
Nobody's yelling I don't care where you go
But you can't stay here

[Chorus]
When it's last call, no worries
Bartender ain't making us hurry
One thing's for sure, we ain't leaving alone
When it's closing time
When it's closing time
When it's closing time I'm at home

[Verse 2]
Right about now I'd be walking you out
To some dusty old parking lot
Waiting on a cab to take us to some other
Late night hot spot
Ain't no crowd here fighting for a slow dance
Or some ole cowboy trying to cut in
Yeah, I'd rather be here alone in the kitchen
Doing my best to get lucky again

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
No, we ain't got to worry about them stacking up the barstools
Sweeping up the broke glass
Throwing out the drunk fools
When it's closing time at home

[Outro]
When it's closing time
When it's closing time
When it's closing time I'm at home
