Stepped off the spaceship, pray Orion’s arm’ll hold us close
Let’s get intoxicated by my sound, almost overdosed
It’s conscious lyrics from the spirit ‘til we’re comatose
But right now hold the phone ‘cause you can’t find imitations
I’ll send chills down your spine, that’s divine inspiration
Now we can show growth and sow seeds of co-existence
Learn to know hope and proceed to go the distance
‘Cause it’s time to free your mind from the confines of this prison
So, beat greed! ‘Cause we need to survive
It’s a disease that’ll feed on us, eat us alive
See as for me, I just want my piece of the pie
I take off, and wave goodbye, as we’re leaving the sky
And why?

[Hook]
They sent me out on a solo mission
I get to fly good vibes across the solar system
Boys to men, all my women and girls
Let’s send this feeling out all across the world
They sent me out on a solo mission
I get to fly good vibes across the solar system
Boys to men, all my women and girls
Let’s send this feeling out all across the world

Lexicon verse

Faced with these scenes of destruction
Silent screams ‘n fiends basin’ they need to get touched with
The hands of God
Cuttin’ sour deals ‘ll get you in a pickle
They fickle, don’t give me five boy ‘cause I ain’t got no nickels
My partna’ a felon, yet his dope was high grade
The dreams they sellin’ crush the dreams you can make
We need a change, but these kids bull headed like Jordan
‘Cause pennies (Penny) take their heart away (Hardaway)
Modern day fix the tools on the corner
Elevated from the slums and favelas, say I come to be a failure
So my momma tell ‘em
My craft (kraft) is renowned, so I gets the cheese
But the money secondary to the minds I can free
Lexicon baby

[Hook]
