I guess I gave my best for the both of us tonight
They're not just words to me, so listen when I speak
I'll see this through

Do what you can
Be what you need
Be what you like

Do what you can
Be what you need
Be what you like
We're not so far away

Do what you can
Be what you need
Be what you like

It's your turn to rise
Occasion will call you out tonight
You're not just somebody I met along the way
I'll keep coming through for you

Do what you can
Be what you need
Be what you like

Do what you can
Be what you need
Be what you like
We're not so far away

Do what you can
Be what you need
Be what you like

You know love isn't justice, don't get confused
It's not always convenient
You just have to choose
Do you believe

We're not so far away

Do what you can
Be what you need
Be what you like
We're not so far away
