[Intro]

[Verse]
Clenching my teeth tight
My head is like a sponge
Give it to me free

[Chorus]
I wanna get ripped off
And drown in the airwaves
Another fatal wreck
On the information highway
So go ahead and kill yourselves
It all amuses me
For I'll be damned to spend my life in hell
Another wise ingrate

[Verse]
Bring me blood and pain
Of a stranger's fate
Give it all away
Give it to me now
I'm desensitized
I wanna watch a bomb
Blow the masses high

[Chorus]

[Verse]
Bring me blood and pain
Of a stranger's fate
Give it all away

[Chorus]
