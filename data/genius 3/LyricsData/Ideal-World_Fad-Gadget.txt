As I dream, I live
And as I sleep, I walk
So close the door, turn down the lights
And let me dream it again
So close the door, turn down the lights
And let me dream it again
Oh, live it again

No stress, no death
When you fall you wake
And feel no pain (feel no pain)
No stress, no death
When you fall you wake
And feel no pain

In an ideal world
In an ideal world
In an ideal world
In an ideal world

As you sleep, I'm here
I feed your dreams
So sit you down, plug in, switch on
And we'll play it again
So sit you down, plug in, switch on
And we'll play it again
I'll run it again

No stress, no death
When you fall you wake
And feel no pain (feel no pain)
No stress, no death
When you fall you wake
And feel no pain

In an ideal world
(Dreams become reality, living in an ideal world)
In an ideal world
In an ideal world
(Reality is just a scheme, living in an ideal world)
In an ideal world

And the sun never shines in my ideal world
I said the sun always shines in an ideal world
So it's plug in, switch on, in my ideal world
So let's turn down the light and dream it again
In an ideal world
No stress, no death, when you fall, you wake
In an ideal world
Cos the sun always shines and I feel you pain
In my ideal world
In my ideal world
In my ideal world
Let me plug in, let me switch on
Let me plug in, let me switch on
Cos you feed my dreams
Let me plug in, let me switch on
Cos you feed my dreams, as I sleep
In my ideal world
