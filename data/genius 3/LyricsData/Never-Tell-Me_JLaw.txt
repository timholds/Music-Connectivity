Verse 1 (JLaw)

Man this shit started off real fuckin' dirty
Strap with the .30 like my name Steph Curry
God got me through it all so i don't fall
You stop fearin' niggas when you know you got it all
Came a long way from that butter and toast
Yeah came a long way feelin' ....
All my niggas round me they be talkin' them bands
Black white purple pink you can all get them hands
Can't stress over a bitch that is what i was told
Hit it couple times and the pussy get old
I been fuckin' broke for way too long
So i'm bout to get this money through these muhfuckin' songs
They never fuckin' tell me that the nigga ain't shit
This the same nigga grew up that that ole take ya bitch
Went from a dime to a quarter a bench to a starter
Lost all the weight then a nigga got taller
Now the bitches wanna fuck me hoes wanna suck me
I ain't never took a loss yeah you niggas know me
Run forest run or get hit with this drum
Call me DJ Khaled cause i'll win another one

Verse 2 (N8)

Started off with something slight now imma keep flowin'
Someone better stop me like the first law of motion
Came in the game causing all this commotion
Niggas tryna ride my wave but can't swim in the ocean
Nate the rapper nope not my name no more
Came up on this beat so you know i'm bout to score
I was raised in the jungle yeah you know that's where I been
People gettin' handouts yeah you know i'm grindin' for my shit
Carson on the beats and he's really killin' it
Tryna get out CBG man this town borin'
And N8 the new name so im swaggin' on this bitch
When the people hear this they'll be doin backflips

Verse 3 (JLaw)

She wanna play this hoe game but i can do it better
Ask me bout a bitch and i really won't sweat her
Now i'll wrap your bitch up i'll call it sweater weather
Yeah shawty bad so you better not test her
Your hoe will get slayed off a conversation yeah
And i fucked her twice as a compilation yeah
Last week i was gettin' head from a bitch
And she bit my dick so i binked her shit
Now i'm goin back in cause i don't play bout this paper
And i can give a damn about a muhfuckin' hater
Bitch is grindin' on me like a muhfuckin' skater
Now bring me my plate like a muhfuckin' waiter
You surprised these niggas got this mean ass flow
Yeah this black excellence i believe you gotta go
Houston Texas made me, Streets fuckin' raised me
Then give me my praise yeah you bitches need to pay me

Verse 4 (N8)

Me and JLaw goin' straight to the top
And you already know got the bitches on our cocks
Time goin' real slow like the hand on a clock
Hands up don't shoot not tryna get shot
When i buy these nice clothes cause you know that's how I dress
Tryna roll my check up workin' at Mad Mex
We're smokin' weed got caught now i got my dad stressed
Still tryna lay low gotta mind my business
