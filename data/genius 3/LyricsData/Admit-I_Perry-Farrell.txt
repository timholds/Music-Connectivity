Every set has its struggle
And every weak link gets double jinxed
Every has a cherry at the top
That must be house medic

Which comes first the end or the yoke?
Which is blessed to do or to don't?
If you don't admit you are like that
You are
So!

Admit
Admit I
Admit I, yo!
I admit, I admit I

You're afraid to die
Because you know
More than I
Why you don't
Prejudice is a lie
When you only love yourself
But you really don't

Which came first the seed or the oak?
Which is blessed to do or to don't?
If you don't admit you art like that
You are
So!

Admit
Admit I
Admit I, yo!
I admit I, I admit I

Everybody laughs in heaven
They see you but they're hidden
The virgin waits forever
She really wants to know you
But she don't

What's this place a flat or a round?
Does this up get up when it's down?
Left
Right down the middle
Must we go!

Admit
Admit I
Admit I, yo!
I admit I, I admit I

Your sex is tied to you
Like a sexy sex caboose
A sexy sex caboose
A sexy sex caboose
