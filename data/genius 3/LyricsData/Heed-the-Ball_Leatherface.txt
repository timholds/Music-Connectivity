The life and times of one and all living in the isle of dogs
Just waiting for a fall or for a telesales call
Am I anything at all I'm just an ugly ugly old fart
Why can't I understand at all why people think I'm not that tall
Whatever happened to that man who never relaxed his tightly clenched hand
He waived it at the sky against all things that fly
And you heed your own advice like you never said it
Just step back in time give or take a mile
You should heed your own advice say something a bit nice
You won't regret it
I could say that I love you but it's not quite true
I could say I'd die for you that's truer that's true
On that day I first met you I don't believe believe that too
And every little thing you do is more than magic now that's true
I should heed my own advice and wear someone else's shoes
And say something nice maybe about you
I should spend a little time just talking to you
I won't dread that
And on that day I first met you I don't believe believe that too
And every little thing you do is more than magic now that's true
Whatever happened to that man who never relaxed his tightly clenched hand
He waived it ever at the sky like he hated some things that fly
I should heed my own advice and wear someone else's shoes
And say something nice maybe about you
I should spend a little time just talking to you
I won't regret that
I should heed my own advice and say a thing nice
Heed my own advice say something nice
I should heed my own advice
