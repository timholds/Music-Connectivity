I caught the sun on my way home, my way home
I caught the sun on my way home, my way home
When I got lost in thinkin'
I missed the train on my way home, my way home
I missed the train on my way home, my way home
Cause I was still day dreaming
Oh, and I need to know
(Lucy, could you really be the one that I've been wishin' for?)
Are you the one? Are you the one?
(Lucy, I can't stop myself from wondering)
Yes, I need to know
Are you the one I've been waiting for?
(Are you the one I've been waiting for?)
I saw you blink and I missed your eyes, your blue eyes
I saw you blink and I missed your eyes, your blue eyes
When we were talkin' up stairs
What would I see if I looked in through the window?
What would I see if I look deep through the colored glass
In through the window?
Oh, cause I need to know
(Lucy, could you really be the one that I've been wishin' for?)
Are you the one? Are you the one?
(Lucy, I can't stop myself from wondering)
Yes, I need to know, are you the one? I need to know
(Lucy, could you really be the one that I've been wishin' for?)
Are you the one I've been waiting for?
(Are you the one that I've been waiting for?)
And I climbed up the hill, when I go home, when I go home
And I faced out towards you
What are you thinkin' over there, over there?
What are you thinkin' over there?
Oh, cause I need to know
(Lucy, could you really be the one that I've been wishin' for?)
Are you the one? Are you the one?
(Are you the one?)
Yes, I need to know, are you the one?
(Are you the one?)
(Lucy, I can't stop myself from wondering)
Yes, I need to know
(Lucy, could you really be the one that I've been wishin' for?)
Are you the one I've been waiting for?
(Are you the one that I've been waiting for?)
So, so long
(Are you the one I've been waiting for?)
For so long
