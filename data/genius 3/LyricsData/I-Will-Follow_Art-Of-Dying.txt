I know nothing is easy
For better or worse
I want you to see me
For all that it's worth

You need to know if I'm ready
For all that will follow
I'm through pretending
I'm here for it all

And I will follow
I will follow you
Into the highest of fires
The most violent storms
I will follow you

Like ending the season
I'm forever changed
You are the reason
I am no longer afraid
I'm not afraid

And I will follow
I will follow you
Into the highest of fires
The most violent storms
I will follow you

And I will follow
I will follow you
Into the highest of fires
The most violent storms

Oooh I will follow
I will follow you
Into the highest of fires
The most violent storms
I will follow you
