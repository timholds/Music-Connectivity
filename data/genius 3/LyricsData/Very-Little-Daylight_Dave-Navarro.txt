I always knew that the secrets could hurt me
I never knew it was yours that would kill me
I never tried to be yours to take care of
You never said you were mine to beware of

How many more will there be?

I only feel alone when I'm with you
Learning to pray
I could never be all that you want me to
I fall away

How many more will there be?

I'd never wish myself upon you
But I cut myself trying not to
If you can't share yourself with me
You're the person I thought that you would be

Another moment of silence without you
Barely alive
I figured out that I meant nothing to you
Bury me high

How many more will there be?
