[Verse 1]
Check this out baby
Yeah I'm not lost yet but you're losing me
I can't help but fear that things aren't the way they use to be
You don't dig what I choose to be
And I can't blame you I just wish that you could see
How much you really mean to me
And how much I want you to share this dream with me
I know you want a diamond ring
I remember when I use to treat you like a queen
But something died inside A feeling I can't hide
I never thought I'd be the guy to make you cry
Come on mija please dry your eyes
But these are feelings that I can't disguise
I never plan to say goodbye but you know I'm always down to give you one more try
Ay I really hope you're feeling me but I have to let you know this shit is killing me

[Hook]
We've come to the fork in loves road
And I think that both of us know (we know)
That the love that we share isn't there and it's time for us to let go (let go)
Time for us to let go (let go)
Say goodbye Cause I could no longer live a lie

[Verse 2]
Yeah We use to have a real good time remember that
I was yours and of course you were mine
I always thought that you were fine
I still do We're just walking on a fine line
Between love and hate but I can't hate you
I love you too much Don't want no one to replace you
We've gone through the ups and downs
And we've come too far to just say fuck it now
But if we say goodbye don't turn around
Get back together just to let each other down
And we can do without the tears
I want to kiss you on the neck and whisper in your ear
Let you know I still love you and make that clear
And how I wish that you were near
Or when we get together Something's wrong
It's either stay and work it out or get out and move on

[Hook]
We've come to the fork in loves road
And I think that both of us know (we know)
That the love that we share isn't there and it's time for us to let go (let go)
Time for us to let go (let go)
Say goodbye Cause I could no longer live a lie

[Verse 3]
Yeah You really got a hold on me
Love took control of me
This isn't how love is suppose to be
You're disrespecting me least at me disrespecting you
It's affected me and it's affected you
It's been awhile since I made you smile
I'm a thousand miles away and counting down the days
We really need to change our ways
But if we can't change I'm sure you'll be OK
You should trust in me in all you do
Have the same faith in me that I have in you
And I know love would see us through
Understand that I only see me with you
And no other girl would do
It's different I wanna give the world to you
I know we fight a lot and say some things
Lo siento I said a lot of things I didn't mean

[Hook]
We've come to the fork in loves road
And I think that both of us know (we know)
That the love that we share isn't there and it's time for us to let go (let go)
Time for us to let go (let go)
Say goodbye Cause I could no longer live a lie
