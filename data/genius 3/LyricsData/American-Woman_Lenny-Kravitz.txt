[Chorus 1]
American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama let me be

[Verse 1]
Don't come hanging around my door
I don't want to see your face no more
I got more important things to do
Than spend my time growing old with you

[Chorus 2]
Now woman, stay away
American woman, listen what I say

[Chorus 3]
American woman, get away from me
American woman, mama let me be

[Verse 2]
Don't come knocking around my door
I don't wanna see your shadow no more
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

[Chorus 4]
Now woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say

[Chorus 5]
American woman, said get away from me
American woman, listen what I say

[Verse 3]
Don't come hanging around my door
Don't wanna see your face no more
I don't need your war machines
I don't need your ghetto scenes
Colored lights can hypnotize
Sparkle someone else's eyes

[Chorus 4]
Now woman, get away
American woman, listen what I say

[Chorus 1]
American woman, stay away from me
American woman, mama let me be

[Bridge]
I gotta go, I gotta get away
Baby, I gotta go, I wanna fly away
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
I'm gonna leave you, woman
A-bye-bye, a-bye-bye
Bye-bye, bye-bye

[Outro]
(American woman) You're no good for me and I'm no good for you
(American woman) I look you right straight in the eye and tell you what I'm gonna do
(American woman) I'm going to leave you woman, you know I got to go
(American woman) I'm going to leave you woman, I got to go
(American woman) I got to go
I gotta go, American woman, yeah
