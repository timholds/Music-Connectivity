Come down off your throne and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason i've been waiting so long
Somebody holds the key
But i'm near the end and i just ain't got the time
And i'm wasted and i can't find my way home
Come down on your own and leave your body alone
Somebody must change
You are the reason i've been waiting all these years
Somebody holds the key
Chorus
But i can't find my way home
But i can't find my way home
But i can't find my way home
But i can't find my way home
Still i can't find my way home
And i ain't done nothing wrong
But i can't find my way home
