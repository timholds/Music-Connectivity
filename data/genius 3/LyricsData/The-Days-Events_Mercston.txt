Intro-
As well as the hits, are you gonna touch on serious subjects
And, and of course the subject
As to why you've been away for so long, a lot of people wanna know

Of course, that tunes written now, its written
I just need the write beat to do it cuz i wrote it so long ago and i feel the environment i wrote in got everything out that i needed
You know what I'm saying like my feelings, my emotions and everything so when i find that right beat
And  i'll know when i hear that, then everyone will hear the whole thing
I don't wanna go into it too tough. So now i present to you the days events!!!

(Mercston)
Yo (Listen)
Yo Yo
April the 16th Earls court, who would've thought
The days events would have bought me to court
But let me skip from the bottom to the cork
Its my side my time
Been waiting over two and half years to release the real side
Had a little support from grime
But i know some of your minds are confused
So, after i give you the real point of view
You be like innocence proof
Fuck news articles the truths in the booth no lies to subside
Mums life, mums life, mums life
I said it 3 times are you hearing me right
Our crew pulling up outside seeing rapid, slicks
A few other man den and stryds
They were like don't go inside it ain't live
But i had scholar on the line
Like mercs what you saying i got your ticket here holding
Are you rolling? I said yeah wait
Went up spudded the man dem and rolled in
Went inside i met fuda, anton his brother
Michael, lee, derrick and boob
I felt under dressed still looked the best
Anyway went ahead to the rewind seg
Was meant to feature but i missed the set
I see essentials stretch and her lil one butting in
Shouting a you can't bring it one
During that time bucked dirty danger on the outskirts
Couple gal short skirts
I weren't paying attention at first
Was ready to disperse to the main arena
Then i see shalina and mia
Two girls from the endz said hello
Chilled for a bit then i sighted devious
But let me skip close to the main period
We watched anon, kano and will smith
By now it was round about half 6
Dunno where the time went place weren't firing
I'm walking around was getting tiring
I think i was bought to go buy a drink
Then i see ghetts and bag of man looking to dan a man
No hyping
So we tried the trail but nutting went down
Left that crowd and ended up downstairs
And down there i spotted on of my old links
She was hosting some dance ting
So i stood around the side and eyed what was gwarning
There was a group there
For the life of me i can't remember the name
I just know it was a uk speed 2k
By now it was like suttin to 8 though
Bumped into one of my school mates noel
Reminisced for a bit and i was about to blow then he goes
Mercs
The girl rhiann keeps staring do you think she's on it
I was like brave she looks like vomit but its up to you
Then 2 2's there was two more to the spew and he went an introduced
There was drinking booze and looked kinda loose
The groupie love type
They lied and said they 17 that night (?)
And i thought they was lying
Anyway noel went for a stroll wit a fat ting
Within minutes there were bare man round him
Micheal and derrick were talking to the other two
There were double doors to go through we went through
Walking an talking ended us upstairs
There were two toilets there
My pipe was full so went to clear
Mike locked himself in the cube with amir
Dunno what went down but i come outta there
Within minutes we were back downstairs
I was back by the dance and they were over there
Man i shoulda left them man there
Uber came running downstairs second door to the left
The fat ones giving head so
Me, scholar and michael went where he said
They were in the printing room
And she was on her knees and her legs
Doing the rounds, sket!!
And to the right of the room sighted the girl that i called near
She's the reason i disappeared
But gimme a minute I'm gonna get there
So boom now the girl i labelled there
She weren't on it made it quite clear
Stayed outside fixed to a chair
After a few minutes security appeared
No hype just you's ain't supposed to be here
Said, if you wouldn't mind vacating the area
Then bopped right back to his chair
Scholar and amir weren't on the radar
We were looking to leave the arena
Tried belling him got no answer
So we searched went through a set of doors
See him in a room in the corner bust the door
He was on all fours
She was on her back no drawers
Going at it hard on the floor
We done a U turn and closed the door
She was enjoying what i saw
They were in there for about another 4
Outside our group amount was 4
Me, michael, derrick and booba no more
Scholar rolled out, i rolled in
She was getting dressed said i don't wanna have sex
I said alright she said how bout a shine
I replied like cool i don't mind
She then dropped my bottoms to (?)
And during the shine
The door got opened a couple times
She was like tell em there no more in line
I gotta meet my mates and its close to 9
So i told em she kept on going
Finished all  back and fourth holding
Then i bussed on the side of her clothing
I said soz and she wiped it off with the cuff of her cardigan top
Then we went outside conversated the lot
Its only then that i spotted the red spot
Close to you know what
I was like scholes say you didn't do it on her moulds
At that time everyone froze like
No that can't be i know you won't go
Low and behold she covered what was on show
Right now her face was on glow
Felt sick i was like heels, toes
Left them lot and resumed to the show
But they were back down in less than a mo
So i made a couple phone calls to link my so called
But then chilled for another ten
No pretending thats how the day went
Now I'm like time spent on what
Gym? fucking joke ting
I been gone for so long for nuffin
Look at my face so stripped no smile no nuffin
Go ahead you can cuss bet
Deep down your girls all wanna fuck yet
Anyways man back to the subject fuck sketz
Thats that
If i see her i wouldn't even thump her I'm cool as a cumber
Tru god sees everything under
So when things go wrong don't wonder
You know the answer
What goes around bites you back harder
We ain't from the same borough
But i tell you dis you gonna hear my voice regardless
All truth girl i filled the parts in

You see that
I hope that answers all questions
That you need to know the answers for
I may even talk about the course proceedings
At a later date
But for now, i just wanted to set the record straight
You can make your own judgements
Assumptions
I'll just continue making music in abundance
Yeah
I'm out
