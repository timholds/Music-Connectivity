You cried, you cried

Oh..

You've been living like a hobo in the hallways
Oh way too long
You've been sleeping in the doorway
Oh what's gone wrong?
And you cry like a baby
A baby whose mama's gone
As you holler from your squalor
Into the distance

The sisters of mercy will come (Praise)
Little sisters of mercy
The sisters of mercy will come
Little sisters of mercy

Father dear father
What's gone wrong?
Your boy that was proud and was angry, his spirit was overcome
He's calling for mercy, Oh, but no one phones
Into the cold black night
She stands alone
Oh father dear father
What have I done?

The sisters of mercy they come
Hail sisters of mercy
The sisters of mercy they come
Hail sisters of mercy
The sisters of mercy they come
Hail sisters of mercy

Mama mama
This is your boy
In this smile that you gave me there is sadness
There is no joy
I am weary I am lost and overcome
If my sadness my anger is swallowed
Oh mama mama
What went wrong? (Help me!)

The sisters of mercy they come
Hail sisters of mercy
The sisters of mercy they come
Hail sisters of mercy
The sisters of mercy they come
Hail sisters of mercy

Yeah..oh..

(Oh)(From Zion to Babylon)(You're weary now, you're hunrgy)
(We are frightened now)

Praise sisters of mercy
The sisters of mercy they come
Oh sisters of mercy

And the bells that will ring
They're calling from Zion to Babylon
We are weary we are lost
Like children
We are angry we are frightened
Oh mama oh mama what have I done?

The sisters of mercy they come
Hail sisters of mercy
The sisters of mercy they come
Hail sisters of mercy
The sisters of mercy they come
Hail sisters of mercy

Sisters of mercy
Sisters of mercy
