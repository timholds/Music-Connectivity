[Verse 1]
I heard about the rock for sometime, I know
It's easy to do when you feel the roll
Makes you want to get up, makes you wanna move your feet
No matter how it's done you know it can't be beat

[Chorus]
Because I can't stop rockin'
No, I can't stop rockin'
Well, I can't stop rockin'
Baby, until I lose my mind

[Verse 2]
Somebody said it's wrong but I know it's all right
Then it really hits you like a shot in the night
I'm never gonna stop as long as I can stay
Listen to me now, can't you hear me say

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I like to work it down low, I like to work it to the top
And when it starts rockin' I ain't never gonna stop
Get yourself loose, get yourself high
I love to feel the motion and I'm telling you why

[Chorus]
Because I can't stop rockin'
No, I can't stop rockin'
No, I can't stop rockin'
No matter what they do do do do do or say
No matter what you do do do do do or say, no no
