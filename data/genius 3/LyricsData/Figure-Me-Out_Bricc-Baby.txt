Got the trap bumpin' with a gas pad
Shit so loud you need a gas mask
Quit talkin' little nigga smoke pass pass
Quit talkin' little bitch I'm tryna' smash smash
My tatty lows killed a nigga for the cash fast
I ain't wrapped in tight nigga i need a cat scan
My country niggas in the a they call me Pac-Man
Cause if they pull up with the right they get the pack fast
Blue hunneds stashed in a blue rubber band
Nah bitch I could never be your other man
I run up in the bank with my gun in hand
Before I'm broke bitch I finnese a hunneds ban
Merk a nigga then I'm onto next flight to France
Me and brody on the molly fuckin' hoes again
Little niggas tryna' figure how my program
My kindest niggas sippin' lean wit the Bromance
