[Verse 1]
We get high in back seats of cars
We break into mobile homes
We go to sleep to "Shake Appeal"
Never wake up on our own

[Chorus]
And that's the way we get by
Way we get by
And that's the way we get by
Way we get by

[Verse 2]
We go out in stormy weather
We rarely practice discern
We make love to "Some Weird Sin"
We seek out the taciturn

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We found a new kind of dance in a magazine
Tried it out it's like nothing you ever seen
You sweet talk like a cop and you know it
You bought a new bag of pot, said let's make a new start

[Chorus]
And that's the way to my heart
The way to my heart
That's the way we get by
Way we get by

[Outro]
We get high in back seats of cars
We put faith in our concerns
Fall in love to "Down on the Street"
We believe in the sum of ourselves
I said that's the way we get by
