[Bridge: Swizz Beatz]
The party's in your glass, you fill it up until you hit the roof

She acting like a white girl drunk and she outta control but I'm feeling that bitch
Drop it like you owe it to me, give it to me like it's mine in the first place
Lady in the street, freak in the bed, wild in the party, professional in the workplace
She independent and sexy I think I love her man, she keep it clean but get messy under the cover man
Dirty yeah you know it clap your ass, if you dirty and you know it clap your ass
She know how to do it like she the one who taught the class, that thing so fat I need somewhere to sit my glass
