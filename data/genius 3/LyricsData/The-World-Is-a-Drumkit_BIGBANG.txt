If we could just
Just listen
Listen to...
The sounds are all there
The world is a drumkit
Ice building snow melting
Children laughing boulder crashing
The world is a drumkit
Someones key in the door
Late at night
Strangers singing
Blood running
The world is a drumkit
The world is a drumkit
All you need is a drumkey
Key
