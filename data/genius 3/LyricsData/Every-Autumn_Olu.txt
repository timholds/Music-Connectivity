[Verse 1]
Hit me with the super sonic, like a Zubat
Thats why I keep running
Like how the fuck could you do that?
Almost thought I would move back
Now I remembered why I dipped
Cause most of y'all think differently
Than I ever did
Small town livin', everybody know each other
You get bored, so you just got to enjoy each other
Ain't no place to breath, ain't no place to grow
Ain't no place for me
And you know me, I like to flow
But that shit was like a dead end
Good times but nothing else
Close minded, but I broke the mold
And did it well
Fucked my reputation up the whole time
But I couldn't tell
And to you locals who hating
I'll see you in hell
Met a girl when I was out there
But she fucked me up
Even after I was out there
She still fucked me up
My worst move was ever giving her just enough
Had nothing left to myself, i was out of luck

[Hook]
Spend every autumn
Thinking about living on South Summit
I met some good people
And I met some others
But every autumn
It gets tougher to remember
Imma keep you in my thoughts
Til' you're replaced with one another

[Bridge]
It ain't about where you grew up
It's who you grew up with
And most of y'all stick together
Which I will surely miss
And those who were a hit and miss
I couldn't give a shit
But every autumn
I just hope that you'll be hearing this

[Verse 2]
Playing Pokemon, drinking coke and rum
Friday night, ?
But washing dishes at my 9-5
To pay my rent
Been working full time
Cause this semester I will not attend
?, you niggas snorting coke for fun
I had to get up out
Usually I'm not the type to run
But it'd take anything but the truth
For me to want you
I'm a city boy, you too fuckin' country
I wondered what could have stick around
In a town where every body is down
To get around and around and around
Like a roller coaster
You got me nauseous
Now I every time i feel like spitting game
I will be cautious
And they were wrong about me
Yeah they were, and I'm about to prove it
Cause I was wrong about you to
But you already proved it
That was really stupid
I'm too young for this
I'm outy, if you need me I'm in Cinci
On some other shit, I'm done with this
