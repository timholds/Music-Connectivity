I'm runnin' out of room
Don't make me say it
There's nothin' left in me
Don't make me
Too much for hotel rooms
Don't make me say it
Sleeping pills don't make me

There is no love left in your eyes
There is love between your thighs
Roll over say goodnight
A morning dog howl in the street
Cuff your tiny hands and feet
Napkin in the drain

I'm runnin' out of room
Don't make me say it
There's nothin' left in me
Don't make me
Too much for hotel rooms
Don't make me say it
Sleeping pills don't make me

There is no love left in your eyes
There is love between your thighs
Roll over say goodnight
I hate my life, I hate my life
Never want another wife
I want the life you think I have
Think I have...
Think I have...

There is no love left in your eyes
There is love between your thighs
Roll over say goodnight
I've had enough of feelin' sick
Had enough of feelin' sick
The sugar never helps
I hate my life, I hate my life
Never want another wife
I want the life you think I have
Think I have
(have, have)
Think I have
(have, have)
Think I have
(have, have)
