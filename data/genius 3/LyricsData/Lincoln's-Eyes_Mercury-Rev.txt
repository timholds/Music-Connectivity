What explodes like a fractal
Pops like a lite bulb
Looks really awful
At four in the morning
Moves with a dead stare
Coils around your ankles
Fangs long as neckties
And strike without warning

What implodes like a Zeppelin
Cracks like pavement
Smokes in the basement
And knows when yer lying
Comes to a dead stop
Forgives you like Jesus
Cold as a windchill
With eyes like Abe Lincoln

What is dark like a birthmark
Pulls like a magnet
Male and female
And covets like a dragon
Grows to a shark length
Contracts to amoeba
Lives in your soul
And loves you like I do

What appears like an angel
Stabs like a dagger
Fills you with lite
And bleeds you of matter
Comes to a dead stop
Forgives you like Jesus
Hands you a love only
Found in the Vedas

What explodes like a fractal
Pops like a lite bulb
Strolls in like Joel Gray
At four in the morning
Armed with a big nose
Fragile like a sea horse
Lives in your soul
And loves you like I do
