[Verse 1]
I believed in you
Thought what you said was true
It didn't occur to me
It was a lie

[Chorus]
Ha ha ha, silly wasn't I, oh...

[Verse 2]
I was lost in a world
And like a foolish girl
I really thought
You were my guy (unh)

[Chorus]
Ha ha ha, silly wasn't I, oh...

[Verse 3]
I remember the time
You called me on the phone
Said you'd had a busy day
You'd hurry home
I waited, I waited
Time went by
I tried to laugh
But all i could do was cry

[Chorus]
Silly, silly wasn't I

[Verse 4]
Oh wasn't I silly
To think I'd found the love
I was dreaming of
I never thought you would say goodbye

[Chorus]
Ha ha ha, silly ..oh

Wasn't I silly
To think that you loved me
Oh wasn't I silly ha ha ha
Silly
