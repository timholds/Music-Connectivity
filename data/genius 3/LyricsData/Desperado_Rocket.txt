[Verse 1: Rocket]
Yo, look, I wonder where rap goes
Nowadays everybody wanna trap though, whoa
Entiende, me no hablo español
Bruv, stop thinking you're Pablo
Way too Esco
With the bars, man are way too fresh though
Yeah, weed and a bottle of beer, that's our prep
Antonio flow, bare Desperados on deck
Pop that
Cause you know we getting pops for it now
When the girls round, do it like Kano
All you hear is pop, pop, pop, then we're out
Act up, then get (box in your mout)
Act up, then get boxed in the mout
Ain't talking 'bout crack but I called a girl Pookie
Cause she got rocks in her mout
I used to get in trouble all the time, my don
Another prick asking what sides I'm from
What ends I reside, all the time, like
You don't need to see the watch, you know the time, my don
Yeah, paid my dues, you don't know the amount
Fuck favours, I closed that account
Man are sipping on Morgan
Like "this is your captain, over and out"

[Hook: Rocket]
Man rolling round with the windows down
System blazing out
Hat down low, middle finger high
Living this ting called life
Check the mirror for the feds like (woop woop)
Still whipping through the ends like (woop woop)
Girl hit me with a text like (woop woop)
Said she with a couple friends like (woop woop)
Man rolling round with the windows down
System blazing out
Hat down low, middle finger high
Living this ting called life
Check the mirror for the feds like (woop woop)
Still whipping through the ends like (woop woop)
Girl hit me with a text like (woop woop)
Said she with a couple friends like (woop woop)

[Verse 2: Scorcher]
She was a crisp ting, buff ting, flee ting
Ex ting, fresh ting, new ting
She was over there acting on a rude ting
On a big bad bloodclart food ting
I popped two bottles and made the mood swing
On a mission impossible, Tom Cruise ting
I tapped Tee, I tapped Rocks on a smooth ting
And let 'em know that I got the blue ting
Lime and BACARDÍ
Got me feeling like life of the party
Brudda, I don't discriminate, lighty or darky
Like Kyze and Giggs, ride the punani
(Ride the punani)
Your friends wanna know what you're doing with Scorch
Tell 'em don't judge you cuh you ain't in court
But [?] more soon than you thought

[Hook: Rocket]
Man rolling round with the windows down
System blazing out
Hat down low, middle finger high
Living this ting called life
Check the mirror for the feds like (woop woop)
Still whipping through the ends like (woop woop)
Girl hit me with a text like (woop woop)
Said she with a couple friends like (woop woop)
Man rolling round with the windows down
System blazing out
Hat down low, middle finger high
Living this ting called life
Check the mirror for the feds like (woop woop)
Still whipping through the ends like (woop woop)
Girl hit me with a text like (woop woop)
Said she with a couple friends like (woop woop)

[Bridge: Tee]
Turn me up
Put the mic down
Hold tight the starmix, baby
Yeah
Too much money (too)
Gotta get that now (get that dough)
Driving in my car (driving in the car)
Gotta go far, far, far
Blackwall tunneling
Heading to my link's house
Blackwall tunnel
Heading to my link, link
Blackwall tunnel
Heading to my link's house
Heading to my link's house
I'm heading to my link's house
Heading to my link's house
Link's house, yeah
Heading to my link's house

[Outro: Kadey James]
Waviest flow
Told you before
Buss off the door
Buss off the, buss off the floor
Oh
