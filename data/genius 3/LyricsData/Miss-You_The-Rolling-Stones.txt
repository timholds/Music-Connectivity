[Verse 1]
I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you

[Chorus]
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh

[Verse 2]
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord I miss you
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say
Hey, what's the matter maaan?
We're going to come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls thats just dyiiiiing to meet you
We're going to  bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to

[Chorus]
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah

[Verse 3]
Oh everybody waits so long
Oh baby why you wait so long
Won't you come on! Come on!
I've been walking in Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm craaaazy
I've been stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people, ch ch ch What's the matter with you boy?
Sometimes I want to say to myself
Sometimes I say

[Chorus]
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh

[Verse 4]
I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord I won't miss you child
You've been blotting out my mind
Fooling on my time
No, I won't miss you, baby, yeah

[Bridge]
Lord, I miss you child

[Chorus]
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah
