ASHLEY!
Are you running around?
Are you crying out bloody murder?

ASHLEY!
Are you bumming around?
Are you crying on my cold shoulder?

You used to dangle my heart with your puppet strings
Dangled your desired right in front of my face
You led me to the well but wouldn't let me drink
I swallowed my pride and never even got the taste
But time comes around and I'm not so naive
I finally lost touch cause you're so out of reach
You say that you're fine but i know that you ain't
You're looking like hell and you're no fucking saint
