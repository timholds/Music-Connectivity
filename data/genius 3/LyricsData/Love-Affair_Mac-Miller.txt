[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Darling I, I’m waiting in the cold
Holding this umbrella for you
Raindrops make me feel romantic
Let’s run away, sail through the Atlantic
Two of us, such a wonderful pair
Stuck inside this love affair
Try to make you smile
If you was worth the while
The only one I call
All I do is hit redial
Why don’t you come and lay with me?
Let’s make a couple babies
I know we still so young
The idea seems crazy

[Hook]
Your love makes every day of mine worth it
Sometimes I wonder if I even deserve it
Look in my eyes, you know how I feel
I know it’s real, girl, let’s close the deal

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Darling, you and me strolling down the street
Talking about our dreams throwing pebbles
I wanna hear about everything you know
The places we could go, the songs that we could sing
The two of us, such a wonderful pair
Stuck inside this love affair
I know you like when I hold you tight
What’s your favorite color?
Let me know and I’ll paint the sky
And all I wanna do is make love till the morning
A one way ticket to paradise, the love train is boarding
(Baby lets go)


[Hook]
Your love makes every day of mine worth it
Sometimes I wonder if I even deserve it
Look in my eyes, you know how I feel
I know it’s real, girl, let’s close the deal
