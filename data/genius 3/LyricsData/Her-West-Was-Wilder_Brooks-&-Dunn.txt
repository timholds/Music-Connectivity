[Verse]
There's a picture of us in a bar, out in California
Eating fish Tacos an' drinking cold, cold beer
An' man we had the time of our lives
Yes, that was a very good year
Drove all the way up the coast of California
All the way the 101
One time we cruised all the way to Vancouver
Just to watch the setting sun, yeah
Just to watch the setting sun
Every time I looked in those far away eyes
I could see me getting left behind
I gave her my best
But her west was wilder than mine
Got lost in the desert an' found an Indian casino
An' she started rolling those nines
Stacking up the chips halfway to Heaven
Without even trying
We watched it all go at the roulette wheel
She let it all ride on the black
She said: "You can't keep what you never had
"Can't keep what you never had."
Laugh like the devil, howl at the moon
I knew I was losing my mind
I gave her my best
But her west was wilder than mine
An' I was gassing up in a dust storm outside of Sedona
She was chasing a tumble-weed
She flagged down a Kenwood, jumped in the cab
It was the last of her I'd ever see
It was the last of her I'd ever see
An' where the wild wind blows an' anything goes
As long as it's over the line
I gave her my best
But her west was wilder than mine
It was wilder than mine
There's a picture of us sin a bar, out in California
Eating fish Tacos an' drinking cold, cold beer
