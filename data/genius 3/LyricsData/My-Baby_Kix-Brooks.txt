[Verse 1]
She walked in the room and clicked off the T.V
Kicked her feet up on the chair
Said we're heading in different directions
And one of us gotta get outta here
Said hey baby let me make it easy
Ah maybe baby we can work things out
She lit up and said that my bags are packed
In two seconds flat like jumpin' jack flash she's gone

[Chorus]
Ah my baby's ain't coming back ah no
Ah my baby ain't coming back
My baby ain't coming back
Got a one way ticket on a one way track ya
My baby she's a hot tamoli
And my baby's burning up the road
My baby done flipped me the bird
No matter what you heard she ain't coming back no

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothing left but a cloud of dust
Tire tracks trough the whole front yard
She might think I'm coming back to chase her
But she ain't worth the miles I put on my car
I might be out in Oklahoma maybe down in Arkansas
Maybe up in Ohio
But what she don't know it don't hurt at all you all

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I heard a hemi comin up the driveway
Thinking maybe she's back tonight
That's just the boy's heading for the pool hall
Sometimes things just work out right yeah

[Chorus]
