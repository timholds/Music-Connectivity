[Verse 1]
Those haunting consequences
Left the spoiled taste of regret in my mouth

[Pre-Chorus]
Left to work it out alone
And when you fell asleep
Did you think of me?

[Chorus]
This is the closing of the day
And you escaped before I could reach out to you

[Verse 2]
Those crippled memories
All surge inside a lifeless mind
Passing time won't reconcile

[Pre-Chorus]
Left to work it out alone
And when you fell asleep
Did you think of me?

[Chorus]
This is the closing of the day
And you escaped before I could reach out to you

[Verse 3]
A sickness with no name
An antidote that won't bring you back

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
This is the closing of the day
And you escaped before I could reach out to you

[Outro]
And as you draw your final breath
Please forgive me
I will never forget you
