Intro:
I made this beat
Uh, Yeah
Alright I now wrote to it to
So would go like this It’s like
Really late and Germ’s tryin’ to get home
So I’mma try and one take a mofoking song

Verse:
When you first start rapping everybody curious
Then you make it happen and everybody furious
Young kid courteous, don’t know what the worry is
Wanna be burried in my Pittsburgh Jersey bitch
Nobody certain if you gonna make it
Life give you some hurtin’ and you gonna hate it
Sometimes it leave you cold and it leave you naked
But, one thing for certain I’ma leave it faded
Still young but I wonder when my time could be up
When my time come I’mma smiling peace up
Shorty sipping forties hanging out by the tree stump
So Jerm and me started making hits and it occurred to me
You didn't have to be like thirty-three to start earning cheese
With uncertainty, in it for eternity
Alot of style , a little money and some purple weed
Me and my queen, my girl, not Freddy Mercury
‘Cause you work for free, anything to get noticed
Stand focus ’cause bullshit it was hopeless
So treat yourself like a damn professional
Your first music check , damn incredible
Every day feel like the best day ever
‘Til every day feel like the best day ever
And you used to them days, kinda become a routine
You have a bad one, fuck up a good dream
You realize that you’ll probably be away when
All the people die and you never get to say
Everything you always wanted to but never got the chance to
Start to weigh you down, what can a man do?
I could’ve stayed around, probably cancelled couple of shows
Spend the last 2 years being dumb on the road
I guess, haven’t got to spend too much in my home
Time is what you make it, but playa don’t be mistaken
All of your shit get taken, broken beaten and wasted
Still I wouldn’t traded
And it was 5 o’clock but my mind won’t stop
I’ve been thinking ’bout life pour syrup on pop
Smoke a cigarette, it’s like I’m really trying to die
Trying to keep my head on my shoulders
But my mind in the sky
I’m that moment when a gazelle and a lion collide
I'm a burned down building with a diamond inside
Yup, independent platinum, wish you well passing
Jewelry out of the ice age, bitch outta Maxim
I’ll be writing this shit and just relaxin’
Let the time start passing

Outro:
Yeah, so I just made this muthafuckin' beat
And decided I was gonna rap on it too
It’s like ,Yup, took my chains off to rap this song
Uh, almost dropped my big chain
Who ever thought that I’d be standing in a booth with a big chain
Syke I’m joking I don’t got another verse
Alright Pete
