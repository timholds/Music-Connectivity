PART 1:
Paddling ghost makes it
Coast to coast makes it
Into the flames with the horse who made believe
Battles a guy makes a
Cross the night and he
Battles the flame it's the big stone place

There was a time they knew once more
Carried them down beneath the floor
Shovels in hand they dug too deep
Down to the flame that was his keep

Paddling ghost makes it
Coast to coast makes it
Into the flames with the horse who made believe
Battles a guy makes a
Cross the night and he
Battles the flame it's the big stone place

PART 2:
I've soaked my skin in the pits of hell
Yet I can't seem to escape the smell of sea
Like gloom it's smeared across my skin
Like a dirty black rust in my melody

Watch that one black night he
And the whole world whispers
