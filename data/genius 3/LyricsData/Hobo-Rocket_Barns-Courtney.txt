[Spoken intro]
Echo out the background a bit, right?
And to bring it, like, more focused
And you've got it, that's it
That's just as good as anybody

Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

[Verse 1]
When my feet touch down in a foreign land
I buried all my money in a coffee can
And I've been hobo skipping just to hide from the weather
Only got two pennies better rub them together
Because I keep it on my sleeve
I wear it on my shirt
I got a living room full of dust and dirt
And it's a jumped up living in the city of smoke
I better suck it up before I, I'm gonna fly

[Chorus]
I'm a hobo rocket
(Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey)
Wanna die, nothing in my pocket, yeah
(Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey)

[Verse 2]
When my shoes got holes in the cobble streets
And now it feels like heaven underneath my feet
I'm like a lone crusader on a holy endeavor
Living 5 pound daily in a charity sweater
Because I'm beating on my drum
I'm tapping on my knee
A street rat jamming to a Beck CD
You know I still got rhythm if I don't get paid
And I don't give a shit if I, I'm gonna fly

[Chorus]
I'm a hobo rocket
(Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey)
Wanna die, nothing in my pocket, yeah
(Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey)

[Outro]
(who who)
Alright, alright, alright (who who)
Alright, alright, alright (who who)
Alright, alright, alright (who who)
I tell them what I tell them and I do it every night
