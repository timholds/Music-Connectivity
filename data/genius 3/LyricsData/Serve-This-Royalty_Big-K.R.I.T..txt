[Intro: Female Voice]
Ah, the way the brother walks is beautiful, the way he talks is beautiful
Uh, the brother is beautiful
The way he makes love to me is beautiful
You know, that's my man!

[Hook: Cody ChesnuTT]
Platinum chains and rings is
All a brother knows now
Girl, you one of the first to know that
Gold is back in town
So you gotta serve this royalty
Believing in me and my dreams
Serving this royalty right
Trust what I say and what I see and we can get it

[Verse 1]
Yeah
Money, cars and clothes, and all the cribs
Never trust these lames and hoes cuz they ain't shit
Cuz theyâ€™ll just sink our dreams of things and jump ship
So we'll fly first class, full glass with blunts lit - float on
I shake the world if you hold on
Get your body off, just to turn your soul on
Your black is gold so when it dark, get your glow on
My words are heavy like a Chevy, shall I roll on?
Our love's unlimited
Vinyl record in the grooves of forever, bass and treble, bend this shit
Puff cut your affections like a painting God ain't finished with
Now had to be displayed so all these songs could say they finished it
I walk the talk so I can't run game
I'm the type of King that a need a Queen thats down to work and run things
I'm a lion baby, untamed
Before I devote my all I need to know one thing
Can you serve this royalty

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Whatever your heart desires
And to those that oppose our dreams and goals I set the world on fire
Go to war with giants of all kinds
So when you sleep without your King beside you you sleep fine
I be you knight in shining armor, swing down with a hammer like Thor for those that want drama
Travel high and low for those expensive garments that I
Peel off your frame after I fight in your honor
Cuz we can rule as far as the eye can see
If you down for the cause as long as your body breathe
Bet the heir that will proceed as Kings that's after me
But be colder than doors we close you'll have to be
There'll be tyrants that want nothing more than apathy
To defile on the kingdom of real and happiness
But history will whisper of our reign
Before I give my all, I need to know one thing
Can you serve this royalty

[Hook]

[Bridge: Cody ChesnuTT]
The dream is real if you serve this royalty
Leave your mama's house, make her proud
Serve this royalty right
From the valleys of Spain to the snowy banks of Maine
We can run this game
If you serve this royalty right

[Outro: Male Voice]
Thats right, she's behind me 100%, man
She believes in everything I believe in
And whatever I do, she go and ride along with me and do it at the same time, you know?
With no doubt in her mind cuz she know that I'm positive, and she knows that I'm out to get over, and she knows that I'mma try and get a piece of this country
