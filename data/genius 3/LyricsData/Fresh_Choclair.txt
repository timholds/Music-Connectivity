Trying to run with the Suave Dogs
(I can't get enough...)
You know about this right here? Right here?
Suave Dog shit
It's, it's like (Circle!)
People still be trying to talk but, you know, I really don't care
I kinda just be floating on peoples
Kinda just like just streamlining on peoples faces know what I'm saying?
I be looking right at you
Lotta people can't understand this shit right here, know what I mean?
But I be floating, doing my thing anyway, regardless
Know what I'm saying? It's like that..

I rock niggas off they blocks and leave 'em all in socks
The Chiznock leaving heads knots indeed
Chasin' me? You'll be tripping up - brush your knees
Talking heat in my face nigga? Brush your teeth
If you itching to get on brother, brush your fleece
Fuck with these, you'll be looking for cuts to bleed
I be spilling milk ridiculous indeed
Trying to fuck with the Chizzo I stay raw to the core
I rock stages low grounds to high floors
I break niggas down see y'all be forewarned
You mourn the day when Chiznock wasn't in it
Now don't get it twisted Chocs get you lifted
Girls for weeks so I roll wit pure Shieks
You're fucking with the wrong man and the wrong plan
Choclair's the name and T Dot be the land
Motherfuckers

Hook:
(I can't get enough)
Solitair: We remain fresh for you nigga!
(I can't get enough)
Choclair: Circle Empire drops hits and stays fresh for days
(I can't get enough)
Solitair: We remain fresh for you nigga!
(I can't get enough)
Choclair: The Suave Dog drops hits and stays fresh for days

Now the things that I do, well keep your eyes on me
These hating people always trying to put some things on me
But I do what I do I never sway to be no fades
I be doing rhymes for love but also 'cause it pays
Now ladies on these tips 'cause they think I got a whip
Never messing with no tricks unless she's standing on her....eyyhk!
Every move is calculated "Chocs you be high?"
Yo I'm high 'cause my whole lyricals make me fly
And people try to chastize but only capsize
And these ladies with these nice thighs got me hypnotized
Yo Chizzy! From NY to Shanghai
To T Dot the O making moves like Rambo
Now people here me coming so they flick they flambeaus
Steel toe is I long time ??? I roll wit my
Flow comes heavily now listen
I keep it tight like virgins on they first night
With some brothers who be stressing no question
I turn your bitch ass to hush puppies
?Sicker suade? flat ace yo they think that I'm obscene
'Cause I shine like lips with vaseline
Everybody what

Hook

Now I be doing this every day, every year
Now people call me Chocs but the name is Choclair
But no drama though I cruise right through the paranormal
And give love like dominoes
The Chizz-o rock from out the hilltop
Yo I'm out for Gusto like Madlocks
Understand the fact when I rap it's all about the illy flows
I be with my illy Circle understand it
I cruise now like as if I owned planet
The Chocs ran it and now you standing ass naked
Trying to pull it off like you getting these
Drive Infinites but you standing with your pants at your knees
You mad at me and pushing threats onto me
Granted niggas watch my back so people mind what you speak
You try to preach, but yo the writing's on the wall
Still you try to bring me down but I'm higher than y'all
Kinda flyer than y'all, but you niggas steady warring
At my shit but you know every word, every line, every comma
Every time I do a pause, every time I take a breath (Huuuuh!)
Steady on the gear understand the flow
"What you saying dog?" Individual, lyrical
Is I, reflect like the lights off a 929 with deep dishes
Chromed on ass ?suaving? the cap misses
Understand me - the C to the H to the Z-N-O the C-K be the way
The Choclair slays MCs is everyday
Don't fuck with the man...'sup now?
What
