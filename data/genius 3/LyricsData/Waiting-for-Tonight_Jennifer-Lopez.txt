[Verse 1]
Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness
The tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I have dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

[Verse 2]
Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now, leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I have dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I have dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

[Verse 3]
Gone are the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on

[Chorus]
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I have dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Waiting for tonight
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight
I have dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
