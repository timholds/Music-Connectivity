[Intro:]
Chea, yeah I speak from my heart, from the depths of my soul
To the youngest of young, to the oldest of old
Take care of mama, it's like taking care of flock man
All stars with the (?) so I say take care of mama

[Verse 1:]
I pray everyday, I ain't saved dawg
I ain't slipping days, you can see it my face dawg
I'm about to break God, cause I'm gettin' older
And I don't know if I can bear the weight that's on my shoulders
I'm at the tunnel's end, and I don't see the light
I ain't givin' up, but I ain't got the strength to fight
I get sick somedays, I ain't fit somedays
The industry so sheisty, I just wanna quit somedays
I thought about the block, she start calling back
But I promised myself that I was gonna be through with that
Hey, I believe in karma, you reap what you sow
Scared of the consequences of hurting people just for dough
I know some disagree, but it's bigger than we
It's way bigger than you, it's so bigger than me
I strive to achieve, but that's another story
Lord I'm doing my best, but I fall short of your glory

[Hook:]
If I'm on the road and traveling and lose my way
Oh Lord, won't you take care of mama?
And in the midst of all the confusion, Lord I pray
Oh Lord, won't you take care of mama?
And if I'm cold in the winter and I'm going to November
Oh Lord, won't you take care of mama?
(Mama all is good)

[Verse 2:]
Yea, I worry a alot, it's bad for my health
How can I trust in you when I barely trust in myself?
I'm playing this game, that has no sure winners
Just rich and poor, plus saints and sinners
I try to take precaution on this road I'm walkin'
My life in trouble baby, I been prayin' more often
Lord take care of mama in case I don't return
I know the look on her face, a look of pure concern
Hey, I be lyin' if I said I wasn't scared of dyin'
But Hell is worse, having wings and never, ever, flyin'
Beat yourself up because you never was the one for tryin'
I see the good man, I'm here for soul inspirin'
They feel me off in these streets, but it's bigger than we
It's way bigger than you, it's so bigger than me
I strive to succeed, but that's another story
Lord I'm dong my best, but I fall short of your glory

[Hook:]
