[Mo B. Dick]
Sometimes I don't know why
I just let you take control of my life
I'm tired of the lies you keep telling me
I was blinded by love but now I see

[Dolliolie/(Mo B. Dick)]
And I'm fed up (I'm fed up)

That's been going on (That's been going on)
I'm fed up (I'm fed up)
What's goin on (What's goin on)
I'm tired of this shhhh (I'm tired of this shhh)
That's been going on (That's been going on)
