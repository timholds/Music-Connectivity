[Verse 1: Krews]
What the fuck you actin like, you ain't actin right
I got passion homie, haters steady hatin make it happen homie
Kinda surprised he ain't blastin on me
Buncha mothafuckas out here passin on me
But im feelin fly like a mothafuckin G
Got real niggas out here fuckin with me
Got real bitches out here fuckin OD
Suckin on D, nothin on me
Doing hip hop and blowin hip hop cash
Got OG kush in the ziplock bag
And im tryna live life my way
Yeah, high speed ass highway
Freeway, threeway, thawed out loud
And i murder the d-day
Live fly die grounded
Astounded, still im nobody important
Im scorching though
Scorching ho
Layin in gold bottles
Hella weed, nigga I ain't no role model

[Hook:]
Man I try to tell them niggas I ain't who they tryna to be
Man I try to tell them bitches I ain't who they tryna to see
Hit the coupe, Got a chopper on the right hand side of me
Got a 40 in the other, tell your friends I ain't no role model
Tell your friends I ain't no role model
Tell your friends I ain't no role model
Boy im just a young mothafucka doin me
Yeah I gotta keep it G, Yeah I gotta keep a beat til im gone

[Verse 2: Olu]
Talk tough, I gooze shots
Bad bitches suck tube socks
My favorite kind of role model
She suck me off, like a juice box
I fed that hoe my soul food
Bitch i think Im Lou Rawls
Got holograms of that cali bud
No I ain't no 2Pac
Im higher than a mothafucka
Chillin on the moon
Poppin mollies, havin sex, drugs and rock n roll
No i ain't no role model, im too young to be that dude
Im an all-american asshole, your bitch be my vaccuum
Everytime im back in my home town
I stunt hard and then block hoes
Now why them bitches wanna fuck with me
When they wasn't all in that highschool
Cuz these days im that dude, okay cool
I'll fuck with you
Pussy's only pussy, swear it doesnt mean that much to me
I get it when i can
Hardly ever chase it
Sippin slow on Jacky Dan cuz I hardly ever chase it
My swag is straight eclectic
I can't fuck with nothin basic
Couldn't jack it if you tried mothafucka you should face it

[Hook:]
Man I try to tell them niggas I ain't who they tryna to be
Man I try to tell them bitches I ain't who they tryna to see
Hit the coupe, Got a chopper on the right hand side of me
Got a 40 in the other, tell your friends I ain't no role model
Tell your friends I ain't no role model
Tell your friends I ain't no role model
Boy im just a young mothafucka doin me
Yeah I gotta keep it G, Yeah I gotta keep a beat til im gone
