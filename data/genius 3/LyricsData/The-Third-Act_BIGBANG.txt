In the third act

Where the good guy

Is beat to the ground

She rose from her chair

With a stiff smile

In a tight dress

We’ve seen her before

She went for the door

Why do all her men

Make old scars seem fresh again

In the third act

Where the good guy

Is nowhere around

But a stranger

With the same lips

Her fingers once felt

Thought she could melt

Why do all her men

Make old scars seem fresh again

In the third act

Where the good girl

Is beat to the ground

With a stiff smile

In a tight dress

We’ve seen her before

She went for the door

In the third act

Where the good guy

Is beat to the ground

Hey kitty kitty cat

Climbing a tall tree

Scared to come down

Stay clear high wires

Hey midnight flyer

You can’t go around

So close to the ground
