Dub your shit baby

Chorus (2x):
Everybody put/throw your lighters up
Tell me, y'all finna fight or what?
Everybody get your shit started
This is *y'all* motherfuckin party!

[Boots]
Every death is an abrupt one
Every cop is a corrupt one
Without no cash up in the trust fund
Every cat wit a gat wanna bust one
Every guest want a plus-one
Every tenement's a penitent
Every tried man is innocent
Time served should be the cent spent
Everybody wanna hear the lick
Every one a y'all is getting pimped
Every time I spit I'm feelin ripped
Every cancer is a homicide
Every boss better run and hide
Every human is some kin to Black
Every Visa got a PIN to crack
Every verse is from the cardiac
Every search is involuntary
Every inmate want commissary
Every bank note is promissory
Every broke motherfucker finna form a gang
And when we come we takin everything

Chorus (2x):

[Boots]
Every mack want a Cadillac
Every mark want they scrilla back
Every narc want a hit of crack
In the park or a Pontiac
Every little cent is to the rent
Every roach is a resident
Every truth ain't evident
Every slave story, present tense
Every uprise a consequence
Every time it be something sweet
Every banker is a fuckin thief
Everybody betta holla wit me
Every fiend need a dolla fifty
Every crime that I do is petty
Every criminal is rich already
Every lender got a complex
Every single is a bomb threat
Every sellout, may ya hate my verse
Everybody, they gon' get it first
Every broke motherfucker finna form a gang
And when we come we taking everything
