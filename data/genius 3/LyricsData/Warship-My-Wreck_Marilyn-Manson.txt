[Verse]
You're a paper doll
I'll fold you how I want
You're not my noose
I tied this knot
If this won't be
Our fingers locked together
Then this is total war
Method not objective

[Pre-Chorus] x4
You can't ever say that I'm breaking the rules
If I can't glue them back together

[Chorus] x3
Scars on my fingers, bruises, my neck
Crashin' my trains, warship my wreck

[Bridge] x2
Cut the hands off
Kamikaze into your soul

[Chorus] x2

Worship my wreck

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus] x5
