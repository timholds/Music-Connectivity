[Hook]
When I touch a mil', I'ma be the same dude
Split the money with my gang too
And we be swervin' in that Audi coupe
Eatin' foreign exchange foods

[Post-Hook]
Couple fly ass niggas on the 495
Takin' trips with my gang, couple blunts to get us high
I got a white bitch who live way out on L.I
Her father stealing Taxes so you know she gotta ride

[Verse 1]
But I ain't worried 'bout your income
See, I just wanna rub your ass and get a little drunk
These bitches on me so I feel like Channing Tatum
And I'ma be a fuckin' savage 'til my day come

[Hook]
See, when I touch a mil', I'ma be the same dude
Split the money with my gang too
See, we be swervin' in that Audi coupe
Eatin' foreign exchange food

[Verse 2]
You know me, I be worried 'bout my bread, fuck a hoe
She been here for an hour, so you know she gotta go
I'm that 6'2" nigga that your bitch probably know
And my name rings bells so I gotta stay low
Yeah, I gotta stay low
I be coolin' in the whip with your ho
She know me, VIP GANG, we gon' blow

[Hook]
See, when I touch a mil', I'ma be the same dude
I split the money with my gang too
And we be swervin' in that Audi coupe
Eatin' foreign exchange food

[Verse 3]
Skurt skurt!

G star with the Bape, oh my
A nigga 21 now, time flies
How you ballin' but you can't throw 5?
Same dude
Yeah, I'm the same dude
Chillin' with the same crew
When I touch a mil', I'ma be the same dude
