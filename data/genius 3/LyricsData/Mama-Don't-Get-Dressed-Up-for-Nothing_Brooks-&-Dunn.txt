[Verse]
She said hey cowboy get off of that couch
Yeah, the party's on and we're going out
I got my low cut dress and my knee high-boots
I'm like money to burn and nothing to lose
You're the man of the house you better think of something
Because Mama don't get dressed up for nothing
She said I been cooped up in this house all week
It's time to pick it up and move it out to party street
She said saddle up horse it's your lucky day
And I'm a she cat tiger coming out of the cage
We can go high rolling or beer joint jumping
Mama don't get dressed up for nothing
She's hard to handle, a little high strung
I'll see her bet and I'll raise her one
I love when she gets wound up
I'm Jack of Hearts, she's my Lady Luck
We're going to find a little place where we can rip and roar
We going to cut a deep groove in that hardwood floor
Set up the shooters and break out the green
Throw a whole row of quarters in the boogie machine
We going to turn up the heat and keep the jukebox humping
Because mama don't get dressed up for nothing
Go high rolling or beer joint jumping
Mama don't get dressed up for nothing
She said babe you better think of something
Because mama don't get dressed up for nothing
