[Chorus]
It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you
I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with
Now baby you should know that it's not that serious

[Verse 1]
How could you tell me that you love me
When I know you were just trying to play me
But you are the fool
Because I know how to switch the game up on you
And in the end I know who will lose
I played this game before
And I can't play no more
What do you take me for
It is not what you thought
So don't play games with me
Because I play to teach
And if you want to cheat
It won't be on me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It should concern you that I'm always one step ahead of you
So that should let you know that what you do
I have done before, it is nothing new
So run those games on someone who can't be fooled
I can almost see lies coming through your teeth
In every word you speak you make it clear to me
That you are playing wrong and your game isn't strong
I have been in this too long, so just be moving on

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Tu me haces reir todas las veces que
Tu creias que yo no sabia que
Tu estabas haciendo
Tu sabes que yo ha sido todo eso antes
Al final tu eres el perdia
No jueges conmigo[?]
Don't play games with my heart
I will let you go before you start

[Chorus] [x2]
