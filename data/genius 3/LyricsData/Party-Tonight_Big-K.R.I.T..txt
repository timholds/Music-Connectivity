[Hook: Big KRIT]
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow don't mean that we ball
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow they might kill us all
So we drink, and we smoke
Cause our problems won't let us go
We rolled around, head in the clouds
Living life the best that we know
Singing Lord let us party tonight

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
I just wanna see my friends in big body Benzes
Pay they bills and feed they kids
On occasion, we hit the club or go vacation
In places we never seen, that'd be amazing
We all dreamers not petty schemers, although you think
Know you racist, know you hate me
You too anxious to up and shoot me
That shit so stupid, look how they do me
This my last night, come and scoop me, singing

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow don't mean that we ball
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow they might kill us all
So we drink, and we smoke
Cause our problems won't let us go
We rolled around, head in the clouds
Living life the best that we know
Singing Lord let us party tonight

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
I just wanna celebrate in the back we made it
To the 'burbs
From the pavement
Ain't no placements for congragations
When you cool, but you you blazin'
Out on the corner
Not marijuana
Glock with no safety
Catching cases
Bullet strays
Killed a kid the other day
Why you shooting? That shit so stupid
Can't own the block or the stoop
And you gain the world just to lose it
I feel your struggle
Pops a hustler, ain't never hug ya
Mama say it like you daddy
She couldn't love ya
Its fucked up
When you moving but steady losing
Before you lose it put down tool
I'ma scoop you, singing

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow don't mean that we ball
Lord let us party tonight
Cause tomorrow they might kill us all
So we drink, and we smoke
Cause our problems won't let us go
We rolled around, head in the clouds
Living life the best that we know
Singing Lord let us party tonight

[Outro: Big Krit] x2
Its our party and we fly if we want to
Higher than the pain that we go through
Celebrate the life that we might lose
If I don't see you again
