[Verse 1]
Anytime you're feeling lonely
Anytime you're feeling blue
Anytime you feel down-hearted
That will prove your love for me is true

[Chorus 1]
Anytime you're thinking about me
That's the time I'll be thinking of you

[Chorus 2]
So anytime you say you want me back again
That's the time I'll come on home to you

[Verse 2]
Anytime you feel down-hearted
That will prove your love for me is true

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
That's the time I'll come on home to you
