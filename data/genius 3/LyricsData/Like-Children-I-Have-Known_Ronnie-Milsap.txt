They're dividing up their playthings
This is yours, this is mine
They're dividing up the bedroom
With an imaginary line

One is running back to mother
One just wants to be alone
They will cry and pout and walk out
Just like children I have known
Just like children I have known

They're not wiser, they're just grown
It's not a chocolate ice cream cone
It's not a doll-house, it's a home
Just like children I have known

Almost down to sticks and stones
They'll be lost out on their own
Just like children I have known
Just like children I have known

And they're gonna cry their eyes out
Once they find out what they've done
Cause their hearts aren't made of candy
That they eat what the other wants

It could be a happy ending
They don't have to live alone
They could kiss and hug and make up
Just like children I have known
Just like children I have known

They're not wiser, they're just grown
It's not a chocolate ice cream cone
It's not a doll-house, it's a home
Just like children I have known...
