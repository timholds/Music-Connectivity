So will you be a boy?
Or will you be the king?
Will you break my heart?
I'll be the sweetest thing
I'm not just another (just another girl - girl, girl, girl)

Tell you what I want
All I want is love
Even if it seems like it's too much
I'm not asking for the world
I'm not just another girl

Every time we hook up, boy, you're always in a rush
You say keep it on the hush, but I'm not just a play thing
That you can play games with, oh baby, no

And every time you see me, boy, you better recognize
Don't undress me with your eyes, 'cause I won't be disrespected
I'm not what you expected, or what you've had before

See, I'm not just another girl
Boy, I've got myself in line, so don't go wasting my time (wasting my time)
But if you take good care of me
Baby, I will make you see that I'll be all that you need (all that you need, oh)

Tell you what I want
All I want is love
Even if it seems like it's too much
I'm not asking for the world
I'm not just another girl

You wanna be my man (my man)
Boy, you better get with the program
I don't mean to be demanding, but don't you take my lovin' for granted
'Cause every time I wanna talk, well, you just turn around
I'm not tryin' to bring you down
But I need some attention, so I can feel special
'Cause, baby, I'm the one

'Cause I'm not just another girl
Boy, I've got myself in line, so don't go wasting my time (wasting my time)
But if you take good care of me
Baby, I will make you see that I'll be all that you need (all that you need, oh)

Tell you what I want
All I want is love
Even if it seems like it's too much
I'm not asking for the world
I'm not just another girl

It's not too much, baby, 'cause I'm the one
Don't need the world, 'cause I'm not just a girl
Just another girl

'Cause every time we hook up, boy, you're always in a rush
You say keep it on the hush, but I'm not just a play thing
That you can play games with, oh baby, no

And every time you see me, boy, you better recognize
Don't undress me with your eyes, 'cause I won't be disrespected
Disrespected... oh...

Tell you what I want
All I want is love
Even if it seems like it's too much
I'm not asking for the world
I'm not just another girl

It's not too much, baby, 'cause I'm the one (it's not too much, baby)
Don't need the world, 'cause I'm not just a girl

It's not too much, baby, 'cause I'm the one
(will you be a boy?...all I want is love... I'm not in it for the world)
Don't need the world, 'cause I'm not just a girl
