[Intro]
Metro Boomin want some more nigga

[Hook]
Back hitting licks, back on that dirty (straight up!)
Cuzzo back on the block, he back servin' birdies (bando)
Plug hit my switch, damn he woke me up early (oh no)
If that bitch smell like swiss, oh no no no, don't serve her (straight up)
Back hitting licks, back on that dirty (La Flame)
Cuzzo back on the block, he back servin' birdies (straight up)
Plug hit my switch, damn he woke me up early (oh no)
If that bitch smell like swiss, oh no no no, don't serve her

[Verse]
Black out nigga, deeper than a frat house nigga
Doper than the crack house nigga
20/20 Lambo, new edition
Gotta hit two gears just to back out, nigga (La Flame)
Been a hell of a night but hell of a dykes cost a hell of a price
With a devil in a new dress on the 35th floor, nigga
God damn that's a hell of a sight!
Damn right that is, damn right she drowned my kids
Damn right don't doubt, damn right
Damn right I hit, anything I said I did
Damn right, only roll that gas don't pass that mid
Just treat a pint like a handle
When I'm with your girl, I hit your girl in the bando
Know I go commando
Know I need my cheese, know my cheese, know the nachos
Fall back, back, back, when you see me
Fall back when you see me tweakin'
Throw that ass back, back, back, back, know a nigga might throw that ticket
Feds hit my block, it got hot
But I'm back up in this bitch and I can't stop

[Hook]
Back hitting licks, back on that dirty
Cuzzo back on the block, he back servin' birdies
Plug hit my switch, damn he woke me up early
If that bitch smell like swiss, oh no no no, don't serve her
Back hitting licks, back on that dirty
Cuzzo back on the block, he back servin' birdies
Plug hit my switch, damn he woke me up early
If that bitch smell like swiss, oh no no no, don't serve her
