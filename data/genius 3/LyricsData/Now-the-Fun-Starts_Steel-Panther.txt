[Verse 1]
Take a little toke, drink a little wine
Shoot a little smack, snort a little line
Get a blowjob from the bosses wife
You only live once, baby, live your life, yeah. (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
Two in the pink, one in the brown
Steel Panther's coming all up in your town
Make one last trip to the corner store
Get tequila and some lube for your backdoor, yeah. (Yeah)

You're gonna need it

[Chorus]
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!

[Verse 3]
Party with Caitlyn or party with Bruce
In the front door or in the caboose
Is it a chick or is it a dude?
Doesn't really matter if she looks good nude, yeah. (Yeah)

[Bridge 1]
Yeah, we get so fucking high
The girls are so fucking hot
We never question why
Only why I'm fucking not

[Chorus]
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!

[Guitar Solo]

Ooooh baby!

[Bridge 2]
Yeah, anything goes tonight
So let's get high tonight
Tell me how could this be wrong
When it feels so right?

[Chorus]
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!
Now the fun starts!
