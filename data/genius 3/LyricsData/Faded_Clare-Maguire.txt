[Verse 1]
I've been chasing paradise
I've been chasing paradise
Night time leaves me paralyzed
Night time leaves me paralyzed

[Pre-Chorus]
Twisted thinking feels so pretty
Heartbreak falls on the violent city
I've been chasing paradise

[Chorus]
I'm faded, searching for my
I'm faded, searching for my

[Verse 2]
I've got rivers in my eyes
I've got rivers in my eyes
Night time leaves me paralyzed
Night time leaves me paralyzed

[Pre-Chorus]
These white lights are cut like diamonds
Flickering divine
I've got rivers in my eyes

[Chorus]
I'm faded, searching for my
I'm faded, searching for my

[Bridge]
I'm not asking for a long affair
I'm not saying that I care
I'm not asking  for a long affair
I'm not saying that I care

[Chorus]
I'm faded, searching for my
I'm faded, searching for my

[Outro]
Faded love, faded love
Faded love, faded love
Faded love, faded love
Faded love
