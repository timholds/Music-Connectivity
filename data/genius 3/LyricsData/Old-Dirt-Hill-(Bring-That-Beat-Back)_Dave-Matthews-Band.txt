Bring that beat back to me again
Bring that beat back to me again
Take me back. Can't catch me

Ride my bike down the old dirt hill
First time without my training wheels
First time I kissed you I lost my legs
Bring that beat back to me again

Scream and shoutin out of innocence
Days when all we did would never end

Bring that beat back to me again
Bring that beat back to me again
Take me back. Can't catch me

Smokin under the railroad bridge
I used to ride my bike down that old dirt hill
First time I kissed you I lost my legs
Bring that beat back to me again

Scream and shoutin out of innocence
Days when all we did would never end

Screamin down that old dirt hill
Bring that beat back to me again

Don't you know
Days I remember
Just a kiss
That's what I miss
Just a kiss
That's what I miss
Take Me back
Take Me back to that beat again

Smokin under the railroad bridge
Bring that beat back to me again
Bring that beat back to me again
Bring that beat back to me again
First time I among good friends
Bring that beat back to me again....
