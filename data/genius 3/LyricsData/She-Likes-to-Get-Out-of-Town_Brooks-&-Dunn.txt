[Verse 1]
Looking at her phone, desk tapping her feet
Kinda girl your Mamma likes to meet
A Sunday school dress cutting up tight
When the weekend comes, she's like a red tail-light

[Chorus]
She likes to get out of town
Yeah, she likes to get out of town
She's got a little red ragtop she just bought
Just forty-five minutes from her two days off...
She's watching the clock just a-counting it down
That girl likes to get out of town, mm

[Verse 2]
She's got a little glove box with everything she needs
Got some red lipstick an' some multi-colour beads
Got some party girlfriends like to keep it unwound
That girl likes to get out of town

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, yeah, my, my
Big front's closed, says the city limits sign
Yeah, yeah, do tell
Tell this little angel, don't raise a little L L L L
She's got a second cousin that keeps her on the 'phone
Got an ex-boyfriend that won't leave her alone
Oh, but it won't hurt 'em what they don't know
What goes on the road stays on the road

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Yeah, she likes to get out of town. (Yeah, yeah.)
Going crank it on, crank it
(Ooh yeah now.)
