I like my friends when they're heartbroken
And in need of company
But they all seem to have things figuered out
And no one ever calls me

So if you feel like it
I always feel like it
I'll bring my problems too

I'm here drinking all by myself
Making plans for the future
In the big scheme and everything
The world's got too much yang

Sometimes not so well-paid women
Come and talk to me
They all say a time will come
For my home-sick soul you see

And while their faces are lying
I'm kind of glad they're tying
Here's to battered women's rides

I'm here drinking all by myself
I'm gonna make my share of trouble
In the big scheme and everything
The world's got too much yang
