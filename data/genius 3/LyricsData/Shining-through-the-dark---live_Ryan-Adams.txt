What ever happened to the old me
What ever happened to us
Whatever it was it doesn't matter now
Those days went speeding by
And left us in the dust
The car's on empty
It rattles in the rust

Whatever this is is permanent
A red wine stain or a scar
Like one of those if you flip the negative
You knew who I was
Even before I even knew
Now just look who we are

And these wheels turn fast
These wheels turn bright
Reflecting our love. The moon goes shining
Shining through the darks of the night
Shinging through the darks of the night

You know the house that I wanna buy
I wanna buy it for you
It's in my head when my head hits the pillow
And I'm lying here, lying here next to you

Whatever this is is everything
My feet are sore and blue
And everything you know I ever did before
Was just to get me back
Get me back here with you

And these wheels turn fast
These wheels turn bright
Reflecting our love. The moon goes shining
Shining through the darks of the night
These wheeles turn fast
These wheels turn bright
Reflecting our love. The moon goes shining
Shining through the darks of the night
Shining through the darks of the night
Shining through the darks of the night
Shining through the darks of the night
