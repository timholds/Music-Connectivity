3 a.m., I'm drunk again
My head is standing underneath my feet so
Make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off

Sedatives and dizzy spells
And spilling my guts out beneath my feet
So make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, slipped into a coma once again
Where's my organ donor? lend a hand!

[Chorus]
So when you think you're all alone
No one's left to come around
Drop like flies and empathize
Cause I know that I will someday
And I know that I will suffocate
Suffocate, suffocate, suffocate

One night stands and cheap regrets
I take another drag off of my cigarette
So stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off

One last stop for a one track mind
Just give me shelter, give me give me something
Make it stop, I'm getting off
Make it stop, I'm getting off

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] x2
