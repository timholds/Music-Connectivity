[Verse 1]
Seven in the morning
When they wake you gotta be ghost
Let me tell you one thing
I'm about to overflow
Boy, you don't know my bed
Well, tonight you might find out
Open up my window
Once you're in there's no way out

[Pre-Chorus]
I am a river
And this river's slowing down
Know where you'll wind up
Cross my water 'til you drown
I feel it, baby
Tell me what so I know how
I've been up, baby

[Chorus]
So you can take me apart
Waited up all night
Take me apart
And I wait up all night
I wait up, I wait up
All night

[Verse 2]
Afraid of falling knowing that I could never live without
Try to tell you one thing
And then you just read my mind
Where you going, baby, without kissing me goodbye?
Try to fight it, baby
And now we're going back

[Pre-Chorus]
My river's slowing down
Know where you'll wind up
Cross my water 'til you drown
I feel it, baby
Tell me what so I know how
I've been up, baby

[Chorus]
You better take me apart
Take me apart
Waited up all night
Take me apart
'Cause I'm waiting
Take me apart
And I wait up all night
I wait up, I wait up
All night

[Bridge]
I'm working, I can't keep my head up
'Cause we're talking late at night
Started a song then I gave up
So, I hope this comes out right
Don't say you're in love, baby
Don't say you're in love, baby
Don't say you're in love until you learn to take me apart

[Chorus]
Waited up all night
Take me apart
And I wait up all night
I wait up, I wait up
All night

[Outro]
I wait up, I wait up
I wait up, I wait up
Take me apart
I wait up all night
I wait up, I wait up
Take me apart
I wait up, I wait up all night
