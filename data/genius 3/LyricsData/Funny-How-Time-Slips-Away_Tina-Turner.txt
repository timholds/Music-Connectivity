[Verse 1]
Well hello there
My, it's been a long long time
How am I doing
Oh well I guess I'm doing fine
It's been so long since I've seen you

[Chorus]
It seems like yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

[Verse 2]
How's your new love
I guess she's doing fine
I heard you told her
That you would love her till the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
That you told me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got to go now
But I guess I'll see you somewhere around
I don't know when though, oh
Because I never know when I'll be back in town
Please remember what I told you
Well I just want to say

[Bridge]
That it's so funny
How time slips away[x2]

[Outro][x4]
Ain't it funny
How time slips away
