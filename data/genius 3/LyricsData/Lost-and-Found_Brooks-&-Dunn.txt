[Verse 1]
I lost her trail on a Friday night
She was gone before I got home
She'd been getting restless
In that big house all alone
I've been up and down these city streets
For three nights in a row
And lord it's hard to find that girl
When she gets the urge to go

[Chorus]
It's kinda like a lost and found
In a border town
Asking bout a diamond ring
They just look at you
Like you've lost your mind
Say they haven't seen a thing
But I know she's been here lately
I can still smell her perfume
And she gets crazy on a full moon

[Verse 2]
And I know she'll be coming back
Her car is waiting right outside
But, I don't want to think about
Who's taking her for a ride
And her unpredictability
Is what I love about her best
Lord I've got to find her quick
Before she does something I regret

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
She's out there somewhere
Burning up the night
Somehow I've got to run her down
I'm running out of time

[Chorus][x2]
