You can tell her
That you love her
A hundred different ways
But it won't mean as much
As just the right touch
At just the right time of day

You've got to show her a little each day
Really show her, You mean what you say
It's not enough just to tell her you love her
If you want her to know you've got to let it show

When her laughter turns to tears
For reasons she can't explain
Remember this that just one kiss
Was all your love needs to say

Go on and show her a little each day
Really show her, You mean what you say
It's not enough just to tell her you love her
If you want her to know you've got to let it show

So, if you can't live without her
You better learn to let her know how you feel
Just remember that you hold the power
To tell her all that words can't reveal

You've got to show her a little each day
Really show her, You mean what you say
It's not enough just to tell her you love her
If you want her to know you've got to let it show...
