[Interlude: Egypt]
Compton is where I'm from
Is where I'm from, where is I'm from

Part II

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah
Young Egypt
Look, look

[Verse]
I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest and latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice and writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist died countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and Bimmers and blue leather
Forecastin' my future, this is the future
The mastermind until my next album, more power to you
{Gunshot}

Part III

[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on

[Interlude: Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold]
This is a fifteen minute song
We're just jammin' out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin' out (shhh)
Hundred thousand (aw yeah, aw shit)
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody

[Verse 1: Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold]
Now I don't let you down, and for
You see, you see, you see, you see (Right)
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you
They say the government ain't the truth, truth, truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth (What?)

[Verse 2: Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold]
But head is the answer
Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now
Head is the answer (Yeah)
Head is the futu—it's the future, that nigga said
Don't second guess yourself (Crazy, holy shit)
Come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on—my background singer—come on, come on (Right, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Say, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar & Taz Arnold]
I said, girl you make me wanna, uh
Great, the ho screaming now
Uh, I said baby you make
You make me wanna just, ah!
Baby you got me speechless right now
{Laughs} (You gotta take it there)
I gotta take it there, I ain't even playin' no more
Uh, said you just make me wanna Drake you down
To the ground, to the ground
Like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
You just make me wanna Drake you down
Down, around like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
And baby if your mama's around, if your mama's around
If your mama's around, if your mama's around
Tell her, tell her
No discrimination, she young nigga chasin'
And she can get the dick too!

[Outro: Kendrick Lamar]
I said come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Yeah, nigga
You gotta do it, man
We gonna lay that shit
We gonna lay that shit man, and watch what it's gon' do
