[Chorus]
I know you must hold secrets
Such a long way from home
You're a lost letter, needs delivery
Someday you'll be where you should go
Someday you won't be so alone
Someday you'll be where you should go
Someday you won't be so alone

[Verse 1]
You coulda been an acrobat
You coulda used what you know
You coulda been what you wanted
You fall for the rhymes like snow
Press me, I'll tell you I'm looking
Looking for some sign of life
Press me, I'll tell you I'm looking

[Bridge]
C'mon, gimme some spirit
Don't take too much to get me excited
Whisper, I'll listen to hear it
Just show me some sign of life

[Chorus]
I know you must hold secrets
Such a long way from home
You're a lost letter, needs delivery
Someday you'll be where you should go
Someday you won't be so alone
Someday you'll be where you should go
Someday you won't be so alone
Someday you'll be where you should go

[Verse 2]
Candyman drives a fast car
He can be there anytime
His fuel is anticipation
It's good to feel wanted sometimes
All these expectations
Waiting for my cells to divide
Wait, is that too maudlin?
I'm just lookin' for some sign of life

[Chorus]
I know you must hold secrets
Such a long way from home
You're a lost letter, needs delivery
Someday you'll be where you should go
Someday you won't be so alone
Someday you'll be where you should go

[Outro]
Come on, show me some spirit
Don't take too much to get me excited
Whisper, I'll listen to hear it
Just show me some sign of life
