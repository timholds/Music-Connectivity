[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Krizzle he a new breed
Life is like a movie
All the new comers like who he? who me?
Just a nigga straight up out the gutta
With the skill that make a new yorker wanna be southern
Streets lights tell the stories of the real niggas
Pardon me if half of the time I never feel niggas
Like honestly how the fuck you get a deal nigga?
I guess once I get on I'm gonna have to kill niggas
Lord I was trying not to push it to the ledge
The grind ain't sturdy and we hanging on the edge
Mississippi got next
You heard what I said?
And I'll still out rap some of the best when I'm dead
Check my cred killer is a vet
I'm talking about bars I ain't talking about pets
When I get green like gumby I stretch
A pair of J's out the case
I'm that fresh, yes
Give me any beat
And I'll kill it like it's living
I only do me it's fuck how they feeling
That green that I'm toting got me higher than the ceiling
The whip color sunny d nigga I'm orange peeling
Street life chilling niggas can't touch me
Car without an engine, bitch you can't budge me
Heard the lames hate me and they baby mommas love me
If they didn't handcuff em at my show
They'd probably fuck me
I'm a little crazy
I'm a little off though
Put you on display in the day like a car show
Toss you in the trunk
And drive away with the cargo
All I see is snow bunnies
Call me Donnie Darko
Grill look mean on the whip
It's a gargoyle
This the shit niggas in the hood
Sell hard for
A fine crib and a lambo marcielago
A1 credit and the next top model
But you know niggas
Think they guns can stop 4 niggas
Claim they hard as hell
But really ho niggas
Slow niggas never get paid
Gold diggers get played
And lame niggas never get laid
Unless they throwing fetti
At a chick they call me daddy
She bring me all the money
Because she know that make me happy
Go out and break her back
Just to keep a nigga flashing
And see me on top
She thought it was a classic
I'm a nervous wreck
On the mic
I keep spazzing
Married to my money
And she having contractions
Gave birth to money
With no lamaze classes
My toddler dig the new line
Of rubberband fashion
