[Verse 1: Quavo]
Ice cold, 'frigerator froze
Ice cold, 'frigerator froze
Ice cold, 'frigerator froze
Bankrolls, cheese, nachos
Superbowl, Quavo scooped and scored
She gets so hot, she gets too hot
You want a pro

Oh, I guess... (brr)
Oh, oh, I guess... (brr)
Ride around and flex (brr)
Disrespect (brr)
Yuh, link with me (brr)
Light my neck and link with me (brr)
Yuh, lean and weed (brr)
Can't control the lean and weed (brr)
So lowkey with it
So highkey with it
Once I get that cake I just can't let it go
