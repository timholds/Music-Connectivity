[Faith]
Living my life without you
Something I don't wanna do
So please don't walk away
And leave me all alone
Baby, stay for just a while

1 - Why can't you stay with me
For just a while
'cause if you leave
You'll take a piece of me
Why can't you stay
With me for just a while
Boy, you know you have the key to my heart

[112]
Oh baby, girl I don't want you to go
You are my heart and soul
The reason that I live
The one that I adore
And I can't stand the thought
Of being by myself
But I can't see myself
Loving no, nobody else

Repeat 1

[112]
And when ever you need me girl
I'll be right by your side
I'll always love you
Who can love you
Why won't you stay with me awhile

Ad lib

Repeat 1 until fade
