You will find him
Running out the pens
It's an escape for him
But he'll come back around
For sure

I can see how hard it is for you
But you know in your heart
He'll be there for you
When you need him the most

You can find her
Sitting next to you
But will stress her bad knees
Looking for something else to do
You have your reservations
But in your heart you know
She has and always will be there
By your side
And will gladly let you know that

[Chorus]
She loves you so [x 4]

He won't be too long
She won't be too long
He won't be too long
She won't be too long
She won't be too long

I love you both [x 4]
