[Verse 1]
Guess I should've shut my mouth
But I had to get it out
So much for being headstrong
Now I'm going half way out my mind
I know I was out of line
No scratch that, I was dead wrong

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Know I shoulda let it go but I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone but, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back if I knew all I'd be left with
Is these shoulda, coulda, wouldas 'cause you're gone

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here trippin' cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning, it's gettin' out of control
I'm backin' down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone

[Verse 2]
Heaven knows if you were here
I'd be all up in your ear
Least you could do is answer your phone
Cause I realized my mistake
Baby, I'll do what it takes
If I can just get you one and one

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Shoulda let it go but I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone but, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back if I knew all I'd be left with
Is these shoulda, coulda, wouldas 'cause you're gone

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here trippin' cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning, it's gettin' out of control
I'm backin' down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone

[Bridge]
I know I pushed you out
Running off at the mouth
Sayin' all the wrong things
Calling you out your name
I was unpredictable, I was so emotional
But I swear I'm gonna do better
Can we get this back together again?

[Chorus]
Now I'm out here trippin' cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning, it's gettin' out of control
I'm backin' down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Now I'm out here trippin' cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning, it's gettin' out of control
I'm backin' down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone
Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone

[Outro]
So wrong, hear me, come back, it seems so long
