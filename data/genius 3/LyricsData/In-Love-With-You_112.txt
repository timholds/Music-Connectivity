Every day I think about
All the love you've given me
All the ways you show your love and
Girl it drives me crazy
Every day our love grows stronger
Everytime I see you
Thinking about this love you give me
Girl I can't get over you

1- Just how I feel for you
Tell me your love will always be here for me
I need your love don't ever take it away
Tell me with me is where you'll always stay

2- You are so special to me
I need you here with me
Someone to love me always
I'm in love with you

You are so special to me
Why don't you stay with me
So we can be together
I'm in love with you

Never was a love before me
No one else compares to you
No one does the things you do
To make me feel the way I do
Every time I see your pretty face
It makes me love you more
All this time I looked for love
And now it is knocking at my door

Repeat 1

Repeat 2

You mean the world to me
And you're more special
Than you think
Baby you must believe
That I love you so

Repeat 2 until fade
