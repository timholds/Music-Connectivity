Hey, I wanna see you work it, baby
I want you to be my lady
I love the way you move your body
Ooh, you drive me crazy

I'm a do it real good if you know how I felt
We could take it downstairs, like below the belt
Whatever you want, I got it, I'm hot baby ya want it
Love solid for hours, not even Austin Powers could top it
I'll groove better than you, slew better than me
Cruise over, use the penny and prove that I'm ready
Prefer it with many but really I don't care
'Coz this chick so bling it's gettin' frosty in here

Me and the boys, we'll be blazin' it up
So baby girl, take a ride in the back of the truck
If you wanna get down lemme know who you are

Girl, I love the way you work it
And if you let me, I'm gonna flip reverse it
(C'mon baby, work it for me, oh)

Girl, I love the way you work it
And if you let me, I'm gonna flip reverse it

(Gonna flip reverse it, baby)
I'm the kind of boy that like a lot of heat undercovers
Sittin' on some cheddar, need to work you, girl
But I'm the type, more like to pick up the mic
And bless this crowd with my flows, while you stare and grind
And I will bring my click, 'coz that's how we roll
And I'll take these chicks and I'll take them home
I'm makin' sure none of us leave this place alone
I gotta get a honey here and get her alone, come on

Me and the boys, we'll be blazin' it up
So baby girl, now take a ride in the back of the truck
If you wanna get down lemme know who you are

Girl, I love the way you work it
And if you let me, I'm gonna flip reverse it
(C'mon baby, work it for me, oh)

Girl, I love the way you work it
And if you let me, I'm gonna flip reverse it

(Gonna flip reverse it, baby)
This girl don't know that she'll be dealin' with melo
I see you grindin' in the club, cheek's soft like a pillow
Will make you hotter than an oven if ya gimme a second
'Coz I'm consistent, when it comes to pleasing girls I'm a blessing

Yo, flip it, rip it, lick it, girls strip it, yo, can you kick it
The mic is the ticket, goes to sip it
Freeky deeky shit, flick it, lick it good
And put it in the place is where you should and cannot the hood
No one gives you the feelings the way I could

Girl, I wanna see you work it, baby
I want you to be my lady
I love the way you move your body
Ooh, you drive me crazy

Girl, I wanna see you work it, baby
I want you to be my lady
I love the way you move your body
Ooh, you drive me crazy

Girl, I love the way you work it
And if you let me, I'm gonna flip reverse it
(C'mon baby, work it for me, oh)

Girl, I love the way you work it
And if you let me, I'm gonna flip reverse it
