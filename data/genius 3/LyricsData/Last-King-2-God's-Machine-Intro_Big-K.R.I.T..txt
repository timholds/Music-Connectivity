[Intro:]
They wanna be down with the (last) King, (two!)

[Verse 1:]
I ain't for sure, give me strength just to change what I canâ€™t
And understand the difference between a nigga and the King that I am
Didn't write it but recite it like puppets on strings
Belittled as a peasant but my bloodline is of kings
Scrappin' from the game I'll be King just you watch
See KRIT ain't just a name it's an acronym
King Remembered in Time but none come after him

[Outro:]
And now for our feature presentation
