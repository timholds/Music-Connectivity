[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)

[Verse 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Violence is an energy against the enemy
Well, violence is an energy (Rah eh!)
Bringing on the fury, the choir infantry
Revolt against the honor to obey (Oh eh, oh eh)
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
Well, burning down the foreman of control (Oh eh, oh eh)
Silence is an enemy against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul (Oh eh, oh eh)

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)

[Bridge 1: Billie Joe Armstrong]
The insurgency will rise
When the blood's been sacrificed
We'll be blinded by the lies in your eyes
Say! (Oh eh, oh eh)
(Oh eh, oh eh)

[Bridge 2: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Well, violence is an energy (Oh eh, oh eh)
Well, from here to eternity (Oh eh, oh eh)
Well, violence is an energy (Oh eh, oh eh)
Well, silence is the enemy
So gimme, gimme revolution!

[Chorus: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)
Do you know the enemy?
Do you know your enemy?
Well, gotta know the enemy (Rah eh!)

[Outro: Billie Joe Armstrong]
Overthrow the effigy, the vast majority
Well, burning down the foreman of control (Oh eh, oh eh)
Silence is an enemy, against your urgency
So rally up the demons of your soul (Oh eh, oh eh)
