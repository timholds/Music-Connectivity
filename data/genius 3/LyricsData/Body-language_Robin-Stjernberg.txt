I got sold in my sight
I'm like falling in vacation, leaving all the booze behind
I'm just sipping on some good time, sticking to the clothesline

Someone get together with this
Be your own like you own it
I'mma be the first to last
Watch me like a broadcast

Come and get together with this
Do you feel it like I feel it
You know I'm what I'm 'cause
Read my body language

Yeah, talk the talk
READ MY BODY LANGUAGE
Yeah, walk the walk
READ MY BODY LANGUAGE

I'm walking on air
I don't need a single dollar
To feel like a millionaire
I'm just soaking up the sunshine
Sending up the bright times

Come and get together with this
Do you feel it like I feel it
You know what I mean 'cause

Yeah, talk the talk
READ MY BODY LANGUAGE
Yeah, walk the walk
READ MY BODY LANGUAGE
