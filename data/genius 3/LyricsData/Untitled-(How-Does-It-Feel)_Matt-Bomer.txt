[Verse 1]
Girl it's only you
Have it your way
And if you want you can decide
And if you'll have me
I can provide everything that you desire
Said if you get a feeling
Feeling that I am feeling
Won't you come closer to me baby
You've already got me right where you want me baby
I just want to be your man

[Chorus]
How does it feel
How does it feel
Said I want to know how does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel

[Verse 2]
I want to stop
Silly little games you and me play
And I am feeling right on
If you feel the same-way baby
Let me know right away
I'd love to make you wet
In between your thighs cause
I love when it comes inside you
I get so excited when I'm around you

[Chorus]
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
Said did it ever cross your mind
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
Tell me how it feels, yeah
How does it feel
Said it's been on my mind
How does it feel
How does it feel

[Outro]
Baby close the door
Listen girl I have something I want to show you
I wish you'd open up cause
I want to take the walls down with you
