[Intro: Darkchild]
Right here
It's another Darkchild collab, you know?
Something that you can lean to
Something that you can ride to
Something that you can step to, you know?
We back!

[Verse 1]
Sometimes real love can be
Not seen because you are thinking
What is right in front of you can be the one for you
Then one day you realize that
There are feelings that you can't hold back
And you are so caught up
Now that's all you think of
Crazy how

[Pre-Chorus]
All that talk of us not able to last
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they fail to understand

[Chorus]
I got you
And nobody can come to change a thing
Cause you gotta know you got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see I've got you
You got me, I got you

[Verse 2]
Things are often said to doubt what I feel for you
But words that people say won't take my love away
Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright
But why they say some things that ain't right?
I never know but please understand that baby, it ain't nothing

[Pre-Chorus]
All that talk of us not able to last
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they fail to understand

[Chorus]
I got you
And nobody can come to change a thing
Cause you gotta know you got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (You got me, baby)
I got you (I got you, baby)
And you got me (You got me, baby)

[Bridge]
Talk is all that people can do
Nevermind all the love
All that you gotta do is simply love, trust, and just stay or there's no "us"
Together we will get through whatever if we
Don't let speculations make situations up
We'll be alright

[Chorus]
I got you
And nobody can come to change a thing
Cause you gotta know you got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)
You got me (You got me, baby)
I got you
And nobody can come to change a thing
Cause you gotta know you got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see I've got you (I've got you)
You got me (Yes, you got me, baby)
I got you (Nothing come between us)
You got me (You got me)
I got you (Through whatever)
You got me (You're all that I need)
I got you (Oh, baby)
You got me (Forever, baby)
They will see I've got you (I got you)
You got me (You got me)
I got you and you got me
