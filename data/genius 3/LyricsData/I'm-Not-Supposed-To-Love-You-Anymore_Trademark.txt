We agreed that it was over
Now the lines have all been drawn
The vows we made begin to fade but now they're gone
Put your pictures in a showbox
And my goldring in the drawer
I'm not supposed to love you anymore
Now Sherry says she's jealous
Of this freedom that I found
She would be; she would be out of the town
And she says she can't imagine
What on earth I'm waiting for
I'm not supposed to love you anymore

Oh I shouldn't care and wonder where and how you are
But I can hide this hurt inside my broken heart
I'm fighting back emotions that I've never fought before
'cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore

Now I'm writing you this letter
And it's killing me tonight
That I agreed when you believed it wasn't right
And I couldn't sleep up on the bed
So I'm down here on the floor
Will I'm not supposed to love you anymore

Oh I shouldn't care and wonder where and how you are
But I can hide this hurt inside my broken heart
I'm fighting back emotions that I've never fought before
'cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore
I'm fighting back emotions I've never fought before
'cause I'm not supposed to love you anymore
