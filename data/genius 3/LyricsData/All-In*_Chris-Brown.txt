[Verse]
.. oh woah
To leave here with somebody, she doesn't know (oh no)
To try and get feelings, and let it go
Got so many bottles, but she want some more
And you know what I'm on girl

[Pre-Chorus]
So shawty, tell me what you're drinkin' on
All this light, I know it's taking over
Got these Benjamin Franklins, yeah
Just threw it up, and watch it fall on someone
Only balling...
