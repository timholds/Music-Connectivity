[Verse 1: Ben Beamon]
Me, Big and Pac in a black 'lac
Pac got his scar tat, I got my hat back
Big riding shotgun with a Coogi on, looking for CD to roll a doobie on
Blunt hittin' hard, Jack Dempsey
Smoke up in the car, listening to Pimp C
After that, we hit the booth, the killer bee, the track was some J Dilla Heat
The hook went:

[Hook]
Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my music is alive, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga
Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my booth is in the sky, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
In the abyss I resiz-ide, in the skizz-eye
I throw my Polo embroidered angel wings on and flizz-eye
And hit the nearest block party, to jam out with MJ, Pac and Bob Marley
Freestyle with Biggie and Pun, Big Year actin' a fool
Aaliyah ad-libbing to Screw on the 1s and 2s
And I mean everything was chill:
Willie was talking fly, and Marvin Gaye was on the grill
Pimp C sat me down and told me, "Young'n, keep it trill."
"It don't matter what they want, just always do what you feel,"
"If you've gotta press something, be the diamond on the wheel,"
"cause being scared to swang down just ain't no way to live
"cause even old schools show they grills"
Then he said, "Hold up!"
Grabbed some wine, hollered out, "UGK for life!" raised his glass and told me, "po' up"
My granddaddy tapped me on the shoulders
Then my grandma told me they was so proud I showed up with a booth in the sky

[Hook]
Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my music is alive, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga
Even when a nigga been gone, I'mma still live on
Yeah, my booth is in the sky, then shoot me if you try, but I can never die, nigga
