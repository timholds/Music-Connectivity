[Verse 1: Lloyd]
Girl I want you to know that
The love that I have in my heart's for you
And I never knew the feel of real love
'Till you came in my life I didn't know what to do
So I call you little [?] 'cuz your sugar is sweet
Won't you come on over here and give me somethin' to eat
No shit I give her tricks when your love is a treat
Bet that I can give it to ya any day of the week

[Hook: Lloyd]
On call, on call, on call for your love
I'm on call, on, call, on call for your love
I'm on call for your love

[Verse 2: Lloyd]
Girl your love is like a throwback
That's the way that it feels to me
And you know, that I will never wanna hold back
Nothing but real is all I want you to be
So when it comes to lovin' girl I'm tellin' the truth
Never ever felt a pussy that was wetter than you
And there is not a nothing girl that I wouldn't do
For a little piece of loving that I'm needing from you

[Hook: Lloyd & (Big KRIT)]
On call, on, call, on call for your love (Yeah Shawty)
(All you gotta do is hit that hotline right here you know what I'm saying)
I'm on call, on, call, on call for your love
(You know what it is, always and forever)
I'm on call for your love
(Yeah)

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Uh, young Krizzle shawty
One eight hundred lookin' for some lovin' say your down for
Hit me on my celly, I'm at the telly if you [?] for
Don't be shy I know your type, we kick the breeze and chatter chatter
On your acrobatic 'cuz your co workers don't know half the shit you do for me
All so easily
Work it out undercover, you the type of freak I need to see
Show me what you buy, I've been waitin' to get turned out
Eat it up, beat it up, skeet it up then I'm out
'Cuz you know that I'm on call

[Hook: Lloyd & (Big KRIT)]
On call, on call, on call for your love
(Shawty you know that I'm on call)
(This ain't my last stop)
(This ain't your first stop)
(Shit, you know that I'm on call)
I'm on call, on, call, on call for your love
(Shawty you know I'm on call)
(Better hit me one more time)
You know I'm on your line)
I'm on call for your love
(You know that I'm on call)

[Outro]
Ever thought, that life could be, so beautiful, but so lonely
I tried to escape from that
Feelings that just hold me back
You're the ground, upon my head
Shame me once, never again
I go dazing off again
Throw my cautions to the wind
I took the long way home
Just to hear my favourite song again
Reminded me of everything I miss
I let it play on and on
