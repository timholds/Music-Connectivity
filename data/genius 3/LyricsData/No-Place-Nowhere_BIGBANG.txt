Lost in the extraordinary
Lost in your face
Lost on an endless highway
Home in the landscape
Until there's no more stars to guide us
White lines or flares
There's no direction to decide on
When you're Noplace Nowhere hear the
Clear winds whisper thru your hair
Noplace Nowhere
No trace of their city flares
So let's pack up all of our sorrows
We can leave them all behind
If we could just cross the waters
Of distance and time
Noplace Nowhere hear the clear winds
Whisper thru your hair
Noplace Nowhere
No trace of their city flares
