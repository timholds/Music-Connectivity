[Intro]
Straight up, I just wanna say one time after two years in this motherfuckin' crib: fuck all y'all motherfuckers, living all over this motherfucker tryin' to kick me out, that goes for you, Mrs. Watson with your little ass kids always fuckin' crying. You got your little chihuahua, fuck you and your motherfuckin' mama bitch, I'm out here!
Suck my motherfuckin' dick! Here!

[Verse 1]
He's on drugs again
My neighbor's yellin', I don't give a fuck again
And I swear to God if the cops come again
I'ma open up this door, get to rumblin'
Start bussin', bussin', bussin', bussin'
My dick, your mouth, no discussion
Yeah, it's all happenin'
I must be imaginin', take a hit, time travelin'

[Pre-Hook]
Turn up the mothafuckin' volume
And you a freak, why you hidin' in a costume?

[Hook 1]
Let me see them nipples baby
Don't give it all up, just a little, baby
I'm just tryna free your mind
Cause all you see is dollar signs

[Verse 2]
Line crosser, real life flyin' saucer
Nothin' straight 'bout her but her posture
Young prodi-gy, I'ma eat lobster
Pull Spanish bitches but I speak nada
And she got a need to roll the weed all up
You ain't got a chance when it's me on you
I'm a mothafuckin' legend, girl
Get that pussy killed, bitches out in Edinboro

[Pre-Hook]
Turn up the mothafuckin' volume
And you a freak, why you hidin' in a costume?

[Hook 2]
Leave that pussy crippled, baby
Let me slide right down a little, baby
Where the fuck my Thumbalina?
Has anybody seen her face?
She's blinded by the streets

[Outro]
About to start my own motherfuckin' committee and it’s gonna be me and Josh and it’s gonna be motherfuckin' bitches with their motherfuckin' ass and titties, I don’t give a fuck… shit
