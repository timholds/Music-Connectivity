Well I'm on my way to heaven
We shall not be moved
On my way to heaven
We shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved

We shall not we shall not be moved
We shall not we shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved

On the road to freedom

We shall not be moved
On the road to freedom
We shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved

We shall not we shall not be moved
We shall not we shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved

We're brothers together
We shall not be moved
We're brothers together
We shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved

We shall not we shall not be moved
We shall not we shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's standing by the water side
We shall not be moved
