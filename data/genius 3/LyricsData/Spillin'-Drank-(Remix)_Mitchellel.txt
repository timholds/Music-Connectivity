[Intro: Mitchellel]
Ooohhh, ooh baby
I've been working so hard

[Verse 1: Mitchellel]
Seven days a week I've workin' hard
Now I deserve to floss down the boulevard
Thou should try to (?) day
Ladies everywhere, they call me leather plane
Don't worry bout what's in my cup
Look at where I'm from everybody's screwed up
I'm super clean, just left my car on
I might have to turn that (?) round cuh

[Hook: Mitchellel]
I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank
I keep spillin' drank, spillin' drank, spillin' drank
Messin' up my wood grain
I keep spillin' drank, messin' up my wood grain
I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank
I keep spillin' drank, spillin' drank, spillin' drank
Messin' up my wood grain
I keep spillin' drank, messin' up my wood grain

[Verse 2: T.I.]
I'm finna shut the block down, top down, ridin' chrome
Pink shit in my styrofoam
Any man can be killed
But these twin .40 cals I got say I bet I won't die alone
I still ride that 'lac in the name of Pimp
Blind with a hammer and a thing to whip
Bitch ain't fuckin'? she got to go
Shoulda known that before she even came in here
I keep diamonds all in my neck, wood all in my wheel
And broke nigga you ain't talkin' no check
And you ain't talkin' no meal
He's so cool, he's so cool
He's so paid, he's so paid
Your bitch gone choose right in your face nigga, he's so lame
Anyway I got drank drippin' all on the wheel I'm steerin'
Niggas hatin' but the jewelry's so loud, can't hear it, no
I've been gettin' money
Niggas just now gettin' shit I bought brand new two years ago
I got drank poured up and a (?) ray band
Pay the mad black he ain't seen that yet
And anybody gettin' money get a soda (?) and kill it
Just don't spill it, drank

[Hook: Mitchellel]
I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank
I keep spillin' drank, spillin' drank, spillin' drank
Messin' up my wood grain
I keep spillin' drank, messin' up my wood grain
I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank
I keep spillin' drank, spillin' drank, spillin' drank
Messin' up my wood grain
I keep spillin' drank, messin' up my wood grain

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Diamond in the backwood grain make me hold up
Choke up, pour up what the four for
Slabbin' in the ham semi, call me cold cut
I got the kind of (?) that might just shake your ho up
Swole up, rim make it hard for me to roll up
Fifth wheel in it like it gotta grow up
On the curb, no stain when I show up
Never broke down like a center, gotta post up
Coast up, (?)
Dosed up (?)
I'm focused on my okra and perpetrating
It's gator tryna put a fuckin' nigga on my shoulders
No love, niggas turn big when they close up
You was with your bitch and I broke her
Even though you was lov-e-dovy, super sippin', pullin' on choker
Nigga, my beats kill her
Shake that (?) with a pole in the middle
Make a ho play the fiddle
No AC on a hot summer day, I'm cold as the winter
UGK in my dash
Comin' down but don't crash
On the scene actin' bad
Screwed up in my glass

[Bridge: Mitchellel]
My styrofoam keep tippin'
Trynna hold it steady while I'm sippin'
See the money been made already, man
So a nigga ain't really trippin'
Plus I'm leanin', leanin', leanin'
Just poured a deuce up, and I'm leanin', leanin', leanin'

[Hook: Mitchellel]
I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank
I keep spillin' drank, spillin' drank, spillin' drank
Messin' up my wood grain
I keep spillin' drank, messin' up my wood grain
I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank, I keep spillin' drank
I keep spillin' drank, spillin' drank, spillin' drank
Messin' up my wood grain
I keep spillin' drank, messin' up my wood grain
