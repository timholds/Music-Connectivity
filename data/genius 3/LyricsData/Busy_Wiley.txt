[Pre-Hook]
My girl don't like me when I'm busy, I hear her
She on a hype when I'm busy
Even when I say I gotta get this bread
I'm wrong she is always right when I'm busy
Cause I might tell a lie saying that I'm busy
But I'm chilling with a hot gyal listening to Iggy
I be like "Yo please don't be silly"
I holler back tonight if I'm busy
I'm busy

[Hook]
Busy zzzzzzzzzzzzz
Busy zzzzzzzzzzzzz
Busy zzzzzzzzzzzzz
Busy zzzzzzzzzzzzz

[Verse 2]
I was like "babe, this week's schedule might be peak"
Gotta get the album mixed so it sounds right and it don't sound weak
My aim's to get this done though before the end of the week
When it's done I will call you, we can roll out down Oxford Street
But Friday came, I was rambling, raving and raving
She said we're supposed to be saving
I was spending, I was wasting
I was smoking my weed in the basement
With my whole team in a studio session
On a track and Eski Boy reppin'
No half stepping
Riddim get wheel up fast when I step in

[Verse 2]
She was like "babe, I don't think that's a normal job"
She said "your dreams just might melt like butter on corn on a cob"
I said "they may well do but I wanna try a ting anyhow"
"It makes me wanna do it more just cause I've seen so many fail"
And I've got a flow like wow
But she understands how I've been rolling
She can see the pattern, clear
Gyaldem are lurking, far, near
Gyal over here and gyal over there, I know
I ain't gonna say it ain't so
I just go with the flow
I told 'em when I was a yout man
Yeah I'm Wiley, star of the show
