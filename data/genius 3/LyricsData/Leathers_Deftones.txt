[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
This is your chance
Revolt, resist!
Open your chest
Look down, reach in

[Chorus]
Shedding your skin, showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show
You’re cutting your ties, now and forever
Time to let everything outside you

[Verse 2]
This is your test
Come forth, confess!
Extend your tongue
Speak out, go on!

[Chorus]
Shedding your skin, showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show
You’re cutting your ties, now and forever
Time to let everything outside you
Shed your casing
Show your lines and shapes

[Bridge]
Wear your insides, on the outside
Show your enemy, what you look like
What you look like (x2)
From the inside (x2)

Cutting all ties now and forever, time to go

[Chorus + Bridge]
Shedding your skin, showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show
You’re cutting your ties, now and forever
Time to let everything outside you
Shed your casing
Show your lines and shapes
Wear your insides, on the outside
Show your enemy, what you look like
What you look like (x2)
From the inside (x2)
