[Intro:]
This is for all those who feel that they are doubted
And can’t break the negativity of those amongst them
For all those who literally feel like they have to break through a window
In order to get to the other side
For all those who feel strong yet weakened by the grapple of what people tell us we won’t be
Two words:
No more

(Powering Past Power)

[Verse:]
Took me about an hour to power past the power. Killing time
Sick of sitting at the bottom wishing the ceiling’s mine
I’m feeling fine but I’m heavy weight
I constantly hesitate; I’m impossibly steady paced
Colossal is never great in this situation
It sets a fine line between sincerity and true anticipation
With all odds against me, I’m exactly uneven
I’mma pack and then self-attack with a match & no reason

I gather info; post it on your window
In lyrical form and I adjust it to the tempo
Words and beats, I’d set it off properly
Even if you don’t get the music terminology
You can understand

I refuse to take an impact by bruises
No verbal abuses
I “uses” my cranium for saving “them” thoughts to be a favorable element—geranium

I don’t wanna be the top dog, that isn’t me
Just allow me to live and make history
Open your diction’ry, and tell me what you find
Listed under vague, indefinable, and undefined
Then you’ll see what I don’t wanna become:
(Basic), unclear and dumb
I want you all to hear in my flows the true meaning of common sense
I call that one of God’s best accomplishments

It angers me when people hear but won’t listen
Or overlook the meaning of words when they’re written
Frustrate. Smitten. Bad side is showing out
And that’s about the time the bad words are pouring out
And then the profane takes over my domain
Judged by my wheat brown skin, I call that Lo Mein
Man… I’m giving my heart, mind & soul
To dedicating my time to write rhymes and goals

We have our abilities and roles to create a new mechanism, social control
So we can reflect a new sanction
I’ve been showing the strength of the new generation

[Hook:]
I’m powering past power
I power past the power
(x4)

Took me about an hour to power past the power. Killing time
Sick of sitting at the bottom wishing the ceiling’s mine
I’m feeling fine but I’m heavy weight
I constantly hesitate; I’m impossibly steady paced

[End Verse:]
I’m not worried if I disappoint
I’ll only be worried if you miss the point
And by the time that I’m done
We can fix it all with one word
One:
Imagine
Exaction
Authority to stand up
Action
One sound, one voice, that’s better
I said one, that’s unity, together
