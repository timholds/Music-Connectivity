Uh
Betty was worried about the lover that she has married
And she didn't know what to do
He'd been hit by a hammer on the head and he lay dead
An' all her worst fears had come true

{Chorus}
Call the police
Call the police
Call the police
Call the police

Johnny was a joker and a very heavy smoker
And he never ever broke the law
Thin Miss Lizzy was a-kept very busy
And sometimes very dizzy, we knew what for

{repeat chorus}
And take 'em all away
Lock 'em up
{repeat chorus}
{repeat chorus}
{repeat chorus}
{repeat chorus}

Louie was a loner and a big time Al Capone-er
Doin' all his dipping from the door
He knew a shady dealer who had done a dirty DJ
The sooner he could even the score

{repeat chorus}

And lock 'em up
Help ya have a birthday, say
Take 'em all away
