You're hiding behind the face of your victims
An imitation of the ones you killed
Afraid...
To see yourself in the mirror (the mirror lies!)
Afraid...
To be yourself in real life
Bastard! Coward!

I've blackened my inner self of innocence
And it's tearing my soul apart
I'm abused
Misused
Confused
And I died (mentally!)
Am I what you call insane?
My mind decayed with hate, I lost my common sense
Thus cannot tell right from wrong
Revenge!
To avenge with a relentless killing spree!
I cannot be saved no more...
This childhood of mine betrayed
My sanity fades away while sowing my seeds of hate
Now tell me who's to blame!
I'm afraid to be
And afraid to see, to live my life as myself, so a
Chameleon of life I'll be!
I'll escape and be someone else!
Memories from the past keep haunting me
All visions of guilt and shame that will make me cry
Even make me kill!...
And hide my face from you!

Afraid...
To see yourself in the mirror
It lies...
It defies...
To unleash your demise
