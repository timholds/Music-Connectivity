Ain't it amazing when the seasons begin, to change
Someone behind the scenes just seems to pull some strings
I've struggled with an old angel all night long
An I thought it might be nice if we just talked till dawn

I never never gave you...enough
I could've given you...my love

They say that mary magdelene, had it real bad
She took her baby and she headed, off to france
New situtuations don't present themselves, at first
If I was her I don't know where or to who I'dve turned

I never left you with...too much
I could've given you...my love

I hear of people living deep inside of, the earth
They got their own sun and some claim they were here first
I've struggled with an old angel all night long
I thought it might be nice if you stayed here till dawn

I know I left you...alone too much
But I know I need you here...my love
I never thanked you...enough
I could've given you...my love
