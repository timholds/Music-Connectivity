I'm on a highway going the wrong way
I am a long way from home
The road is a straight line
Made to make good time
Made to help people get out of there

And the stars over her might be different
They still bring back these memories of mine

I still remember early december
Dancing on ice with you
Too friendly with strangers
The sudden mood changes
Something not quite right with you

And every star will grow just a little
When certain memories seem to reappear

I still remember early december
Dancing on ice with you
I can't remember feeling in danger
I can't remember much at all

Cause i'm on a highway going the wrong way
I am long way from home
The road is a straght line
Made to make good time
Made to help people get out of here
