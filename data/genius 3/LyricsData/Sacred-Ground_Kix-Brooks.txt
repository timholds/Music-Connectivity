[Verse 1]
We got married in high school, had a baby when we turned eighteen
I bagged groceries in the daytime, at night I learned to fix TV's
When you come by things the hard way
Well you learn how to hold on tight
So don't think you can waltz in here, and take her without a fight

[Chorus]
This ain't just some neon love come lately
Its a precious thing you don't know nothing about
We were joined in the eyes of the Lord, in the eyes of our hometown
Why don't you leave her alone
You're treading on sacred ground

[Verse 2]
Guess I took for granted she would never look at someone else
Now I've got some patching up to do, oh and I don't need your help
I know you're the leaving kind, well I sure hope you will
Before she goes and burns those bridges, that took so long to build

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Go on and leave her alone
Why don't you leave her alone
Go on and leave her alone, you're treading on sacred ground
