[Verse 1: Skrapz]
(BOOM)
Niggas gwarning like there tough but there forcing it
I hit them up and make them niggas unfortunate
I'm grinding in the same tracksuit for so long I might fling onto eBay and try and auction it
I'm in a D&G tee I look staunch in it
I call my gun mixtape cah I'm launching it
Niggers talking about there cars I done had a black benz couple bimmas all my cars had sports in it
My flows dope Innit
Ice city run tings alie though other rappers can't cope innit
Man said I can't rap he's got joke innit
I might grab mans throat and start choking it
I gave my Young buck a rucksack with coke in it
Drop it off to my man but don't open it
I told him yo listen up hustle hard by the end of the year I bet you see the results in it

[Hook Maestro and Skrapz]
Yeah, It ain't easy
Noooo...
It ain't easy
Oh no oh no oh nooooo...
It ain't easy
[Skrapz]: I'm tryna make a change off this rap game
Tired of the weed and the crack game

[verse2 :Likkle T]
Multiplying for the chips
I guess I'm tryna get rich
But I got my mind on these pricks
All eyes on my stick
When I ride on the strip .45 iron with the grip
I'm sick and tired of the shit
It's got me lying to my kid
And now it's got lying to my kids
It's got me lying telling fibs
I'm 25 how I'm gonna rise outta this
Came in the game neutral
Raised in the dark part of life where its crucial
Friends say there friends next minute wannna shoot you
Can't trust a soul in the game that's the usual
Life that I'm used too
Bussin' guns touching funds
On the road clutching son
Anytime we in the battlefield
Already been to war and seem niggers in the battle squeal

[Verse 3:Nines]
I'm on the block with a ting
Free my niggers locked on the wing
Need a shop 3 boxes of cling
Me and that nigga used to roll since Wallabees
Stepping on them yellow bricks but he ain't coming home like Dorothy
Uh, I just left hatton gardens just spent some stacks
Block crowding round the ring like wrestling match
Before I had a strap I kept the blade with me like wesley now I'm a maid niggers like Jefferey
I'm on license but I'm drink driving
My nigga got strip searched with like 6 Z'ds inside him
Lucky to be free still risking my freedom but i'll gang bang as long as them niggers are breathing
People In my life I can't let the corner take it
Gold diggers tryna secure the ting just before I make it
Getting loot now the hoods jealous
But nina got a cut like Paulie in good fellas
