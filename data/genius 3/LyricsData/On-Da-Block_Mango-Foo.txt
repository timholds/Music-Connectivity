[Hook]
Young niggas trappin’ on the block, the money the mission
You runnin’ from 12, throw the dirty stick
Canine on your ass, oh jump the fence
This is the life you live when you hit licks
Kick in the door, make sure nobody snitch
Kick in the wall, found the money and bricks
Bust that shit down with your squad and your clique
Bust down the rollie, put it on your wrist
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb

[Verse 1]
I’m on the mid like Hakeem Olajuwon
Rap up the bricks like a nun
In the bando, ran it up off of crumbs
No Saddam, bitch you know I got bombs
I do it for the niggas in the slums
Pitching the work, throwing underarm
Remix a birdie with arm and hammer
Turn that lil bitch to a dirty dancer
Everybody in the trap got bananas
Every corner on the trap got a camera
Free Playa Made and let him out the slammer
Free my brother, he got caught with some Pamela
Block is a jungle, every man for his self
Fuck a plug, I’ma work for myself
Kick in the door when nobody there
We smoking on cookie, you selling L
Rob a nigga, hit that lick
Mask up, grab that stick
I got him, get the bitch
Where the money, where the bricks?
Ain’t no discussion, I know you got it
I need the bills, no Cosby
Killers geeked up off the coke and the molly
And they all catching bodies

[Hook]
Young niggas trappin’ on the block, the money the mission
You runnin’ from 12, throw the dirty stick
Canine on your ass, oh jump the fence
This is the life you live when you hit licks
Kick in the door, make sure nobody snitch
Kick in the wall, found the money and bricks
Bust that shit down with your squad and your clique
Bust down the rollie, put it on your wrist
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb

[Verse 2]
Wake up and cook a brick, that is my breakfast
Hit for cocaine and sticks, laid down the message
Stand in my trap then you might get a blessing
Birds coming in and out, traffic be hectic
On the block you either hustle or rob
Trap with the stick when you serve out the dog
Break down that soft and then make it that hard
Rerock a brick like I play the guitar
What you doin’, put your wrist in that bowl
I influenced you to put that pot on that stove
This for them niggas still be kicking doors
You can see the street nigga in his soul
I’m on the block where anything goes
Trap for a whole, we wear the same clothes
Workers in the bando sleep on the floor
Don’t come to the door cause everything sold
I got the plug on everything you need
I got a sniper shooting from the trees
Bust down the rollie, spent a quarter key
Finesse the plug, I jugg him down the street
Running from 12, I’m duckin’, tryna lose ‘em
Uzi with coolant, left it in the cooler
I got some young killers, I’m a user
F&N, baby chopper, and the ruger

Kick in the wall, found the money and bricks
Bust that shit down with your squad and your clique
Bust down the rollie, put it on your wrist
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb
For my niggas on the block, for my niggas on the curb
