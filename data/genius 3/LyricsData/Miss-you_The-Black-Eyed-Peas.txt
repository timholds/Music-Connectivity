[will.i.am]
I've been holding out so long
I've been sleeping all alone
Lord, I miss you
I've been hanging on the phone
I've been sleeping all alone
I want to kiss you

[All]
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh

[will.i.am]
Well, I've been haunted in my sleep
You've been starring in my dreams
Lord, I miss you
I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just some friends of mine that say

[will.i.am]
"Hey, what's the matter man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that's just dyin' to meet you"
"We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"

[Fergie]
Oh, everybody waits so long
Oh baby, why you wait so long?
Won't you come home, come home?

[All]
Oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh


[apl.de.ap]

[Taboo]

[Fergie]
I've been walking Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Ask me people, "What's the matter with you boy?"

[All]
"What's the matter with you boy?"

[All]
Aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah aaah
