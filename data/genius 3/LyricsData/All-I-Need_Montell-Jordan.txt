If you just say the word
That I can make you feel alright
I promise that I'll love you
Every morning afternoon and night

Something about you got me crazy
Going out of my mind
I can't believe what's happening
I need to love you all the time

I'll take your hand
Pull you close
Rock you in my arms
Be the one who loves you most

Oh take your time
I'll take you there
Anywhere you wanna go
But there's one thing you should know

1 - You're all I want
You're all I need
My heart and soul
My everything
You're all I want
You're all, you're all I need

Na na na na na now
Now that you're here with me
The table's set, I'm so direct
As we begin to enter into satisfying fantasy
I hit the spot, you move like that
You're on the top, I'm on my back
We're rolling over and it's just like in my dreams

I'll take you there
Pull you close
Rock you in my arms
Be the one who loves you most

Oh take your time
I'll take you there
Anywhere you wanna go
But there's one thing you should know

Repeat 1
You're all I need, baby yes you are

Repeat 1
Yes you are sugar, you're all I need

Repeat 1
All I need, you're so incredible

Repeat 1
Everything I want and so much more

Repeat 1
