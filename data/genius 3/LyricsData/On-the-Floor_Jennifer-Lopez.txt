[Intro: Pitbull & Jennifer Lopez]
J-Lo!
It's a new generation of party people
Get on the floor, dale
Get on the floor
RedOne
Let me introduce you to my party people in the club, ha!

[Verse 1: Pitbull]
I'm loose
And everybody knows I get off the chain
Baby, it's the truth
I'm like Inception, I play with your brain
So don't sleep or snooze
I don't play no games so don't-don't-don't get it confused, no
Because you will lose, yeah
Now pu-pu-pu-pu-pump it up
And back it up, like a Tonka truck, dale!

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
If you go hard, you gotta get on the floor
If you're a party freak, then step on the floor
If you're an animal, then tear up the floor
Break a sweat on the floor, yeah, we work on the floor
Don't stop keep it moving, put your drinks up
Pick your body up and drop it on the floor
Let the rhythm change your world on the floor
You know we're running shit tonight on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
I know you got it, clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rocking, rock it up on the floor
If you're a criminal, kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor, on the floor
Don't stop keep it moving, put your drinks up
It's getting ill, it's getting sick on the floor
We never quit, we never rest on the floor
If I am not wrong, we'll probably die on the floor
Brazil, Morocco, London to Ibiza
Straight to LA, New York, Vegas to Africa

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Dance the night away
Live your life, and stay young on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody, drink a little more
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor

[Bridge: Pibull]
That badonkadonk is like a trunk full of bass on an old school Chevy
Seven-trey donkey donk
All I need is some vodka and some coke
And watch, she gonna get donkey konged
Baby if you're ready for things to get heavy
I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me, dale
Don't believe me, just bet me
My name ain't Keith, but I see why you sweat me
L.A., Miami, New York
Say no more, get on the floor

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Tonight, we gon' be it on the floor
