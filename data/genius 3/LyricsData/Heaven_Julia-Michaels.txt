[Intro]
Ooooh... ooooh...
Oooooh...

[Verse 1]
Love's my religion
But he was my faith
Something so sacred
So hard to replace
Fallin' for him was like fallin' from grace
All wrapped in one
He was so many sins
Would have done anything
Everything for him
And if you ask me
I would do it again

[Chorus]
No need to imagine
'Cause I know it's true
They say "all good boys go to heaven"
But bad boys bring Heaven to you
It's automatic
It's just what they do
They say "all good boys go to heaven"
But bad boys bring Heaven to you

[Verse 2]
You don't realise the power they have
Until they leave you and you want them back
Nothing in this world prepares you for that
I'm not a sinner;
He wasn't the one
Had no idea what we would become
There's no regrets
I just thought it was fun

[Chorus]
No need to imagine
'Cause I know it's true
They say "all good boys go to heaven"
But bad boys bring Heaven to you
It's automatic
It's just what they do
They say "all good boys go to heaven"
But bad boys bring Heaven to you

[Bridge]
I still remember the moment we met
The touch that he planted
The garden he left
I guess the rain was just half that effect

[Chorus]
No need to imagine
'Cause I know it's true
They say "all good boys go to heaven"
But bad boys bring Heaven to you
It's automatic
It's just what they do
They say "all good boys go to heaven"
But bad boys bring Heaven to you

[Outro]
Ooooh... ooooh...
Oooooh...
