I'm dreaming of a white Christmas just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen to hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas with every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright and may all your Christmases be white
(I'm dreaming of a white Christmas)
The sun is shining the grass is green the old pine trees sway
You know there's never been such a day in the good ole USA
Cause it's December the twenty-four that I'm alone and the way out of knowin'
(To hear sleigh bells in the snow)
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas...
