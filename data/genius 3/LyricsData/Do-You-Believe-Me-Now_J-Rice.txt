Ll i ever tried to do was to bring a smile to you
But now i see all the things i failed miserably
But that don't mean that it's ok
I promise that i'm gonna change
I'll start with everything you told me yesterday
Like whenever you call
And ask me to do something so simple, i forget to go at all
And i know it's hard when everytime i let you down again
But can you hear me out

Just turn around
You see me kneeling on the ground
And you won't have to think about if you believe me now
Cos i'll be screaming out and know without a doubt
That i can't live without you here
When all i care about
Is do you believe me now
Do you believe me now

I never wanted to believe that the problem was in me
I guess that's how we got here
Where you say you wanna leave
To find someone who cares cos you don't feel like i do anymore
And you wanna change but you're scared to go alone
And i know it's hard when everytime i let you down again
But can you hear me out

Just turn around
You see me kneeling on the ground
And you won't have to think about if you believe me now
Cos i'll be screaming out and know without a doubt
That i can't live without you here
When all i care about
Is do you believe me now
Do you believe me now

I'm on my knees, do you hear my plead
Can you ever try to forgive me
Cos this is all i can do so if you..

Just turn around
You see me kneeling on the ground
And you won't have to think about if you believe me now
Cos i'll be screaming out and know without a doubt
That i can't live without you here
When all i care about
Is do you believe me now
Do you believe me now
Do you believe me now
Do you believe me now
Do you believe me now
Do you believe me ?
