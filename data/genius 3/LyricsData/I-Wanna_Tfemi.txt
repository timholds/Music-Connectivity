[Intro: Tfemi]
Tfemi
Got my nigga djwreckless out here
James in the studio
Dizzy on the beat
I'm about to kill this track real quick
Gehh x3

[Hook: Tfemi]
I wanna hop out and dab it
I wanna get me a bad chick
I wanna X4
I wanna have a Kardashian
I wanna beat it not tease it
I want it stacked up with karats
I wanna , get it , get breaded, and stay lit, forget it cause no one is touching me

[Verse 1: Tfemi]
Yeah yeah no one is touching me
Rap game endangered and no one can fuck with me
Found me a bad one, get bread like monopoly
Counting my blessings, I stunt no apology
I stunt no apology, they smoking that broccoli
These haters be hating, stop hating be hating , cause none of y'all haters, can get to me

[verse 2: Dixon]
Yeah no one is touching me
These niggas can't fuck with me
I'm killing the game, do it at my pace
Yeah, no one is rushing me
Get into the grain do this everyday yeah
Pull up on a stage now she amazed
Nah no she not cuffing me
Taking shots and I spazz
Fuck these hoes I get cash
Never lose never last
Give me neck then I pass
Give a fuck what they say
Money straight God is great
Team hot summer days
Cross the line you get sprayed
Did this like in two hours give some credit to the boy
Money tall like the twin towers now the kid got a voice
Had no choice now I choose girls
Come in twos like my shoes
Never sleep never snooze
I stack it, I stack it like jews

[Hook: Tfemi]
I wanna hop out and dab it
I wanna get me a bad chick
I wanna X4
I wanna have a Kardashian
I wanna beat it not tease it
I want it stacked up with karats
I wanna , get it , get breaded, and stay lit, forget it cause no one is touching me

[Verse 3: Tfemi]
It's 1'o clock my boy wylin
Quiet hours ain't quiet
Birds coming out the bird nest!
Going ape shit you know what goes next
Bottles got em all freaky
My time piece 550
Celebrate like we won the superbowl ain't no lame lames with me
Plus I still want a maybach
Writing rhymes I go way back
Want some hundred bands, over hundred bands,  gold chain for a hundred bands
And them boys don't matter
Broke niggas no manners
My boy Dizzy in the studio!
Plus your main chick call me goals

[Hook: Tfemi]
I wanna hop out and dab it
I wanna get me a bad chick
I wanna X4
I wanna have a Kardashian
I wanna beat it not tease it
I want it stacked up with karats
I wanna , get it , get breaded, and stay lit, forget it cause no one is touching me
