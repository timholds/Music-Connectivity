[Verse 1]
I played Texas, beer joints and rodeos
Big D arenas, truck stops, casinos
Sang in every dive and joint in Oklahoma
Did hard time in a few in Arizona
Been in every hole-in-the wall from Memphis to Maine

[Chorus]
Out here rockin', rollin'
Mixin' up the fast with the slow ones
Livin', breathin'
Songs about lovin' and leavin'
Mama don't get it, preacher don't understand
Why I'm a singer in a cowboy band

[Verse 2]
I got a guitar banged up as I am
Hit every bar from Buffalo to Cheyenne
I got an outlaw 5-piece combo
I got a tattoo says 'Vaquero'
I dance with the devil, live on one-night stands

[Chorus]
Out here rockin', rollin'
Mixing up the fast with the slow ones
Livin', breathin'
Songs about lovin' and leavin'
Mama don't get it, preacher don't understand
Why I'm a singer in a cowboy band

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I stop, I go to reminiscin'
What it is that I'm out here missin'?
How a blue-eyed boy in church on Sunday
Be raised so right then go the other way
I'll be here until the good Lord calls me home

[Chorus]
Out here rockin', rollin'
Mixin' up the fast with the slow ones
Livin', breathin'
Songs about lovin' and leavin'
Mama don't get it, preacher don't understand
Why I'm a singer in a cowboy band
