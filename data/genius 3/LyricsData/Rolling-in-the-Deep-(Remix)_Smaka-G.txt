[Intro: Adele]
There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch and it's bring me out the dark

Finally, I can see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out and a I'll lay your ship bare
The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside
We could have had it all
You had my heart inside
We could have had it...

[Verse 1: Smaka-G]

You were glad you left me nowadays no you not so sure
Realize that you're diseased and my loves the only cure
Posted at your house alone, nightmares of the thoughts of me
I'm your Freddy Krueger it's Inception and I'm in level 3
Fucking with your head and all, bitch go take some Tylenol
I can make you feel good, Just call me Hank, Monsters Ball
Or Dwayne Johnson cuz without you I'm Walking Tall
Fuck it you should call me sir, I rule the world, sorry Murs
Open Wikipedia keep track of these references?
Or are you still too preoccupied counting out our differences
Let me leave you with these images, in front of all these witnesses
Next time reconsider before you bail out like businesses
Sorry GM I had to do it, My shit goes so hard like Dewey Cox walked through it
Girls want me for my wit, Bring the TP I'm hot shit, Then I'm burning bridges like I'mma star in True Grit
My new girl cradles balls like a baseball mit, and then she spreads her legs, homemade banana split
How's it feel to hear that I'm doing so well, sit back and think about it while the beat switches back to Adele

[Bridge: Adele]
Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you and I'm gonna make your head burn
Think of me in the depths of your despair
Make a home down there as mine sure won't be shared

[Verse 2: Smaka-G]
Surprise surprise I have made my return, Just call me Frodo Baggins and you the ring that I set to burn
I wish that last line wasn't true, spent so much time loving you, and then you go and scratch me off like that hubba bubba on your shoe
But clearly you have made your choice, and that is why you hear my voice, I'll have you to thank when I spend my paycheck on a Royce
My hate for you is what drives me on, my turn to shine It's my baton, I'll defend it never give it up, like a Wolverine, Red Dawn
Hit me up, apologize, let me see regret deep in your eyes, and when you fed me all your lies, I'll walk away and ignore your cries
Hit up a girl she comes to me, Call of Duty
My heartbeat has gone flat, Asian booty
Pardon me for being rude, I'm just a boy, Rihanna knew
This payback is my homework, Got an A and it was way past due
I taught myself to cook this shit, no Cordon Bleu
Now let me pull a Cee Lo Green and leave you with a FUCK YOU!

[Bridge 2:

[Verse 3: Childish Gambino]
Swag
You think that I keep fucking other girls, you know I'm not
Come back to me like hipsters to Blogspot
Let me kiss you on your neck and make your heart stop
I'll give your new dude a fat lip: Pharcyde
I wrote another song, I'm not where I belong
My eyes water when I see hers: catalogue
I never thought you were a cheater, that was all
I need to get ahold of my head: jacking off
You ran back to them girly-ass indie dudes
James Perse cardigans, scuffed-up tennis shoes
Wow, girl, that's what you really wanted, huh?
A Michael Cera knockoff, I guess I wasn't white enough
You said I wasn't capable of loving you, I never was
A twenty-something nigga touring the world with hella buzz
I'm saying that my life's swell: cortizone
Fuck Macaulay Culkin, never going home alone
IPhone photos, show 'em just to mock you
Read your Twitter messages, too proud to block you
Spread shit around, "You know that his glasses fake"
That's why I'm dating girls now whose asses ain't
"Damn, Donald, why you gotta be so mean?"
I'm a nice guy, that's why you broke up with me
You probably in the club dancing to this right now
Play it cool, text me when you walk out

[Hook]
