[Intro]
I wanted to be your friend
I wanted to get to know you
I wanted to be your friend
I wanted to get to know you

[Chorus]
I wanted, I wanted
Wanted to be your friend
I wanted, I wanted
Wanted to be your friend
No kidding

[Verse]
I wanted to hang out some
I thought when you danced, it looked all right
I thought that you talked pretty cool
But don't get me wrong, I wasn't uptight
Intentions, they fly out
The window, when you left
The window stayed open
And light before I said
No kidding
Although it was nothing heavy
These things that I could have showed you
Like how I wanted to be your friend
I wanted to get to know you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Kidding, wanted, wanted
Wanted to, wanted to, wanted to
Wanted to, wanted to, wanted
