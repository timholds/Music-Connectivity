[Verse 1]
Baby, never have I ever wanted anyone like I want you babe
Come and let me show you just how much I feel inside
I got so much love
Oh baby, when I get near you
Ooh, I can't control what I'm feeling
Baby
I got so much love to give you
That I would probably want all the time

[Chorus]
Cariño, Cariño, Cariño, Cariño
I got to have your love, Cariño
Need to feel your touch, Cariño
Never get enough, Cariño, Cariño

[Verse 2]
I wish that I could spend all my days
And nights wrapped in your arms
Spending time with you because all I see
In this world is me and you and no one else, ooh
I want you more and more
Oh baby, please understand me
I think that you deserve me
Because I'm the type that would give you all the love
And affection that you need

[Chorus]
