[Verse 1]
You can't convince me, I'm not the missing
Link to the mystery
{Unsolved}
Created by history, Debated I'm simply
A candence of cleansing
{For all}
I am the seasons, Sprinkled for reasons
So in the spring and fall
{Ya'll}
Never could amount, To what I'm all about
Which furthermore should let you know that
{I'm}
Highly exalted, Cannot re-fault it
I hope my rein is king
{Boss}
Over descendants, I'm independent
You should depend on me
{Cause}
I'm like a savior, from your behavior
Are thou forsaken thee?
{Naw}
I will only bless you, cause I'm here to rescue
From all these fake MC's

[Hook]
Sun, moon, stars
Night, day, sky, and weather
All over the land
We walk seven seas tied together
And we anointing amongst all these dying records
Gotta let'm know I'm forever
{x2}

[Verse 2]
I'm at defenses, now I'm relentless
You cannot prevent this wrath
{No}
Casted upon you, I'm here to warn you
The end is among you fast
{So}
Get ready for Helter Skelter, to welt ya
Refuge and shelters won't help ya
I'm like a ticking time bomb and summon a little napalm
Ready to explode I tell ya
I'm a dramatic act, of a new rap attack
I'll eat you and back
{Cause its less than it}
Got a few out the back, on a new tit for tat
On a lyric comeback
{Wouldn't reckon it}
Cause your food out the bag, I'll eat you like a snack
Then I'll chew you out the back
{To the death of it}
Put'm in the trash, with the rest of'm
Living like Kelvin, a cold ass piece of a specimen
When the beat drop, pleat not
He hops on on to the east meet sun sheet, plenty rock
Imma beast, at least, gotta feast weak on MC's till the memo drops
You so redundant, I'm so abundant
As big as they come with style
Bigger than the new world order, I'm the new world order to reprimand to take you down

[Hook]
{x2}

The end is upon you now, what you thought the end would be any different?
Your career is underground, buried away with no sign of remembrance
{Sure}
It makes you wonder how nobody of one could bring so much significance
Now I gotta search up through the rubbage, to see if I can salvage to see if I can find anything worth listening
Lookie lookie here, Kutt Calhoun new rookie of the year
Finally some substance, content, metaphor
Brand new start, everything's all clear
He could be the one to lead you, guide you, and teach you, the ways of a new found growth
Behold the creator of all rap kind
Ease your mind, my child, if you didn't know I am forever

[Hook]
