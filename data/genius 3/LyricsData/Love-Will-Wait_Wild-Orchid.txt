Lying here alone with you
So able to be free
How easy it would be
To give you all of me

I'm closer to you now
Closer than I have ever been before
As my body starts to give it all
My heart stops to be sure that

Love will wait
More than just a minute
I'm telling you that
Love will wait
It holds what lies within it
And time will only help us grow
And when we let these feelings go
Waiting there will be love

I feel the ticking of your heart
It's beating so close to mine
Still I don't want to go too far
Until I know that it's right

Someday when we explore
When we explore the world that's yet unknown
The beauty of it will be worth
The patience that we've shown

Love will wait
More than just a minute
I'm telling you that
Love will wait
It holds what lies within it
And time will only help us grow
And when we let these feelings go
Waiting there will be love

We've both been there before
At times too blind to see
That love will wait...(Love will wait)
And when I open up my eyes
I see your face still smiles
That's when I know that

Love will wait
More than just a minute
I'm telling you that
Love will wait
It holds what lies within it
And time will only help us grow
And when we let these feelings go
Waiting there will be love
