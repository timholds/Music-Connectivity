[Verse 1]
How do you get your sleep at night?
How do you get your noose so tight?
Like chewing on tinfoil it's so much fun
Gonna be dead before we're gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Just look how things have gotten
And I'll be happy so i won't pretend
And I'll be cheering that you're going down
And I'll be laughing
I'll be laughing

[Verse 2]
How many feelings can you steal?
Gotta be part of your appeal
And I can see through you cause you're wearing thin
Like chewing on tinfoil once again

[Pre-Chorus]
Just look how things have gotten
And I'll be happy so i won't pretend
And I'll be cheering that you're going down
And I'll be laughing
I'll be laughing

[Chorus]
Haha, you're dead
And I'm so happy
In loving memory of your demise
When your ship is going down
I'll go out and paint the town
Haha, you're dead
Haha, you're dead
Haha, you're dead

[Chorus]
Haha, you're dead
And I'm so happy
In loving memory of your demise
When your ship is going down
I'll go out and paint the town
Haha, you're dead
Haha, you're dead
Haha, you're dead

[Outro]
Haha, you're dead
This joke is over
You were an asshole
And now you're gone
When your ship is going down
I'll sit back and watch you drown
Haha, you're dead
Haha, you're dead
Haha, you're dead

Haha, you're dead
You're gonna be dead
Just remember what I said
Haha, you're dead
Haha, you're dead
Haha, you're dead
