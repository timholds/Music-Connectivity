A beautiful girl
A beautiful irish girl
A beautiful girl
Cathleen

And if the song that I write is no good
Won't you listen to it please anyway
And if the words that I write are misunderstood
Won't you listen to them please anyway
This song is for cathleen

Cathleen
Cathleen
A beautiful girl cathleen
Cathleen
Cathleen
A beautiful girl cathleen

And if you hear I was kissing another
Don't be jealous it's only your mother
So take it from father to daughter
This song is for cathleen

And if you hear that I kissed your sister
Don't be jealous for how could I resist her
Don't be angry for one day you might miss her
She's oh so like cathleen

So if the song that I write is no good
Won't you listen to it please anyway
And if the words that I write are misunderstood
Listen to them please anyway
This song is for cathleen
