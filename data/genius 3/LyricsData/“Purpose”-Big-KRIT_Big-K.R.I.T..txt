[Intro]
*Baby crying*

[Verse: Big KRIT]
I was born in '86, despite the wolves and rats
Survived the wild and returned with these bear furs on my back
To feed the family, drink the wine
Give thanks to God and watch for signs
The winter's cold
But we was chose to rise above the darkened skies
And fight against what lied beneath
My feet are firmly on the ground
Prepare my soul and grit my teeth
Fight or flight is going down
What man amongst me says
That I ain't fit to wear my Father's crown
A King of Mine and mine alone
My blood line can't be renounced
Stand up and be counted for
Raise your fist as Glory speaks
Heavens what I'm dying for
I swear the Devil's at war with me
I deal with life accordingly one day at a time
And that kingdom we all searching for
I pray one day we find
So many have long and gone
So many got left behind
But as time travels and Earth unravels
Church bells still chime
Planets still align as angels watch over
I break the chains they gave me
And put these medals on my shoulders
Cause I ain't no simp

[Outro]
You'll be different
You'll find comfort in family
Your power lies in your faith and beliefs
What's a king without a crown?
Or a kingdom to call his own?
This is purpose
