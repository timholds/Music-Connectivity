My home is a prison
I'm livin' in a world of tears
My home is a prison
I'm livin' in a world of tears
I been in misery
Since the judge give me ninety-nine years

I had a real pretty woman
Say'd, she didn't love no one but me
I had a real pretty woman
Say, she didn't love no one but me
But I caught my baby, cheatin'
My home ain't where it used to be

I got bread and milk for breakfast
Milk and bread at supertime
I got bread and milk for breakfast
Milk and bread at the supertime
And the food I got for dinner
It's a low down, dirty crime

Yes, I shot my baby
I did it because she treated me wrong
I shot my baby
Did it because she treat me wrong
Now, the only thing I have
This lonesome jail that I call home
