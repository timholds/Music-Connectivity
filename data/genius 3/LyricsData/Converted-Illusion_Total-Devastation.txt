Through my senses
Obstacles within
Dreams carried up
Imagination has begun

See - Control of my utopia beyond
Feel - Emotions aroused by my agony
Dream - Anxiety of my utopia beyond
Fantasize - Convert the cycle of illusion

Through my senses
Myself seeing in mirror
The subconscious battles between
Myself seeing in terror

See - Control of my utopia beyond
Feel - Emotions aroused by my agony
Dream - Anxiety of my utopia beyond
Fantasize - Convert the cycle of illusion

Say no more about anything
Relief not in available anytime
These morbid thoughts of my own
Please help, nobody can

Anything...
Anytime...

Time no matter what to do
Cause and effect all the same
Struggle in the dreadfulness
Dying must be the cure

Say no more about anything
Relief not in available anytime
These morbid thoughts of my own
Please help, nobody can

Anything...
Anytime...
