[INTRO]

Real *scratching* real, real hip hop [2X]

From the soul...

[Verse 1: DL Incognito]

It started with my MPC
Grew to BETA SP's
Now it's, years later three-sixty degrees
Not much changed but the cut of my jeans
I'm eating more greens, my momma always said you gotta eat
So I take the salad over fries, the truth over lies
Besides that, still the same guy right?
Got my feet wet, learned the ropes
Niggas checking for my shit under the microscope
I stay afloat of those who don't believe in the DL & NP
Indirectly, you need the strength to succeed
A live feed took it on tour
Niggas waiting patiently for the encore
Need not wait more
Show 'em my potential on my first LP, knew it
Took a sample and drums, made real music
Force the fans ask the question, who's this?
Where he from, he be reppin' what clique?
He's sick

[HOOK]

Real *scratching* real, real hip hop [2X]

From the soul...

[Verse 2: DL Incognito]

Now on planets, we built our own Lego blocks
So don't be annoyed if ya need to see if my shit's hot
I know this
I made it through this world without my pops
He's bogus
Many going through the same shit
It's not hopeless
My mother held it down, kept me focused on my task
At last, I understand the math
The science and the path I had to take
The struggle of another day
The sacrifices made along the way to become great
Some kings shed blood like the centre of a steak
I used my poetry to infiltrate the human race
I put it all on paper this time, so you can better understand my rhymes
Nigga
And no son I'm not wasting your time
I'm not wasting your money I encourage you to buy
The last shall be first one day, we will rise
The problems of the world are greater than you and I

From the soul...

[Verse 3: DL Incognito]

So flawless when I recite on mics, they call me dirty
Elegant, my pen is never worried
My council is like a clergy
I'm in my 20's now everyday closer to 30
I'm grown up but man though it's still early
I hope the youngin niggas soon don't forget what hip hop is
So it can be around for my kids
For real
Life by experience, the shit it's ill
My deliverance is that of only skill
I build like the great minds that did Egypt
I'd rather see the pyramids than a precinct
Stopped by the cops on the block for no reason
We gotta keep running everyday, it's open season
But who's really poilicing?
The smogs like the morgue in the city, we ain't breathin'
We barely even, just getting by
The struggle's still the same, see the pain in my eyes
Sometimes I just don't think they hear the cries
