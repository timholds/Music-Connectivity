[Hook]
Feel like I'm falling down
Feel like I'm falling down again
Somebody lift me, somebody lift me
Feel like I'm falling down
Feel like I'm falling down again
Somebody lift me, somebody lift me

[Verse 1: Omen]
As I sit in my room, these walls seem to cause me to pause
No fans, no applause, I'm lost
I fall to the bed in my draws
Thinking, thinking some things that make me realize
I've gone way down, way down to the deep end
Reaching, with nothing to grab
These songs ain't pumping the gas
How long do it take for a dream to come true when I swear
I'm just tossed as a crab in a bucket
But it ain't number six, feeling like bozo
But I keep trucking in slow-mo
Man life is a slowpoke, but I dare hold no grudges

[Hook]
Feel like I'm falling down
Feel like I'm falling down again
Somebody lift me, somebody lift me
Feel like I'm falling down
Feel like I'm falling down again
Somebody lift me, somebody lift me

[Verse 2: Omen]
This feeling creeps like a thief
All he left was doubt and stole belief
My excuse is gone, I could use one now
Please don't bring me up just to bring me down
Aye, aye, Is it stress or is it depression?
Cause it sure don't feel like a blessing
Don't feel like it came from the essence
Feel like somebody shot my intestines
Destined for the sadness of the world
My heart's been darkening
Lately, me and my girl been arguing, broke up
Now it's worse than the arguments
How'd we get so far from the start of it?
So bad, now we might never talk again
Ask God, why my life being targeted
Swear he reply like I ain't got no part in this
So I brought up the pen and I escape from the thoughts of my brain
Leave them tossed on the page with the strongest intention
All day, I done fought in a rage, feeling lost in a cage
And I'm caught in suspension, so tired of this roller coaster
One minute I'm cool, next minute I'm close to tears
I bet regret is coming to get me
A cellmate of sorrow, somebody lift me

[Hook]
I'm falling down again
Feels like I'm falling down
I'm falling down again
