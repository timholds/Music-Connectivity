[Verse 1]
Baby, come over here, let's lay down
Whisper in my ear, oh, I love that sound
Close your eyes, feel my touch
Oh, I'll die tryin', to give you as much

[Chorus]
'Cause your kind of love's the best ever made
Makes me wanna come home at the end of the day
And fall into your arms
Where I'm safe from harm
Yeah, you're warm like the sun, new like a dream
You're heart and soul, you're showin' me things
That I've never seen
And I can't get enough of your kind of love

[Verse 2]
Know there was a time, not that long ago
Oh, they called me a cowboy, no one could rope
Baby, look at me, give me another kiss
If I'da kept on movin', look what I'd have missed

[Chorus]
Yeah, your kind of love's the best ever made
Makes me wanna come home at the end of the day
And fall into your arms
Where I'm safe from harm
Well, you're warm like the sun, to me like a dream
You're heart and soul, you're showin' me things
That I've never seen
Oh, I can't get enough of your kind of love

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Oh, your kind of love's the best ever made
Makes me wanna come home...
Fall into your arms
Where I'm safe from harm
Yeah, you're warm like the sun, to me like a dream
You're heart and soul, you're showin' me things
That I've never seen
And I can't get enough of your kind of love
