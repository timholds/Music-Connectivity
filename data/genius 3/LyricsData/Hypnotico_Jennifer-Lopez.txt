[Intro]
All of the girls that know that they're sexy, c'mon!

[Verse 1]
Flip it, slap it down, it's going to get nasty
(Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico)
Shimmy-shakers, earthquakers up in the city
(Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico)
They love me for my body, I'm original sexy
(Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico)

[Chorus]
All the boys, all love it when we do our thing
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We are tonight
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys, all love it when we do our thing
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We are tonight
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight

[Interlude]
Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico

[Verse 2]
Red eyes widen, envious smiling
(Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico)
Sunburned, baby
Hurts like crazy
(Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico)
Hungry for some yum, yum
Gonna get me some, some
(Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico)

[Chorus]
All the boys, all love it when we do our thing
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We are tonight
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys, all love it when we do our thing
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We are tonight
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight

[Breakdown]
Aah! (Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico)
Aah! (Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico)

[Bridge]
All the boys go crazy, all the boys go crazy
(Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico)
Whine up your body like you're a boricua
All of the men have a silly heartbreaker
(Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico)

[Chorus]
All the boys, all love it when we do our thing
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We are tonight
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys, all love it when we do our thing
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We are tonight
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight

[Outro]
Tonight, tonight!
All the boys all want it, but it don't mean a thing
We are tonight
We’re just some silly heartbreakers tonight
(Hypnoti-notico, hypnoti-notico)
