Baby We Can Ride
Got My Car Parked Right Outside
I'll Even Let You Drive
That's Cool With Me
Yo When U Hear Da Horn It Means I'm In My Ride Outside
I Got My Boys Rollin Wit Me, Bring Ya Girls Tonight
But They Can Give A Little Time So We Can Kick It Alone
And If They Don't Cooperate Just Know I'm Taking Them Home
It's Nothing Personal To Them
It's Just I'm Feeling You More
See I Could Take U For A Ride And May Be Do A Bit More
So Come And Take A Ride With Me
I Know U Know That U Should
U Know I'll Have You Wonderin How I Do So Good
You'll Be Like This
(Shall I Roll With You)
Yes U Should, U Be Like This
(Would I Get With You)
Yes I Would, U Be Like This
(Could You Do Me Good)
