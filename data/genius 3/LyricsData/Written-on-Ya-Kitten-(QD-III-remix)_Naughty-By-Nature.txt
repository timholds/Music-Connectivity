Oh lord have mercy come again, come again
I'm making other people's pussycats max if your nookie
That's, good for your voice, plump, trump and moist
Rub me where you love me face the waist some takes his choice
Plenty many ladies try to pay me the lady
I got motts but worse that cost a lot baby, baby (baby, baby)
Kitty Kat hittin kid from the corner, wanna quest the rest of your nest
Straight from my shower to your sauna, yup!
Next crew, this ain't no Pepé Le Pew, this is what we do, Ménage à trois we do
Too mean, too mad, too much to handle
Name is written like a Martin lit that kitten with a candle
And if ya go court on that have a rate court stuff, come take a short cut to Fort Nuts!
Many praise the way we play (Well you know)
What can I say?
Hit 'em low!

Oh where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty kat at stroking me? (Hoping she's open G)
Oh where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty kat at stroking me?
Oh where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty kat at stroking me? (Hoping she's open G)

On and on, I coulda sworn I saw puddy cat, city titty cat, witty pretty cat
OH WHERE THE HELL IS MY KITTY KAT!
Pretty patter craps, then I lick her paw, looks like a thicker broad, thick as a brick, time to pick the draws
Now every time my waterfall blows, I'm at the tip her toes going yo, GERONIMO!
Got my name written in missiles, capitals, lower-case, show your face, cursive and big initials
I mow the lawn every season, call me Mr. Green Thumb, cause I'm pushing pushers giving me ones
Cook up the stew and keep steppin', I started another life with your wife after we met at y'all reception!
I saw your think down in the kitchen, now she does kev does head the dirty laundry plus does dishes
Before the hittin though on your mitten, and don't stop stickin'!
Until it's written on her kitten!

Halleujah! Hip Hop Hooray!
I'm up six hours early, it's a kitten hittin day
The dog catcher doesn't speak, his moves switches cause, I catch the pussycat and he catches all the bitches!
I go for cats plus ball hard, but you can never get the perro or the fur from a bulldog
So I'm back for the cat, give up the nappy stat!
So I can take a cat nap!
Oh yea I like my pussycat deep, so if she's tired of sleep, I have some place to soak my feet
I see some looking for a bigger knot, what a nigga got, just make sure there's satin sheets in your litter box
That's when they hit us a problem
Make sure the room is hot and locked with Gangsta Bitch in the Boombox! (in the Boombox!)
I oughta chill and leave happily
And if somebody knocks it after me there be a Catastrophe!
You don't ever let me get a little bit, for the kibbles 'n bits, I hit for nipples and tits! (nipples and tits!)
Always due to hittin with a lubricated mitten, some do lickin' stickin' just to get it written on their kitten
