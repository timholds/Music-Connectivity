Out of my mind, deep in despair
I didn't feel, I didn't care
Spirit broken, my will was gone
Theres nothing left to keep me hanging on
Then out of some where a savior came
Pulled me in, and took away my pain
I ain't singing that song no more
I burned that bridge and then I swam ashore
Ohh, the river it was deep and wide
But you were waiting on the other side
I ain't singing that song no more
Talked about our hopeless calls, a lost soul, thats what I was
I felt nobody could hear my cries
As I sit and witnessed my own demise
Then out of some where the savior came
Pulled me in, and took away my pain
I ain't singing that song no more
I burned that bridge and then I swam ashore
Ohh, the river it was deep and wide
But you were waiting on the other side
I ain't singing that song no more
I ain't singing that song no more
I burned that bridge and then I swam ashore
Ohh, the river it was deep and wide
But you were waiting on the other side
I ain't singing that song no more
I ain't singing that song no more
I burned that bridge and then I swam ashore
Ohh, the river it was deep and wide
But you were waiting on the other side
I ain't singing that song no more
