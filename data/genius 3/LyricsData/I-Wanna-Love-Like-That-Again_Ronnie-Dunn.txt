[Verse 1]
A whiskey haze in the pale smoke, dancin' through your hair
Soft light of the afterglow is, lightnin' in the air
Rolled up, took a slow breath, lit a cigarette
I can't say I know what that was but it was, good as it gets

[Chorus]
It's like the, song plays, and the words just rhyme
Right place, right time
One of those things that just kinda happens
When the blind lead the blind
It don't matter the whys, the whens
I wanna love like that again

[Verse 2]
You looked at me with that come on smile, [?] baby I want you [?]
Lead me off into the great unknown, oh what a heart
Hear in the noise of the quiet still, the crazy mystery
Feelin' baby what it's like to feel, what you just did to me

[Chorus]
It's like the, song plays, and the words just rhyme
Right place, the right time
One of those things that just kinda happens
When the blind lead the blind
It don't matter the whys, the whens
I wanna love like that again

[Chorus]
It's like the, song plays, and the words just rhyme
Right place, the right time
One of those things that just kinda happens
When the blind go leadin' the blind
It don't matter the whys, the whens
I wanna love like that again

[Outro]
Love like that again
