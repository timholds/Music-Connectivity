[Verse]
Fuck being on some Drake shit
I got 0-100 nigga real quick
I be on my 2chainz_onabure shit
And I don't feel this shit, not even a lil bit
Oh, Lord
Go to work, get paid nigga
Go to the party, get laid nigga
On my Elvis Presley, blue suede nigga
Shouts out to Iyaz, replayed nigga
Can't trust anyone these days
They be snitching on you every type of way
This got me feeling some type of way
Bure teaching these niggas today
Stay loyal to the fam
Or people will look at it like a sham
I want you to stay true like Uncle Sam
And now you niggas stuck like a traffic jam
Kung-fu, now I'm leaving all you niggas confused
I be finding shit like Blue's Clues
Looking out the window like I'm still waiting for Drake's Views from the 6
Open up my bag of tricks
You niggas watching while time ticks
Nobody messing with my clique
My boy David darker than an oil slick, ha!
Shouts out the deceased, I hope you niggas rest in peace
To Chinx and A$AP Yam
Everybody in the world is game is dying, goddamn
What's up man? How you doing man?
I'm reppin' ABZ and ATL fam
Leo da Vinci, renaissance man
But I never wanna grow up, Peter Pan

[Outro]
Real quick, real quick, whole squad on that real shit
0-100 nigga real quick
Real quick, real real quick boy, boy
Shouts out to some people real quick
Shouts out to my boy James Cooper
Shouts out to Tyler Handin
Shouts out to my entire grade, we hittin' it
Class of 2018, we reppin'
We reppin'
Yeah
