[Verse 1]
I wanna make you feel good
Wanna make you feel good
Look in my eyes
And tell me your darkest secrets
I would not judge
And I promise that I’m gonna keep it
You never be lonely again girl x2

[Verse 1]
See I ain’t be around the block enough to recognize a real one And I can see it in your eyes that you see one When both have our hearts broke, it mean some That’s why I understand the pain that you come from Baby just follow me
Follow me
I wanna be the one who show you the honesty
Baby just follow me
I need you to be down for me

[Chorus]
Oh Marilyn x2
You'll never be lonely
Lonely again
Oh Marilyn x2
You'll never be lonely
Lonely again
Bring it all home to me
Marilyn x2
Bring it all home again
Marilyn x2
Bring it all home again

[Verse 2]
Open your heart and tell me where I can find it
Let down your walls, girl I bring no problem with me
You never be lonely with me x2
See we don’t ned nobody else
Fuck opinion, I can lay you in the right way
Wanna make you feel good in the right place
Wanna be your lover, best friend and your soul mate
Tell me how I can

[Chorus]
Oh Marilyn x2
You'll never be lonely
Lonely again
Bring it all home to me
Marilyn x2
Bring it all home again
Marilyn x2
Bring it all home again

[Bridge]
Come down and waste a way with me
Down, down with me
Come down and waste a way with me
Come down with me
Down with me
Come down and waste a way with me
Come down with me
