[Intro: Shakka]
Yeah
(I-i-i-incredible)

[Chorus: Shakka]
Run out of rum, re-up the cup
Ah, you know my ting
She wants to laugh cause of the 'ha'
Ah, you know my ting
Dark skin or light, ain't got a type
Ah, you know my ting
We spend pounds, you make sounds
Ah, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, she already know my ting
She ready to home and ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting, shut up

[Verse 1: Ghetts]
Rude boy
Got your baby in my new toy
I made Abbie National
I took Nat west before you Lloyd
My turn
I was in this queue before you joined
IBIS, night shift
She don't deserve no penthouse viewpoint

[Pre-Chorus: Ghetts]
Don gorgon, don dada
Dun all of them, man's badder
Mr Lover Lover like Shabba
And all the peng tings in the manor
No skeletons in my wardrobe
Just bags worth of swagger
What the fuck's that on your torso?
That ain't worth the hanger

[Chorus: Shakka]
Run out of rum, re-up the cup
Ah, you know my ting
She wants to laugh cause of the 'ha'
Ah, you know my ting
Dark skin or light, ain't got a type
Ah, you know my ting
We spend pounds, you make sounds
Ah, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, she already know my ting
She ready to home and ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting, shut up

[Verse 2: Ghetts]
Bad man
Your wife's postcode in my Sat-Nav
WiFi code in my iPhone
Leave the toilet seat up and smash that
So many condoms in the trash bag
Man's gonna think  its a gang bang
Man's got a girl doing cartwheels, backflips, handstands

[Pre-Chorus: Ghetts]
Don gorgon, don dada
Dun all of them, man's badder
Mr Lover Lover like Shabba
And all the peng tings in the manor
No skeletons in my wardrobe
Just bags worth of swagger
What the fuck's that on your torso?
That ain't worth the hanger

[Chorus: Shakka]
Run out of rum, re-up the cup
Ah, you know my ting
She wants to laugh cause of the 'ha'
Ah, you know my ting
Dark skin or light, ain't got a type
Ah, you know my ting
We spend pounds, you make sounds
Ah, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, she already know my ting
She ready to home and ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting, shut up

[Chorus: Shakka]
Run out of rum, re-up the cup
Ah, you know my ting
She wants to laugh cause of the 'ha'
Ah, you know my ting
Dark skin or light, ain't got a type
Ah, you know my ting
We spend pounds, you make sounds
Ah, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, she already know my ting
She ready to home and ting
Fam, you know my ting
Fam, you know my ting, shut up
