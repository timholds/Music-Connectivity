[Verse 1]
This is a call to arms
To live and love and sleep together
We could flood the streets
With love or light or heat, whatever
Lock the parents out
Cut a rug, twist and shout
Wave your hands, make it rain
The stars will rise again

[Chorus]
The youth are starting to change; are you
Starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change; are you
Starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together

[Verse 2]
In a couple of years
Tides have turned from boos to cheers
And in spite of the weather
We can learn to make it together

[Chorus]
The youth are starting to change; are you
Starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change; are you
Starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together, together

[Chorus]
The youth are starting to change; are you
Starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change; are you
Starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change; are you
Starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together
The youth are starting to change; are you
Starting to change, are you?
Together, together, together, together
Together, together, together

[Outro]
The youth
The youth
The youth
The youth
