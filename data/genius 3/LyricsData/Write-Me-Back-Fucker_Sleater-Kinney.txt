I got your letter today
I read the things you had to say
The things that you took back(??)
Are always the same

Did you get my letter?
Did you get it today?
I got a letter
I threw it away

You always bring up the things
You want me to explain
Alright, i'll do it, my heart is dead
Alright, i'll do it, my heart is dead

Did you get my letter?
Did you get it today?
Yeah, i got a letter
I threw it away

Why do you always write to me
When you don't read a word i say

I wrote a letter today
I underlined what i had to say
Alright, i'll do it, my heart is dead
Alright, i'll do it, my heart is dead
