When I passed you in the doorway
Well, you took me with a glance
I should have took that last bus home
But I asked you for a dance

Now we go steady to the pictures
I always get chocolate stains on my pants
And my father he's going crazy
He say's I'm living in a trance

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's all right, all right
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

It's three o'clock in the morning
And I'm on the streets again
I disobeyed another warning
I should have been in by ten

Now I won't get out until Sunday
I'll have to say I stayed with friends
Oh but it's a habit worth forming
If it means to justify the end

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's all right, all right
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

And I'm walking home
The last bus is long gone
But I'm dancing in the moonlight

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's all right, all right
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's all right, all right
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night

But I'm dancing in the moonlight
It's caught me in its spotlight
It's all right, all right
Dancing in the moonlight
On this long hot summer night
