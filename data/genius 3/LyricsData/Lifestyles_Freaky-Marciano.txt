[Verse 1: Freaky Marciano]
I had a dream, I woke up full of sweat
And in that dream, i was standing on the devils steps
They gave my man 14 and he ain’t lose his breath
Knowing the fact he didn’t do it ain’t removing stress
The crew was blessed, popping bottles through the late nights
Thoughts of Mama Joyce will take away the stage fright
Regret that ungrateful time and delayed flights
And since I’m loyal, my decisions kept the gang tight
I gain stripes, I give em up to get my brothers back
Rest in peace, you know we love you and you love us back
Dreams of a Rolls Royce, there ain’t enough of that
To tell my family that i got ‘em made me love the trap
I never slack, I got these reasons why i’m always strapped
I ain’t a trouble maker throw em but i’ll throw em back
I got the visions of a soldier with a real impact
Waking up in a new Bugatti, now how real is that?
Motherfucker

[Chorus: Cardi]
I’m having dreams of that Rolls Royce
When I wake up in a new Bugatti, tell my family I got em
Yeah and I’m stuck in these closed walls, no ways out
Politics is polished to keep me at the bottom
I’ve been suffering from dreams of that Rolls Royce
When I wake up in a new Bugatti, tell my family I got em
Yeah and I’m stuck in these closed walls, no ways out
Politics is polished to keep me at the bottom

[Verse 2: Eazy Get Rite]
Okay back to this fly shit
I’m that nigga they getting high with
They hating on Polo niggas could die
Quit you sidekicks, G-O-M-D I bet you know though
Express already expressed that so here we go, oh
Before that it was fall back and get clapped
I ain’t talking no audience, I’m talking more
You fuck around, get held by 6
Get the pic? Photo shoot shit
Touchdown hoes claiming they bad
Some neighborhood bust down
Been around snow points
From the club to my man joint
Clown niggas wrestle these bitches
I swear their so doink, You fuckers
I’m mister quicker picker upper
Put a bounty on your bitch
Because I’m quick to pick her up-ah
On this plane, let Mary fuck her brain
It’s a shame, how every nigga with they own swag, still the same
You lames, pick a lane and drive straight
If you hungry, my nigga, get a snickers and why wait? It’s easy

[Chorus: Cardi]
I’m having dreams of that Rolls Royce
When I wake up in a new Bugatti, tell my family I got em
Yeah and I’m stuck in these closed walls, no ways out
Politics is polished to keep me at the bottom
I’ve been suffering from dreams of that Rolls Royce
When I wake up in a new Bugatti, tell my family I got em
Yeah and I’m stuck in these closed walls, no ways out
Politics is polished to keep me at the bottom
