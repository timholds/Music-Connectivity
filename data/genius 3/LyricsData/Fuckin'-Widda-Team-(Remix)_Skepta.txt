[Intro]
Shh hut yuh muh
Joseph Junior Adenuga
Old tight Kane
Skepta on the microphone
Oi Dan Stacey, I know you can see me
Yo

[Skepta]
I used to put 13 scores in my mouth, & start chopping up a next ounce with H
Can't chat to Meridian about weight, u man wouldn’t even know what to do with an 8
U say you’re balling on the 24, you’re still tryna move it on the 8th
Dem boys don’t know bout tanitas with the batteries held in with sellotape
U would’ve thought u were looking at your date of birth when I put my food on the scales
When I get shift I start biting my nails
Never ever been an informer never told tales
I roll with 4 black males, feds better lock us in separate jails
Dizzee Rascal should’ve phoned my phone cause we regulate all the class A sales

[Kano]
My flow’s still big, realness, nigga wheel this, bloodclart track cause niggas feel this
No matter how big though niggas will diss, even though I caught this lyric illness
Colder than flu u say u married the game that’s why it sounds like this was borrowed & blue
Mix old & new, make hit minder but one priority that the kids know the truth
U know its who? K to the fuckin, A with the flow ain't nobody touching
We seen ur videos know that you’re nothing, nuff man, champagne, nobody bussin
We locked the game u can't get a touch in, nigga im like Mourinho sub him
Track murderer before Rhianna & I made mic check before Santana
Presidential flow, badder than Bush, out with the brap in widda zoop zoop
Fuck boundaries they’re bound to be pushed, the calm before the storm nigga thou shush
Shh its all so quiet fuck that shit I predict a riot, cause im still on the grind of writers so ring the alarm the other sound that's dying
I put in my work you're skiving, i chipped in you're still arriving
Im nice & you're surviving, u ain't sold no record you're lying
& for the record, still got the mixtape shit on lock too & im pon lock too
Thats 21 if u didn't know it, yeah that's 32 & im still going
From bar 1 i said reload it but it took 4 bars for u to notice
Hit 8 bars i was like hold this way too bonkers thats what the flow is
& i never wrote a 16 so quick 24 more u ain't fuckin widda team
That's how i know im so sick, 40 bars u ain't fuckin with me

[Ghetts]
Im analysing the game & its time in a lane im expensive like hiring a plane
I got the fire in my veins im setting the scene alight no point getting ur team to fight
I don't wanna end up getting a 3-5, i ain't letting ur team survive niggas ain't threatening me im nice
I don't wanna settle the beef im hype, on the level im T for Strydes
Come widda kettle & heat a guy, so don't fuck widda team u ain't cut for the scene
Duck when i buss yeah i buck with machines & the butterfly knife might butterfly guys
Off in the gutter so fuck a nice life so fuck widda team & ur mother might die
U ain't a nutter like I you're a sucker why try...

[Skepta]
If u wanna fuck widda team we can Rinse it we can even  Heat FM 9.66 it
Oi Maximum don't mix it, i wanna fuck him up so bad not even jimmy could fix it
Go on then stir it & whisk it, i start spitting out fire like a 38 biscuit
Dunno why these man are fuckin widda team when not even Rooney would risk it
Go on then spit a 32 bar lyric i'll rustle up an 8 bar lyric to dun ur lyric
If its lyrical war then im in it, after i win it, lift up the trophy & kiss it
Anytime u want a rematch come to the studio opposite Dexplicit
Don't wanna fuck widda team don't bring it, i'll make the biggest mic man look like a midget

[Hook]
Don't get big for ur boots & come with a clique full of youts man i'll roll up pistols & shoot & then start (fuckin widda team)
I can hear em still i don't fear em im standing near & Wiley's with Sheeren it don't make sense u (fuckin widda team)
Ever since i was a kid kid kid i'll flip the script sick how a ninja would slip in the bits there's no way you're (fuckin widda team)
& its Skepta pardon my language but this guy needs to eat one pussyclart gunshot sandwich why is he (fuckin widda team)

[Scorcher]
U wanna fuck widda team then buck ur machine cause if i see u on a normal day man
I'll cut thru the jumper & jeans & dig out a lump of ur spleen in front of ur team
I ain't gotta buck widda bean i got a flick knife i'll stick guys
When u let off ur 38 six times & hit nothing, i'll spin back around & cut thru six guys
I've done this once before, i've been involved in guns & war
So listen to K don't fuck widda team cause im so sure i'll buck the 4
& let off the pistol in broad daylight when its crystal like im above the law
So go ahead start (fuckin widda team)...

[Wiley]
Forget fuckin widda team don't chuck it widda team im too big they can't lock him in the scene
I won't get bumped try knock him in the scene think the kid's off guard ain't on green
Im so controversial strong not weak so its on who's on? the remix that u try &
Make a better tune in im superhuman think that im a loser, u keep fuckin widda
Team then you're gonna be the human losing, im an intruder im intruding
When niggas came to the game i was moving 6 years later Wiley's still moving
Tell me who's weighty wanna outdate me when im on form no top boy's cruising
See a spot in the ranks & u move in me i got a spot in the ranks i ain't moving

[Hook]
Don't get big for ur boots & come with a clique full of youts man i'll roll up pistols & shoot & then start (fuckin widda team)
I can hear em still i don't fear em im standing near & Wiley's with Sheeren it don't make sense u (fuckin widda team)
Ever since i was a kid kid kid i'll flip the script sick how a ninja would slip in the bits there's no way you're (fuckin widda team)
& its Skepta pardon my language but this guy needs to eat one pussyclart gunshot sandwich why is he (fuckin widda team)
