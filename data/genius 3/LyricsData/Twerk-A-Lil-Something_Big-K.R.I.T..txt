[Hook x2]

Aye twerk a little something shorty, show a player what you got
After hours at the club will make you drop it like it's hot
You say you can't but you can
Aye do for me what you wouldn't for your man

[Verse 1]

Aye you the best at what you do no matter what it is
Drop it to the floor to make it clap a bit
Aye toss it on a player baby
Imma get her and shorty show me what you got
And know she ain't scared of this
It's live live baby think it's hell
Caramel brown grab her ass whisper in her
It'll tell her turn around (turn around)
Let me see you from the bed
(I) know you like it like that
Got some friends that can roll
Tell them whip it right back
Get in my ride hit the nearest curb store
Grab some rubbers and some drank we can pour up on the go
Imma miss you but whining and dining's out the question
Because you ain't an investment screw you like taxes
You know the game and the plot you done heard my rhymes
I'm not gonna spit all that bullshit typed lines
You know you fine or you wouldn't be in my car
Aye twerk a little something shorty you could be with a star

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]

Yea i'm a southern player give me a bad bitch (a bad bitch)
With her own cash, and a fat ass (a fat ass)
She'll let me beat it every evening until I bust on her
She'll whoop a nigga's ass if you try to touch on her
I know the type fit right with her hair did (got her hair did)
In the end I'll be fucking up a lipstick
Aye this some pimp shit nigga I don't think or doubt it
You ain't a pimp nigga if you got to think about it
Better hand cup her bra when she around G's
Mad because his main lady went and chose me (chose me)
You confused if a bra will ever have a bro
Be like Snoop nowadays
We don't love them hoes (we don't love them hoes)
I would talk much much for the bitch though
I'm still on the try of thoughts you learn from the risks though
You know you fine or you wouldn't be in my car
Aye twerk a little something shorty you could be with a star

[Hook x2]

[Hook x2]

Aye twerk a little something shorty let me see what you got
Twerk a little something shorty let me see what you got
After the club we can chill at my spot
After the club we can chill at my spot

[Hook x2]
Aye toss it on a player baby I'm get her and
Shorty show me what she got and no she ain't scared of it
Aye toss it on a player baby I'm get her and
Shorty show me what she got and no she ain't scared of it

[Hook x2]

It's live live baby think it's hell
Caramel brown grab her ass whisper in her
It'll tell her turn around (turn around)
