[Verse 1]
I hear the words you say
With your twisted tongue
Careless venom
I live caught in your web
There’s a tug on the line
And you eat me alive

[Hook 1]
Tell me how you’re better than I
Why are you so empty inside?
You’ll never ruin me!!

[Verse 2]
Use me as your own device
You beat me down
With your judgments
And I bought what you sold
It cost everything
And it’s left me... alone

[Hook 2]
Tell me how you’re better than I…
Not better! Not better!, NO!
Why are you so empty inside?
You haven’t got a clue!
I’ve wiped my hands of you!
Tell me how you’re better than I…
You’ll never ruin me!!

[Bridge]
You look so innocent
You’re screaming, I’m not listening
YOU’LL NEVER RUIN!
You’ll never ruin me!!
I FEEL! SO MUCH!
TORTURE! FROM YOUR WORDS!
I FEEL! SO MUCH!
TORTURE! FROM YOUR WORDS!

[Verse 3]
Remove the stain of your curse
The trace of your smell is decaying
Discard the weight of the guilt
You’ll find no remorse
You’ll be left hollow

[Hook x2]

[Outro]
I FEEL!
SO MUCH!
TORTURE!
FROM YOUR WORDS!
