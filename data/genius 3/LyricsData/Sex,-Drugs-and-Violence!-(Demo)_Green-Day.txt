All my life trouble follows me
Like a mystery girl
I've been chasing down memories
Like a mystery girl
I've been getting lost searching my soul all around this town
I took a wrong turn at growing up and it's freaking me out

Back at school it never made much sense
And i could pay but i can't attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die, i guess, but thats the way it goes
Sometimes i must regress this

Sex, Drugs and Violence!
English, Math and Science!
Safety in numbers!
Gimme gimme danger!

Well i dont wanna be an imbecile
But Jesus made me that way
All my life I've been runnin' wild like a runaway
Wherever the night takes me like a stowaway

Back at home it never made much sense
And i could pay but i can't attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die, i guess, but thats the way it goes
Sometimes i must regress this

Sex, Drugs and Violence!
English, Math and Science!
Safety in numbers!
Gimme gimme danger!
HEY!

Back at home it never made much sense
And i could pay but i can't attention
Teaching me the hardest lessons of my life
Too dumb to die, i guess, but thats the way it goes
Sometimes i must regress this

Sex, Drugs and Violence!
English, Math and Science!
Safety in numbers!
Gimme gimme danger!
OH!

Sex, Drugs and Violence!
English, Math and Science!
Safety in numbers!
Gimme gimme danger!
WOW!
