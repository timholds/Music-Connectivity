You ...ain't it!
You ...ain't it!

You're the hottest band around
You're the biggest dicks in town
...but you don't mean shit to me
You're everybodys ??
And you got a lot of flatter
But you're not that pure to me
You're everybodys friend
And you dont understand
Why I can be so mean
You think its good
That the ?? knows you
And you hate when im obscene

I dont wanna hear about, about your work
I've heard it all before
I played that song before
Your band is such a bore
Hear(?) about shallow
Down saying it(??)
And it's just so nice
???
Your words don't mean shit to me
They don't fool me

You ...ain't it!
You ...ain't it!

You always sit back
While the girls fight it out
Saying you dont want to get involved
And you just watch while the ??????
But you gotta play a show cuz they love you
You play that song so well
But when somethings wrong
Why can't we all just get along?
It's not your fucking problem..

I don't wanna ??????? about your ?????
You said it all before
You said this once before
Your band is such a bore
And you sit back high
When you dont say a thing
It's just so nice
?????????
But nice dont mean a fucking thing to me
You don't fool me

You ...ain't it!
You ...ain't it..
