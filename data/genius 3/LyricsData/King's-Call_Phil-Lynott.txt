It was a rainy night the night the king went down
Everybody was crying it seemed like sadness had surrounded the town
Me I went to the liquor store
And I bought a bottle of wine and a bottle of gin
I played his records all night
Drinking with a close, close friend

Now some people say that that ain't right
And some people say nothing at all
But even in the darkest of night
You can always hear the king's call
You can always hear the king's call

Well they put him away in Memphis
Six feet beneath the clay
Everybody was crying
Everybody said it was a plain grey day

Me I went to the liquor store
And I bought another bottle of wine and another bottle of gin
I played his records all night
And I got drunk all over again

Now some people say that that ain't right
(That ain't right)
And some people say nothing at all
(I say nothing)
But even in the darkest of night
You could always hear the king's call
You could always hear the king's call

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
And I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you

Now some people say that that ain't right
And some people say nothing at all (I say nothing)
But even in the darkest of night
You could always hear the king's call
You could always hear the king's call
You could always hear the king's call
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing here
They might as well bring the curtain down
I cried the night the king died
