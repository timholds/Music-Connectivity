[Chorus]
And to reflect is to regret throwing it all away
And apathy, my one-way street, it took so much from me
Separated by this divide I created through my fears
And in your tears you tried to show blind eyes and tell deaf ears

[Verse 1]
If we can make it through the landslide standing
We'll lift each other up to see the bliss on the horizon
Been looking in from the outside lately
I've seen who I used to be, and it's not me

[Refrain]
And we can keep healing
And we can keep holding on

[Verse 2]
I just want to take you where our time won't waste anymore
Through the mountains, on the water
We'll stay engulfed in one another
And when I can wake up, to see the sunrise in your eyes
Then we'll finally be free, and I'll know I've made it home

[Interlude]
So let's go out west and bask
In the overcast
And walking through the rain
We'll see the beauty in life again
Life again

[Chorus/Bridge]
And to reflect is to regret throwing it all away
And apathy, my one-way street, it took so much from me
Separated by this divide I created through my fears
And in your tears you tried to show blind eyes and tell deaf ears

[Refrain]
We can keep healing
Oh, I know, we can keep holding on
