Nasty little perv
Nasty as they said you were
Even your wife leaves town on holiday
Just to get away from you

Oh you're horrible and undeserving
Your mac is full of mud and dirt
He knows, that we know he's a nasty little pervert
Does some dirty jobs
(Does his dirty jobs)

Yeah, you were hard to rid of
You're hard to unattatch
Even tried to take my dongle
Oh, but I got my dongle back

The truth is you are undeserving
Oh the things that you type in to search
Oh he knows that we know he's a nasty little pervert
Does some junk jobs
(Does his dirty jobs)

Oh you are so undeserving
Oh the things that you type in to search
Oh he knows, that we know he's a nasty little pervert
Does some dirty jobs

Dig it

I've got my dongle back
I've got my dongle back
I've got my dongle
I've got my dongle
I've got my dongle back

Dongle
Does his dirty jobs
Dongle
Does his dirty jobs
Oh
Dongle
Does his dirty jobs
