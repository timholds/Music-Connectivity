[Verse 1]
Cruising down the boulevard
I thought I saw your face
But it was just a paper dove flying away

[Verse 2]
City lights are flashing by
I'm sober but my mind is high
I'm thinking 'bout the time we flew away

[Chorus]
But if you wanna burn all the bridges on the way
And I don't need you anyway
I don't need you anyway
And it ain't tears, baby, it's just the rain
Falling from the sky in perfect grace

[Verse 3]
Bodies on the dance floor dancing
Cheek to cheek, discoball burning
Smoke filled rooms in, stilled this yearning, babe

[Verse 4]
Looking at the stars, I wonder if you're looking too
If you're all alone or if you got somebody new
If you wanna call me everytime you fall into a haze

[Chorus]
Why'd we have to burn all the bridges on the way?
I don't need you anyway
I don't need you anyway
And it ain't tears, baby, it's just the rain
Falling from the sky in perfect grace

[Bridge]
Do you think about me on the great days?
Never thought that I could miss something so much
But I'm okay
Round one and another one; are you having fun?
Are you having fun?

[Outro]
Well I don't need you anyway
I don't need you anyway
And it ain't tears, baby, it's just the rain
Falling from the sky in perfect grace
Perfect grace
In perfect grace
