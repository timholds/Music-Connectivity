[Verse 1]
On a mission, I made my decision
Lead a path of self-destruction
Slow progression, killing my complexion
And it's rotting out my teeth

[Chorus]
I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want
And that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face

[Verse 2]
Every hour my blood is turning sour
And my pulse is beating out of time
I found a treasure filled with sick pleasure
And it sits on a thick white line

[Chorus]
I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want
And that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face
Say!

[Verse 3]
I'm on a mission, I got no decision
Like a cripple running the rat race
Wish in one hand and shit in the other
And see which one gets filled first

[Chorus]
I'm on a roll, no self-control
I'm blowing off steam with methamphetamine
Well, don't know what I want
And that's all that I've got
And I'm picking scabs off my face
Say!
