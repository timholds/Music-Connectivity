[Verse 1]
I take my licks - like a man
Facing forward
I made my bed, it wasn't yours

How soon we'd forget - what we shared

You said you'd always be mine
I nodded and smiled
Tongue out of my head

[Chorus 1]
Is this love?
Or the love of the chase?
Is this love?

Is this love?
Or the love of the chase?
Tell me now, is it love?

[Verse 2]
We did the best that we can
Across the world
We made a plan, it wasn't yours

How soon we'd forget - what we shared

In folding sands
Our castle, no more
The magic - sleight of hand

[Chorus 2]
Is this lover?
Or the love of the chase?
I had you once, you kept forgetting my name

Is this love?
Or the love of the chase?
What was your name?
Was it something like me, me, me?

[Bridge]
We recede in the fog
As to breathe in this calm
And forget this walk
To leave, you and all
We were more than the fall
And I hope you'd agree
Like sunlight through the fog
Always chasing me

Lil bluebell in shade - what was your name?
Was it something like me?
Lil bluebell in shade
What was your name?
Was it something like me, me, me?

[Chorus 3]
Now, is it love?
Or the love of the chase?
Is it love?

Is it love?
Or the love of the chase?
Is this love?
