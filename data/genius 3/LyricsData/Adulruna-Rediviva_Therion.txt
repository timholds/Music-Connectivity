Shine on me Runa
Rune rediviva, you're reborn at last, from the past

GAGHN MIS

Adulruna
Rediviva
Adulruna
Hear the calling:
"Walk to meet me!
Run to meet me!"

In ancient days
In an ancient world
The Sibyls sung their melodies
But the song is lost, and no one hear
When Sibyls speak the words of gods
The world is deaf!

Ancient Sibylla we will follow you...

Adulruna
Old Sibylla
Hear our calling
Speak to Mankind!

O' Hermes Trismegistos
Orpheus, Zarathustra
Pythagoras and Plato
Mediate the wisdom!

Philosophers eternal
Make the spirit flying
Rising to spheres harmonic
Where Sibyls are still singing

Leo, are you roaring to make the world awake again?
See Sophia
Descending from the sky

Drink the sacred nectar from the rose
The maiden has returned!

The root of mandragora
(is the) foetus of Sibylla
The pages of the Runa
Mediate her message

Sibylla
Sophia
She is born
(the) female Christ
Aphrodite from the sea
(O) sacred rose
Come to me

Come, come
Rise, Rise
Venus Venus

The nectar and the bloodred wine
Intoxicatate, expel the time

O' Hermes Trismegistos
Orpheus, Zarathustra
Pythagoras and Plato
Mediate her message!

Rise O' wise Venus
Rune Rediviva!
