Promise me you will wait for me

One day soon I'll come back
And I'll stay forever more
Wait for me, say you'll wait for me

One day soon we'll wander where we've never walked before
Say to me, you will wait for me

When the winters through, once more I look into your eyes
I will fly to you upon the wings of butterflies

One day soon I'll see you
And I'll kiss away your tears
Promise me, you will wait for me

Say you will, and we'll see every dream come true
Wait for me, wait and I will come back to you
One day soon
