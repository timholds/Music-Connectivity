[Hook 1]
I'm gonna fight 'em off
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back
They're gonna rip it off
Taking their time right behind my back

[Verse 1]
And I'm talking to myself at night
Because I can't forget
Back and forth through my mind
Behind a cigarette

[Bridge 1]
And the message coming from my eyes
Says "Leave it alone"

[Hook 2]
Don't want to hear about it
Every single one's got a story to tell
Everyone knows about it
From the Queen of England to the Hounds of Hell

[Verse 2]
And if I catch it coming back my way
I'm gonna serve it to you
And that ain't what you want to hear
But that's what I'll do

[Bridge 2]
And the feeling coming from my bones
Says "Find a home"

[Hook 3]
I'm going to Wichita
Far from this opera forevermore
I'm gonna work the straw
Make the sweat drip out of every pore

[Verse 3]
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding
Right before the Lord
All the words are gonna bleed from me
And I will think no more

[Bridge 3]
And the stains coming from my blood
Tell me "Go back home"
