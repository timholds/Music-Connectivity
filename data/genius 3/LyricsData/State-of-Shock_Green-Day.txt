I'm going into a state of shock
I can twist, I can hardly walk
And I'm holding on for life
Should I be concerned?

My eyes are rolling in the back of my head
I'm black and blue and I'm in the red
And the silence is so loud
Should I be concerned?

We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
Defy your judgement and demons
And save your last goodbye

My tears are putting out my cigarette
And I'm singing out the alphabet
The way I remember
Should I be concerned?

Make a mess of my amnesia
I'm going under anaesthesia
And I'm holding on for life
Should I be concerned?

We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
Defy your judgement and demons
And save your last goodbye

We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die

We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die

We want to go to heaven
But no one wants to die
Defy your judgement and demons
And save your last goodbye
