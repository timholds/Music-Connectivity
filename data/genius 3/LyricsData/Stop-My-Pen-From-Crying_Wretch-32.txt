[Hook: Wretch 32]
I will not keep silent
But I just really wanna stop my pen from crying
But I don't really wanna end each line with
I just really wanna stop my pen from crying
Things happen so I've gotta keep writing
But I just really wanna stop my pen from crying
And I don't really wanna end each line with
I just really wanna stop my pen from crying

[Verse 1: Wretch 32]
How can I stop my pen from crying
When I put pain in the ink? I'm straining to think
I'm drained, I lay and I wish that those that lay in a ditch
Could play with their kids
I've prayed, I've sinned, I've changed, I think I'm saved within
I bleed creative ink
I breathe books and cry lines
And when my granddad died, my pen cried
And when Georgina got leukaemia
And I looked into my friend's eyes
I'm not playing, cuh God made me
Know exactly how it was for Diddy when he lost Faith
And not a lot's changed, I still don't believe in much
And my gran keeps telling me to keep in touch
And I haven't tried
Cuh since Granddad died
She ain't been feeling loved
And when she goes, I'll be bleeding floods
Lyrically leaking love all over the page, all over again
I can't stop
I'll bleed on beats till my heart stops
And I'm dead meat
But you can't X out the Wretch
Cuh I'll get beats and then cardiac arrest
Becuh death's peak and I can't be arsed to rest
How they test sleep

[Hook: Wretch 32 & Darren B]
Look, if things happen, I will not keep silent
But I just really wanna stop my pen from crying
Look, I don't really wanna end each line with
I just really wanna stop my pen from crying
But things happen so I've gotta keep writing
But I just really wanna stop my pen from crying
Look, I don't really wanna end each line with
I just really wanna stop my pen from crying

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
I tried to stop my pen from crying
And then Janine died
When the car that she was in collided
And she drove to a better place
And I looked in her coffin
So no, I won't ever forget her face
And no, I don't ever forget a face
So I still see Charlene's
Glasses when I can't sleep, it can't be
Half six and I can't dream
I squint my eyes like I think I'm blind
I jump up, then I cry sixteen lines
Can this be right?
Has someone altered my sight
Or am I just haunted for life?
It's unfortunate, alie
And when my mum's mum passed away
I didn't wanna war with my son's mum's arse again
Cuh life's too short to pass the blame
And it's my fault why we don't start again
But it's like you're too quick to use Kyrayn
And he's part of Jermaine
Look, sometimes you should stop and think
Cuh I've been stressed
Since I found out my friend's mum
Just might not have that long to live
So I told him what he told me
Hold your head, be strong and wish
If not for you, fam
Then at least do it for your kids

[Bridge: Wretch 32 & Darren B]
Listen, look, when I write
I shed tears through the pen, they say I cry (they say I'm crying, yeah)
Look, it's like
I'm shedding tears through the pen when I write
Listen, look, when I write
I shed tears through the pen, they say I cry (they say that I'm crying)
Look, it's like
I'm shedding tears through the pen when I write
Listen, when I'm writing
I'm shedding tears through the pen, they say I'm crying (they say I'm crying, yeah)
Look, it's like
I'm shedding tears through the pen when I write

[Hook: Wretch 32 & Darren B]
Look, if things happen, I will not keep silent
But I just really wanna stop my pen from crying
Look, I don't really wanna end each line with
I just really wanna stop my pen from crying
But things happen so I've gotta keep writing
But I just really wanna stop my pen from crying
Look, I don't really wanna end each line with
I just really wanna stop my pen from crying
