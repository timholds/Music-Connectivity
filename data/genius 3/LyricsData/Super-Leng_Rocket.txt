I can't score you out of ten cause I'd get too high
You're way past a ten, super leng, uber peng, too fine
Yeah, welcome round the ends anytime, look
Wouldn't care if you belled off my line, yo

You're way past a ten, super peng, uber leng, too fine
Yeah, welcome round the ends anytime, look
Wouldn't care if you belled off my line, yo

[Verse 1: Scorcher]
You're like a 13/10, 15/12, from 1989
You're just my kind of size, 5' 8", maybe 9"
Your ex wan' beat you up, I just wan' beat you down
You heard man sleep around
But hear what, take this in, it's best that you take a risk
It's rare that I'm in your town
Bare man looking scared, dem man are over-shook
I just wan' pull your hair when I grab your throat
You tun [?] when I backstroke
Thump it up, now your back's broke
No play, I don't fuck round with no friendzone
Touch down, end zone

[Hook: Rocket]
I can't score you out of ten cause I'd get too high
You're way past a ten, super leng, uber peng, too fine
Yeah, welcome round the ends anytime, look
Wouldn't care if you belled off my line, yo
I can't score you out of ten cause I'd get too high
You're way past a ten, super leng, uber peng, too fine
Yeah, welcome round the ends anytime, look
Wouldn't care if you belled off my line, yo

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
She be one-o out of one-o
Ringside, cost me one O for the front row
First round, he got one blow cause he ducked slow, lights out
So we rush home, straight to the head, cutthroat
Left side paralysed, guess I gave one stroke
Caught her throat foaming cause she overdosing, I'm dope
Cocaine, she can't feel her face on the weekday
And she fuck me cause I'm free, I guess I'm a cheap date

[Hook: Rocket]
I can't score you out of ten cause I'd get too high
You're way past a ten, super leng, uber peng, too fine
Yeah, welcome round the ends anytime, look
Wouldn't care if you belled off my line, yo
I can't score you out of ten cause I'd get too high
You're way past a ten, super peng, uber leng, too fine
Yeah, welcome round the ends anytime, look
Wouldn't care if you belled off my line, yo
