[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
Yeah, she so vicious, sweet kisses, taste delicous
Maybe this is who I should make the misses
Let's conversate a little like a fiddle, play with the middle
They way she shake when it wiggle, I mean she hot like a kettle
Well, me I'm strapped with the metal when I go hard for the bread
So I line you up and I dent you, you run you're fucked when I catch you
You only eat cause I let you, I hate the fact that I met you
When you could say that you know me and act like I'm your homie

[Chorus: Missy Elliott]
Touch me, tease me, feel me and caress me
Hold on tight and don't let go, baby, I'm about to explode
Cause all my love you can control

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
She scratch my back when I'm stroking, she scream she like it, she open
I'm sitting back while she sucking, she super freaky, I love it
The sex is better than basic, that kitty kat, yeah, I chase it
She do it just how I like it, position after position
Fast stroke, short stroke, deep stroke, listen
She down for pushing her limits, that's why I'm pushing up in it
Start kissing her lips then I'm kissing her neck
When my tongue cause her tata, bet it get wet to it, easy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Case]
I'll spend the night with you
If you promise you will do
All the things to make me scream
And you know just what I mean
Cause tonight you taste like ice cream
I wanna make you fall in love
Make you touch the stars above
Please me low and be my friend
I'll come back and hit it again
And again, and again, and again
Don't go away

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Foxy Brown]
Let me get that Lex, nigga
Sex wetter than aquariums
Flashing, they get their ass in
Who fucks slow with lear jets and coupes
My ones stacking
You ain't know that I be macking
The extra set of keys, the thirty G's
Them chips, the bellies, had you living on your knees
Not to mention the laced out crib in Dallas
The fourty room palace sipping cristal-ise

[Chorus]
