Now we're all alone
Your parents are gone
And were just about to get it on
Time is so now and mine to sieze
But I'm drumming on my knees
Look at me now am I not slowly leaning in

Oh yeah you can see
What you're doing to me
And I know it's not meant to be easy
But it sure feels right to me now

Tell me star on the wall close my eyes and I'll try
Tell me star on the wall close my eyes
Over and over again for the rest of my life
And right in front of your eyes
My first time

All my friends are gonna see
Your lips are still on me
But I can pay for my sins
I'm like flowers and violins
And now we're all alone
Your parents are still gone
And we're just about to
Get it on

Oh yeah they can see what you been doing to me
And I know it's not meant to be easy
But it feels more than right to me know
Tell me star on the wall close my eyes and I'll try
Tell me star on the wall close my eyes
Over and over again

And for the rest of my life
And right in front of our eyes over and over again
And for the rest of my life
And right in front of your eyes
My first time
