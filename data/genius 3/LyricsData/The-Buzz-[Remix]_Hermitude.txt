[Intro: Mataya]
Do you feel, feel
Feel, feel
Do you feel it in the air?
Do you feel, feel
Do you feel, feel
I can feel it in the air

[Pre-Chorus: Young Tapz]
Do you feel the buzz or is it just me? Trust me
Something in the air, just above me
Something like a dream state
You call it a clean break
Do you feel the buzz, baby?
Do you feel the buzz?

[Verse: Big K.R.I.T.]
I feel it in the air like kush clouds
Stuck to the ceiling, come get me down
Rolled around with eyes tight and all
Slow motion weed, and shit, we had to crawl
Like the lac lac lac  we don't know just how to
Act, act , act when we on this level
All I know is bass, see it in your face
When the 15's knockin' we trippin' on treble
Round and round we go
Lights flash in this atmosphere
When I'm seeing double I get into trouble
But your body like crystal clear
So what's happenin', shawty? Picture perfect
No caption shawty, just askin' shawty
Then get lost tonight
Then wake up like, "What happened, shawty?"
Can you feel?

[Bridge: Mataya]
Do you feel it, do you feel it in the air
Is it just me?
Do you feel it, I can feel it in the air
Is it just me, is it just me?

[Pre-Chorus: Young Tapz]
Do you feel the buzz or is it just me, trust me
Something in the air, it's just above me
Something like a dream state
I can't even see straight
Do you feel the buzz, baby?
Do you feel the buzz?

[Chorus: Young Tapz]
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Do you feel theâ€”
I feel it, baby
I feel it, baby
Do you feel the buzz?

[Outro: Young Tapz]
I said, "Do you feel the buzz?"
Buzz
