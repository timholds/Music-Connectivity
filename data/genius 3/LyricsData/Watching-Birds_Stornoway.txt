Oh well, her eyes they hypnotized like a pair of headlights
And I remember how she crashed headlong into my life
So I said now close those eyes, stick a pin into this map
And then she said now look around because there'll be no looking back
Oh, but I've been looking since that day, since the day we parted
But you don't find happiness when you're searching for it
And I might have realized I was wasting precious time
But I never had the chance to change the batteries in my watch
Oh, and it's a Monday night in June
And I should be sleeping but it's so damn warm inside
I'm in the garden dreaming and I've got one chair for myself
And another for my feet but I still don't feel complete
Well, she calls me every day just to touch base with me
And the birds upon the wire they feel the electricity
And I watch them as they fly
And she lifts me up with them until I fall for her again
Oh, and I've been working since that day, since the day I left her
I'm making money watching birds but I don't feel no richer
And I should have realized I was wasting precious time
But I never had the chance to change the batteries in my watch
Oh, and it's a Monday night in June
And I should be sleeping but it's so damn warm inside
I'm in the garden dreaming and I've got one chair for myself
And another for my feet but I still don't feel complete
