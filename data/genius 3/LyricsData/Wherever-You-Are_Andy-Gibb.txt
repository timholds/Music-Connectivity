There is a beautiful woman , an ordinary guy
You let her into your heart
It's a part of the show but you never know why
You fall in love in a minute and it's a bottomless well
And she'd be draggin' you down 'til you just wanna die
It's a livin' hell

Wherever you go , you live inside of me
I was born to make you see what you never learned
Wherever you are , we'll let the lovin' go down
Lovin' ev'ry minute
The seconds , the hours , that you wait around
What if I like to play but the world gets in the way
Instead of loving you I'm losing you
And losing just don't pay

Somebody give me the night
Give me a chance to feel
I see your face in the sky 
In the moon and the stars
But you know it ain't real
You battle love to the limit
Ah ,but you never can win
You finish up cryin' tears in the

Wild woods but you can't give in
Wherever you are , we'll let the lovin' go down
Lovin' every minute
The seconds , the hours , that you wait around
What if I like to play but the world gets in the way
Instead of loving you , I'm losing you
And losing just don't pay

Wherever you are ,you know the lovin' don't end
And though you make it a crime girl , I love ya
I try to talk to you woman
You got your mind on your own
There may be somebody else in your eyes girl
But you're still alone

Wherever you go my love will follow you
My dream will make it through
If I ever learn

Wherever you are , we'll let the lovin' go down
Loving every minute
The seconds , the hours , that you wait around
What if I like to play but the world gets in the way
Instead of loving you , I'm losing you
And losing just don't pay

Wherever you are , we'll let the lovin' go down
Loving every minute
The seconds , the hours , that you wait around
What if I like to play but the world gets in the way
Instead of loving you , I'm losing you
And losing just don't pay
