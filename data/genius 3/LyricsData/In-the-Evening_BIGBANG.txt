When the evening
Colors everything
And all of the leaves
Turn to gold
From under my tree
I'm just looking
Still don't know what to say
And then there's velvet
On the ground
Who says I'm sleeping?
When I'm still
Still keeping
An eye on you
Who says I'm sleeping
When I'm still?
I'm still keeping
An eye on you
