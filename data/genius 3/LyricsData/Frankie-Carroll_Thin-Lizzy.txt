Frankie Carroll
He got drunk last night
I tried my best to help him
But he wound up in a fight
And his missy got him
She said, "Frankie, it's all right"
"Frankie won't do you wrong"

Frankie Carroll
He beat his kids last night
"I don't like you kids shouting"
"Shut up now, I don't care who's wrong or right"
And his missy got him
She said, "Frankie, I'll keep the kids quiet"
Frankie, Frankie, what's wrong?

Frankie Carroll
He fell to bed last night
And his head hung off of the pillow
And his eyes were closed shut tight
And his missy she got up
And turned out the light
Frankie, Frankie, what's wrong?
