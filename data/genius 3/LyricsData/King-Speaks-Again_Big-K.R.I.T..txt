Personally my nigga, I'm trying to do this shit for the hood, for the streets, my nigga. Ain't never gotta worry about me going commercial man, even when I do make a bumping ass track, them shawdys goona get jiggy to it in the club, I'm still gonna be on some playa ass shit, you get that my nigga?

And I'm just gonna try and do it big for the hometown, for the state, and for the whole coast my nigga because we gotta stay down for each other and that's real talk. Big KRIT shawdy, get it and gone
