[Intro]
Good Evening, it would be uncivilized to bring you this presentation without fair warning
You are about to discover the world of horror
Look no further than one's own mind
To find the very place where demons, even monsters hide
If you wish to vacate the premises please do so now
Well then, you've been warned

[Chorus]
I don't have the heart to hurt you
I don't have a heart at all
Don't you let your feelings steer you
Steer you straight into the wall
If you're still here by tomorrow
I'll forget about your past
She said hold me like the first day
I said fuck me like the last
'Cause you know I'm gone

[Hook]
Die alone, die, die alone
(Possibly)
Die alone, die, die alone
(Probably)
Die alone, die, die alone
(Possibly)
Die alone, die, die alone

[Verse 1]
I stayed away for days and months
Till the pain was numb
You see, I became the one I had to save you from
Everybody wanna tell you what you can't become
But wait, even the Devil was an angel once
I ain't the one, del Toro with a loaded gun
Fear and loathing in the Vegas sun, like it's '71
You said I'm better when I'm sober, that's when we conflicted
I was never sober around you, you couldn't see the difference
I told her maybe I'm just mad at myself
I think thats why I love everything that's bad for my health
Why am I dying to see Heaven when I was happy with Hell?
Somebody take this pack of shells and put em' back on the shelf (I mean)
Insomnia turn me into a zombie
I'm coming for all the moments they rob me of
Now it's obvious, since you made it a hobby of watching us
I be popping up, and copping all my ops binoculars like it's the opera, ugh!

[Chorus]
I don't have the heart to hurt you
I don't have a heart at all
Don't you let your feelings steer you
Steer you straight into the wall
Cause you know I'm gone

[Hook]
Die alone, die, die alone
(Possibly)
Die alone, die, die alone
(Probably)
Die alone, die, die alone
(Possibly)
Die alone, die, die alone
