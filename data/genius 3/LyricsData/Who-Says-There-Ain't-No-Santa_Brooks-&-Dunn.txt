Got a wife and two kids, all gathered around
A twenty-pound turkey, snow on the ground
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus
Eric wants a glove, he tears into a box
His eyes are wide with wonder
I sit back and watch
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus

I haven't heard a single reindeer running on my roof
I just look into my children's eyes
And there I see my proof
And could it be that jolly old man riding in his sleigh
Is really just the kid in us on every Christmas Day
Who says there's no Santa Claus

Molly gets a doll, Momma's camera clicks
Guess we all get the puppy, he's getting in his licks
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus

I'm trying to read a card in crooked red and blue
Only part that really matters is "Daddy, we love you"
Who says there ain't no Santa Claus

I haven't heard a single reindeer running on my roof
I just look into my children's eyes
And there I see my proof
And could it be that jolly old man riding in his sleigh
Is really just the kid in us on every Christmas Day
Who says there's no Santa Claus

Hey, I've heard there ain't no Santa Claus
But I know there's got to be a Santa Claus
