[Verse 1:Reba McEntire]
If you see him
Tell him I wish him well
How am I doin'?
Well, sometimes is hard to tell

[Pre-Chorus 1:Reba McEntire]
I still miss him more than ever
But please don't say a word

[Chorus:Reba McEntire]
If you see him
If you see him

[Verse 2:Ronnie Dunn]
If you see her
Tell her I'm doin' fine
And if you want to
Say that I think of her from time to time

[Pre-Chorus 2:Ronnie Dunn]
Ask her if she ever wonders
Where we both went wrong

[Chorus:Ronnie Dunn]
If you see her
If you see her

[Bridge:Ronnie Dunn + Reba McEntire + Together]
Oh, I still want her
And I still need him so
Oh, I don't know why we let each other go

[Verse 3:Ronnie Dunn + Reba McEntire]
If you see her
Tell her the lights still on for her
Nothin's changed
Deep down the fire still burns for him

[Pre-Chorus 3:Together]
And even if it takes forever
Say I'll still be here

[Chorus:Ronnie Dunn + Reba McEntire]
If you see him
If you see her
If you see him
If you see her
