[Intro: Zion.T]
One damage
Machine gun
Shooting through you all
Machine gun
Dudududu, dudududu
Machine gun
Dudududu, dudududu
It smells like chemicals
Them bitches tryna copy my shit
Copy my shit
(Ooh)
Y’all ready

Machine gun, machine gun
Machine gun
Machine gun, machine gun
Machine gun
The coolest, machine gun
Dudududu, machine gun
I told you mo’fuckers

[Verse 1: Zion.T]
West Side, Seoul City
This is my playground, Seoul City
Look there, those retards, how disgusting
I laugh at you all
My sunglasses are so fucking black, blackholes
My studio is my weapon
And I hold two pistols in my hands
Put away your firecrackers before I hit you in the head
Whatever I touch explodes, boom

[Hook: KUSH]
A bullet to your head
A bullet to your chest
A bullet to your ear
Machine gun, machine gun
Machine gun

A bullet to your head
A bullet to your head
A bullet to your chest
A bullet to your ear
Machine gun, machine gun
Machine gun

[Verse 2: Mino]
(uh uh, yeah)
Long time no see
I’ve been really busy until now
So busy that I haven’t rested
I’ve added commas in my bank account
X-E-L-O-R I’m in a hurry
I put my watch on backwards
Wait a second, I won’t be in Korea during the weekend
So don’t look for me (ey!)
If you don’t like how a bastard who sings mainstream music raps
Block your ears
No, actually
Just don’t meet your friends
Because they’ll talk about me, close your mouth
No, actually
Lie in your blankets
Bite into snacks and turn on the TV comfortably
And when you happen to turn on Mnet, you’ll see me
The moment you get pissed off, add some hate comments
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Kush, Kush, baby, MINO, Zion.T
We got three guns
Your heads are targets, click
A treason that has unfolded
In the middle of Seoul city, bitch
Bow your heads into cochleas, RIP
Dudududu, our engine noise
Bureureureung, like a jet plane
On the other hand, yours’ are
Search engines (Google Google)
It’s raining outside, drip drip
Us three walk
On top of those rainclouds
We look like
The cloud walker, Son Wukong
We eat Senzu Beans
Dududu

[KUSH]
I don’t have an ID
I go loco
If you want my photo, tranquilo
Don’t whine
Papico

[Mino]
Get excited/aroused in front of women
Amigo

[Hook: KUSH]
A bullet to your head
A bullet to your chest
A bullet to your ear
Machine gun, machine gun
Machine gun

A bullet to your head
A bullet to your head
A bullet to your chest
A bullet to your ear
Machine gun, machine gun
Machine gun

A bullet to your head
A bullet to your chest
A bullet to your ear
Machine gun, machine gun
Machine gun

A bullet to your head
A bullet to your head
A bullet to your chest
A bullet to your ear
Machine gun, machine gun
Machine gun
