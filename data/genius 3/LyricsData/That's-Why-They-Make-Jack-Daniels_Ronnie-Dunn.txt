[Verse 1]
Some memories never fade
Some broken hearts just stay that way
Some dreams just aren't meant to be
But you keep, holdin' on, long after she's gone

[Chorus]
That's why they make Jack Daniels
Two fingers in a glass
It ain't gonna make it any better
But, it won't hurt as bad

[Verse 2]
Some scars time won't heal
Some goodbyes that you're still gonna feel
Some ghost just keeps comin' back, from the past
And it won't, ever let you move on

[Chorus]
That's why they make Jack Daniels
Two fingers in a glass
It ain't gonna make it any better
But, it won't hurt as bad

[Verse 3]
Some nights just never end
Sometimes I need to forgive you again

[Chorus]
That's why they make Jack Daniels
Two fingers in a glass
It ain't gonna make it any better
But, it won't hurt as bad

[Outro]
It ain't gonna make it any better
But, it won't hurt as bad
