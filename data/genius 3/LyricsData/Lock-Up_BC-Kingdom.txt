[Verse 1]
Give me 100 bullets
And I'll use them correctly
I'll kill you
I'll do it in Versace
Behind my tears I look for you
You waiting and infidel
I tried to love you, babe
But I always deemed, to fail

[Hook]
That's why I go to jail
Lock up my heart around you
That's why I go to jail
Lock up my heart around you

[Verse 2]
I'll use my golden gun
Because one shots kills
It's thrilling
Yes, I'll play Tuesday a while
Let you bleed, like I bleed
So many tears I cried
For you, I try to stop
But I couldn't
And I know
That I wouldn't
No, no, stop loving you

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Call 911 [x2]
Try to get alone with you (Call 911)
But you broke my heart in two [x2]

[Hook]
