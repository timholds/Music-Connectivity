Oh listen to me girl
As I take the time
To tell you how I feel, yeah yeah
In spite of what you feel
You really need to know, my love for you is real
For everything you've done, to hurt me in the past
I'll forgive you, yes I will
Just know that I'm still in love with you
Baby I'm still...

Said I'm still in love with you
In spite of the things that you put me through
Said I'm still in love with you
