[Intro: Amy Millan]
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

[Hook: Amy Millan]
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

[Verse 1: Madeon]
I could never find the right way to tell you
Have you noticed I've been gone?
'Cause I left behind the home that you made me
But I will carry it along

[Chorus: Madeon]
And it's a long way forward, so trust in me
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone

[Hook: Amy Millan]
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

[Verse 2: Madeon]
When I'm older, I'll be silent beside you
I know words won't be enough
And they won't need to know our names or our faces
But they will carry on for us

[Chorus: Madeon]
And it's a long way forward, so trust in me
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone

[Hook: Amy Millan]
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder
Ayy, I will, ayy
Ayy, I will, ahh
Ayy, I will, ayy
I wonder, I wonder, I wonder, I wonder

[Outro: Madeon]
Oh it's a long way forward, trust in me
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until...
