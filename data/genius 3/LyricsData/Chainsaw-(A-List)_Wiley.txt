[Hook]
Louder, ye coming in loud
Louder, to the up turning ground
Open up the cloud, everybody bounce
In this way for us, right across the earth
But, murder is the key that I drop
No fear it won't stop
I'm about to turn the gap over
If you feel it in your gut
Kick it down, fuck it up
Turn it up, louder

[Verse 1]
Yo niggas, a couple of winners might give you time
I get to the finish line and rest out the thumb
No I don't keep second to none
Had to help wish I could
Let you go by sit I would
A reckless time to cook this meal
Word up, I'm a young distance
Word up, know that I'm a persistent murderer
I could be just like this no over
See my findings, see my family
Now my sister got to unleash the river
Backpack on my back
Snapback up on my
Headback time to go back on my head
Get away when mom won't be dead
And I'm really on my way

[Hook]
Louder, ye coming in loud
Louder, to the up turning ground
Open up the crowd, everybody bounce
In this way for us, right across the earth
But, murder is the key that I drop
No fear it won't stop
I'm about to turn the gap over
If you're feeling in your gut
Kick it down, fuck it up
Turn it up, louder

[Verse 2]
Hold up, wait wait
I'm late put the goal up straight
Whoever talk basic wins it
I ain't got a problem, marksman shooter
Can't get into my margin ruler
Run to it in this team you ain't cooler
Distinguish air with some more though
And I ain't talkin men you're so curious
But add spice to things it's all normal
I subtract the team gonna mess
I just might snipe your team come out fresh
If you don't ride for me come out less
But now you don't like me 'cause I left
I never did left though
Ross did never did dream or ever did seen
Or resembleing of a pistol
I till stay on top of the test score

[Hook]
Louder, ye coming in loud
Louder, to the up turning ground
Open up the crowd, everybody bounce
In this way for us, right across the earth
But, murder is the key that I drop
No fear it won't stop
I'm about to turn the gap over
If you're feeling in your gut
Kick it down, fuck it up
Turn it up, louder

[Verse 3]
The hard work paying off ye
I'm seeing a lot
Time's awake me while I'm praying to God
If I'm getting one then I'm staying up drunk
I a solo to ages and a mop
Got 4 wounds tonight that's a plus
So them wanna put me down like I'm a dog
And then change your minds when you see 'em got smoke
And I got knowledge of black taxi drivers
Got I'm up still make figures like porch
Grew out in a day, jay lodge
I got fresh haircut no budget
I stay away from barbers that touch
When I roll in the crowd I feel odd
'Cause I been there already I was a old school bud
Gonna use brand new stairs and a mic
Have fuck with the light on

[Hook]
Louder, ye coming in loud
Louder, to the up turning ground
Open up the crowd, everybody bounce
In this way for us, right across the earth
But, murder is the key that I drop
No fear it won't stop
I'm about to turn the gap over
If you're feeling in your gut
Kick it down, fuck it up
Turn it up, louder
