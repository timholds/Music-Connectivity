Down a little winding trail in old Wyoming
To a little shack with roses 'round the door
There's a little blue-eyed curly headed maiden
That I've been longing just to see once more

She's as sweet as the lily of the valley
And you can bet she's all the world to me
We met down in the hills of old Wyoming 
It was there she gave her little heart to me

Now ev'ry night we'll stroll beneath the stars up above
And let the bright silv'ry moon-beams smile on our love
Hand in hand down that little old trail we'll wander
Where the songbirds in the treetops sweetly sing
Then we'll plan and name the day that you'll be mine dear
When your hand will wear a little golden ring

As the twilight softly falls each night she's waiting
'Mid the roses by the old garden gate
Underneath her bonnet golden curls hanging
A smile so bright and cheery on her face

Down beside a little babb'ling brook we'll wander
'Neath summer skies where all the world is still
'Till once again it's time to say, "Goodnight dear
I'll be with you when the sun sets on the hill."
