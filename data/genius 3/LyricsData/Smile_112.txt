(Q)
Another night and it seems that
You made you cry yourself to sleep
Reminiscing on how it began
You found pleasure in this man

(Slim)
You fell like you'll never leave
For his life now you wanna lead
Give me just one chance
Cause I can believe that I can make you smile

(Hook - Slim)
I know a thousand times
You sit alone and cry
You don't deserve it
Cause I can believe that I can make you smile

(Mike)

Any day will it ever cease?

Cause I know how make it right

(Daron)

Cause I can believe that I can make you smile
