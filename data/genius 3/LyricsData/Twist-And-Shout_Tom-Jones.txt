Shake it up, baby, now
Twist and shout
Come on, baby
Work it on out

You know you look so good (twist and shout)
You know you look so fine (twist and shout)
You know you got me goin' now (twist and shout)
Just like I knew that you would (twist and shout)

Shake it up, baby
Twist and shout
Well, come on, baby
Work it all out

You know you twist to go (twist and shout)
You know you twist so fine (twist and shout)
You know you got me goin' now (twist and shout)
And let me know that you're mine (twist and shout)

Shake it up, baby, now
Twist and shout
Oh, come on, baby
Work it on out

You know you look to go (twist and shout)
You know you look so fine (twist and shout)
You know you got me goin' now (twist and shout)
Just like I knew that you would (twist and shout)
Just like I knew that you would (twist and shout)
Just like I knew that you would (twist and shout)
