I know what it's like
To be here all alone
And I can't question these things
They are what I believe

I can't remember
I can't explain
Can't tell the difference
This pleasure and pain
Is my confession a cure or disease?

If wishes were horses
If wishes were horses
Horseless I'd be

I am more than a smile
There's more than that to me
And I don't know what I'll find
Or like what I'll see

I can't remember
I can't explain
Can't tell the difference
Pleasure and pain
Is my confession a cure or disease?

If wishes were horses
If wishes were horses
If wishes were horses
Horseless I'd be
