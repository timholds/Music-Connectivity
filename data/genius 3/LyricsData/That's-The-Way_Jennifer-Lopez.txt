[Verse 1]
I know you see me watching
Although you're trying to play it
Like you don't
When I know you do
You've got the every want thing
That kind of every need thing
You're what I want
So come give it up
Yeah I won't stop until I get what I want
So what am I to do
Because what I want is you
Baby, stop and think
What you and I could be
Together I know we
Can be perfectly complete

[Chorus]
Baby, I can give you anything
If you promise to be with me
I promise I can make you happy
That's the way our love should be
No one could love you better anyway
You'll never find another close to me
I promise I can make you happy
And that's the way our love should be

[Verse 2]
Why are you trying to deny
Me of the loving that's mine
Just let it go
Let me take control
Boy, I got just what you want
And all the love you need
Once you grab a hold
You won't let me go
I won't stop until I get what I want
So what am I to do
Because what I want is you
Baby, stop and think
What you and I could be
Together I know we
Can be perfectly complete

[Chorus] [x 2]

[Bridge]
If I let my actions speak
I guarantee you believe
How much I really do love you
If I could spend my whole life
Just looking into your eyes
I'll be happy just knowing you're with me

[Chorus]
