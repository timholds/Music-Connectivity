Yeah

[Hook]
My criminal mind is all I
All I've ever had
Ask [?]
Might be so bad

[Verse 1]
Yeah
I can take you to the real top
She took the elevator up till her ears pop
Tell these motherfuckers pray I got a clear shot
Killing shit I should have a face full of tear drops
Okay
I'm high on myself
But you should prolly know I'm also high on everything else
I'm throwing singles at these bitches I guess anything helps
Im playing eenie miney mo with the medicine shelf
A little chemical help from a criminal self
I keep a sinner with me you would think I rent her from hell
She's a motherfucking devil in an innocent shell
See they fuck you for the fame when they want you to fail
It's okay
I had enough love
Bring that shit around here and get her fucked up
I called it tough love
Put my dick through her heart and tell her fuck love

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Hey
My goodness is sounding like greatness
But I keep getting overpowered by the fake shit
Fuck names I barely recognize faces
And hoes still comfortable around me like vegas
All the lights
Call that life
They can tell I shine brightest on the darkest nights
Start shit
Sorta like
How I'm in the fucking booth but I'm on a flight
I don't fuck with none of ya not a single one of ya
Take your spot from under ya while you take the summer off
I make the money backflip summersault
Watch me kick game kick game past summer ya
Okay
I had enough love
Bring that shit around here and get her fucked up
Yeah this is tough love
Put my dick through her heart and tell her fuck love (what)

[Hook]
