Happiness for misery (I want it)
Cut me up and leave me (for dead)
Sacrifice a simple life (no return)
Kiss the wife and kids goodbye (for good)

Come on, beat me
I'm not a man
Go on and kill me
Condemned

Use me as a chemical (I'm burning)
Love me like a suicide (commit)
Treat me like an animal (I like it)
Put me on my leash again (your pet)
Suck the soul right out of me (don't need it)
Happiness for misery (the end)

Come on, beat me
I'm not a man
Go on and kill me
