[Verse 1]
Forgiving him was the first thing I had to to
In order to move on
Forgetting it was not as easy to do
I had to teach myself to be strong
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how it made me feel
The bad and the good sometime I wish I can take it back
But we can't go back gotta keep moving

[Refrain]
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how it made me feel
The bad and the good
Sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back
Gotta keep moving

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all good, don't wanna hear no woulda coulda
Maybe I shoulda
Stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good now that I'm going for what
Now that I'm growing now that I knowing

[Chorus]
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Never gonna give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I have to admit
You weren't the only one at fault
I was at wrong too
Trying to be someone I knew that I wasn't
I thought I can make myself happy with you

[Refrain]
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how it made me feel
The bad and the good
Sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back
Gotta keep moving

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all good, don't wanna hear no woulda coulda
Maybe I shoulda
Stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good now that I'm going for what
Now that I'm growing now that I knowing

[Chorus]
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Never gonna give up, give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
I knew I was gonna get through it
Breaking up is hard to do, but I had to do it
Time has something to do with me figuring it out
What this is all about
When it came to me, when it comes to me
Gotta do what's best for me

[Pre-Chorus]
It's all good, don't wanna hear no woulda coulda
Maybe I shoulda
Stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good now that I'm going for what
Now that I'm growing now that I knowing

[Chorus]
Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Never gonna give up, give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Never gonna give up, give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Never gonna give up, give up
Never gonna give up on love
