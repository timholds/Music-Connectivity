[Verse 1]
I saw they could lie from the start
But Sam, I'm just playing my part
I'm a pawn like they say nothing more
But Sam, I promise I ain't nobodies whore
We could move to Rome or somewhere like that
Oh Sam what do you think of that

[Chorus]
I wanna find a soul in a land that's died
A soul in a land that's turning brown, wasting time
Can't look them in the eye as I'm walking home
To you cause they know what I have done, what I have done

[Verse 2]
We could buy us a car one of those ones
Like straight from the Bruce Springsteen songs
Are they sold here at the bottom of the world
Or are they just for American girls
What about Sam, have you ever been there?
I heard there's jobs for dancing girls everywhere

[Chorus]
I wanna find a soul in a land that's died
A soul in a land that's turning brown, wasting time
Can't look them in the eye as I'm walking home
To you cause they know what I have done, what I have done

[Outro]
Oh Sam, Oh Sam, I ain't working there no more
Oh Sam, Oh Sam, the stage ain't for me no more
Oh Sam, Oh Sam, I can't stand their eyes no more
Oh Sam, Oh Sam, I know I ain't the first one
