[Intro- Lupita Nyong'o]
Okay
Mmmm
1, 2, check it

[Verse- Lupita Nyong'o]
Mexican-born, Kenya runnin' through mah veins
Dark chocolate, plus I keep a sharp mane
Lanc√¥me fresh face, looking tailor made
Disney on the books so you know I stay paid
Next stop Katwe, rockin' out with David
Don't do critics, if you hating please save it
Ambassador for elephants, try'na save the planet
I'm working on mah master plan, stuntin' in a hammock
Buggin' out wit' Robyn Hood, Wilson's all day
Some play to eat, but we eat to play
Speak four languages, doin' deals in Spanish
Hit 'em with my autograph, poof, I vanish
Onto to the next, Panther. Rest, civilian
Shout out to the villages, hit 3 million!

[Outro- Lupita Nyong'o]
UH! Yeah!
Uh! Uh! Yeah!
(Lupita giggles)
