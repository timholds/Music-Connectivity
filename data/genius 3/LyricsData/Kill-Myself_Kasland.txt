[Verse 1]
I promise after this song I'll never do this again
But you had it coming to you and you knew this was when
I needed you the most, but all you do is pretend
Or maybe I just happen to be the rudest of men
Feel like I'm new to this pen as the ink bleeds on this pad
Cause I don't talk a lot of shit unless Sleezy's gone mad
Never was shit yet I'm already a has been
And this ain't Sleezy talking by the way this is Kasland
Now you got me spazzing keep pulling me down
I believed you all these times, but no more fooling me now
Don't try pulling me down, I'm far too heated
I have you a reason to hate me and that's all you needed

[Hook]
Sometimes I just want to kill myself
Take me away from my family, friends, and everyone else
All the stress and all the pain
It's got me depressed and I'm going insane

[Verse 2]
How can a grown ass man, with no last stand
Be filled with so much anger that there's no Kasland
Oh yeah, that's right, cause he's got no friends
And his people thinks he's nothing but a fuck up and
They take his self esteem, pride, and light from the end
Fuck it you can even take this mic from my hand
And I'll just fight with this pen as I walk into the darkness
The devil's in his cradle and I'm rocking it its hardest
There's nothing you can do to me, cut me open shoot at me
Cut my fucking head off, but we both know I'm soon to be
Another dead fucker going straight to hell
And I'm locked behind the stress, but I payed my bail

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Shit if Imma leave this bitch then I'm taking you with me
Cause there's no way in hell I'm fucking going out empty
Don't tempt me, cause I'm the type to pop something off
Do a headcount line them up and then I'm chopping them off
So don't be acting like you're really about to make something happen
Better listen while I'm rapping to you fakes I won't have it
I'm about to go rabid start foaming at the mouth
Drop the fucking mic and start really blowing up the south
If you show a rough amount of stress for me to take on
Imma run in blasting off like it won't even take long
Fuck the pressure, go ahead and bring the fame on
And if you're feeling how I'm feeling we can sing the same song

[Hook]
