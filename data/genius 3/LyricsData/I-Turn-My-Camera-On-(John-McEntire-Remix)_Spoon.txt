I turn my camera on
I cut my fingers on the way, on the way
The way I'm slippin' away
I turn my feelings off
You made me untouchable for life, yeah
(Keep on blowin' up, keep on blowin' 'em off)
And you wasn't polite
It hit me like a Tom
You hit me like a Tom
On, on, on and on, yeah
Well, I turn my feelings on
I turn my feelings on inside, yeah, yeah
(Keep up, roll it out, keep up, turn it out)
Like I'm gonna ignite
I saw them stars go off
I saw them stars go off at night, yeah, yeah
(Keep on blowin' up, keep on blowin' 'em off)
And they're lookin' alright
(Keep on blowin' up, keep on blowin' 'em off)
(Get up roll it out, keep on showin' 'round)
It hit me like a Tom
You hit me like a Tom
Hit me like a Tom
It hit me like a Tom
Keep on blowin' up, keep on blowin' 'em off
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It hit me like a Tom
Hit me like a Tom
Hit me like a Tom
It hit me
Here comes the flan
Hit me like a Tom
It hit me like a Tom
Hit me like a Tom
