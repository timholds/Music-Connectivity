[Straight bars: Big KRIT]
Play it all cautious, still a little nauseous
Burnt in or broke I gotta get this shit off me
Rather not talk about it, like who cares?
I'm just a narrator of the song, it's you there
Close your eyes and imagine, lifestyle flashing
Without the headaches stash boxes and a mansion
Something like heaven I guess we all could say
Any time could be your last, I guess we all should pray
Love ain't easy I guess we all should hate
On the next man when the best man won the race
Like he ain't work as hard as you to get by
Congratulate and accept the fact it's his time
But we poor though, I understand your pain
It ain't about win or lose but how you play this game
Somethings I wish I never ever did
Sacrifice a lot just to be on this field
A little more blood shed than there was tears
Might of cried once or twice but that was in between the years
Probably in the bathroom looking in the mirror
Trying to see what my Grandma see in me I can't figure
Money, hoes, and drugs she don't know what I'm doin'
I ain't came up for shit but tell her I'm movin'
I ain't did a song in months but tell her I'm booming
To keep from breaking her heart and causing confusion
Leave it all here she gon' listen to my music
My father know what's up he just acting all clueless
Truth is, she oblivious to the fact
When I tell her I'll be home soon I'm never coming back
Unless I'm in a drop top coupe or a casket
Cuz I'm tired of borrowing but more tired of asking
Crashing, hundred miles per hour head on
Either write about the life you live or dead wrong
Politic with God like "I ain't doing so well"
Scared the good I done don't exempt me from Hell
Seen so many fell, victim to the streets
How could I care when I was like better them than me?
But that's just how you feel when the struggle is so real
You ain't ate your own meal your homeboy got killed
And he was still a child, damn its hard to smile
I been a bitter son I ain't prayed in a while
Truth is, it's hard out here
