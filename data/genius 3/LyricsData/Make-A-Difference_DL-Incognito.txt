[Verse 1: DL Incognito]
So many tracks, so many tours, so many very late nights
They say I'm nice, but far from living up to the hype
I pen my life, to me my paper trail is alright
But outta sight is outta mind, being bright don't make you shine
These lyrics don't get you dimes like nines and crimes do
Rhymes won't get you signed like walls in bathrooms
I got dudes that did dirt, we all love, we all hurt
I must die, to give birth, to this stone cold world
I'm first generation Haitian mixed with the French
I'm in the course to be the boss, no dollars, no cents
Workin men, workin hard, for the man, can't pay rent
Do you want food on the table, or a cinnamon Benz?
I say that's not what hip-hop represents, this past tense
Gotta recoup, pick off on every Jada advance
Wanna be a million strong, like the army of ants
It was destined, not chance, that I'm leading this band
And this love, not romance, that put a ring on her hand
And when I dance, the music got me trapped in a trance
And when I go, I'll finally see my mommy again
Yo in the heavens, I miss you mommy, 24-7

[Chorus: I'm here to make a difference
I'm here to make a difference.]

[Verse 2: DL Incognito]
How can I speak gibberish, when I live this, so vivid
My story's not from rags to riches, its of persistence
Chosen to go the distance, never needed assistance
Enter without permission, I overstay my welcome
It's so seldom is a rapper of my caliber created
Once in a blue moon, yet the audience is jaded
Oblivious to greatness, till I exit the stage and
The void that I leave can't be filled by any patron
With life's education, a love affair with music
Ya'll know what my point of view is, but my records are useless
Too much time spent on this topic, so dear to my heart
I think not, I'm wishin I could press restart
Cause the blind leadin the blind, gotta hold me some laws
I'll take your mind back by force, and order's restored
My vocal chords are used for more than just bravado
Rip from vinyl to Cerrado with 40's and crackin' bottles
There are no role models, it's up to the parents
To teach their kids to understand the music they're hearin
Cuz hip-hop was created, for social awareness
You don't want what happened in Paris to take place here

[Chorus]
