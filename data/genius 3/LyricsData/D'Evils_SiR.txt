[Chorus-Sample]
One spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away

[Verse 1]
Tell me who that nigga if it ain't me
If it ain't a party, then it's finna be
Never had a problem that I couldn't solve
It must be official, if I get involved
Quarter pound of fire burnin' daily
Harder to remember, gettin' harder to remember
I've been through enough to drive me crazy
I don't think my mama's gonna save me

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm not flyin', but I'm floatin'
If we're not headed to the top, where we goin'?
Two miles-an-hour, can you picture me rollin'?
'Cause life is so much better when you live in slow motion

[Chorus-Sample]
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
(Slow motion)
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away

[Verse 2]
Pardon me while I elevate
May not be on time, but I'm never late
Blazin' like the player that you wanna be
Flavor like your baby mama cup of tea
You see the company I'm keepin' now
Feelin' like I'm dreamin', I keep feelin' like I'm dreamin'
Don't come around if you don't be around
I been the man you believe me now

[Bridge]
Maybe I'm not flyin', but I'm floatin'
If we're not headed to the top, where we goin'?
Two miles an hour, can you picture me rollin'?
'Cause life is so much better when you live in slow motion

[Chorus-Sample]
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
(Slow motion)
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
My one spliff a day'll keep the evil away
