[Hook]
Uh, yeah
I said it won’t be long (no)
‘fore we out here baby
Gotta get you up out here baby
Said it won’t be long
‘fore we out here baby
We up out here baby

[J. Cole Verse 1]
I say a prayer and look up in the sky
Thank God even though a nigga headed to this tired day job
Will my eyes stay wide still I know I’m gonna blow
This is music for my niggas cause I know you want more
Cause that old shit fake but this new shit real
J. Cole not Jay but this that Blueprint feel
Hey Cole is you crazy that's some big boots to fill
Yeah straight out the Ville and the shoes fit well
Seen heaven, seen hell, seen niggas get killed
Knew every detail still never would tell
Scared of the repercussion, scared of them people bussin'
Bullets be hittin’ nigga’s you swear they could be percussion
Niggas be holding triggers before they could read instructions
Oh God, never did our fathers teach us nothing
No law, but became a man on my own
Showed my momma I could stand on my own

[Hook]

[J. Cole Verse 2]
Dear mama, your son hurting
Living in this cold World where niggas shun virgins
And praise hoes
As days go by shawty 19 years old
No clothes for her baby yet she stay so fly
Tell me why mamma do you cry
Is it cause you know my teacher be feeding me lies
Is it cause you know that Preacher is greedy inside
Cause racism is alive I see the disguise
Mamma I know it hurts
It hurts me to watch you go to work barely hanging on
Some rich man getting richer while you slaving for him
So whats the options for him
A young nigga from the hood without a pops at home
Surrounded by no good
And soon no good becomes so good quick
A little drug money got him feeling so hood rich
Killing your hood with the same shit Ronald Reagon filled up your hood with
And it’s still in your hood shit
I’m feeling no good mamma
I’m sick of my soul
Is there a better life for us I just sit and I hope
I just hope and I pray
It’ll change one day I’ll make a change one way
And mamma I can fly you out this cold world
This cold life, it’s all wrong
There’s no right
Its hard to see the good when there’s no light
Just grab onto me, trust me hold tight!

[Hook]
