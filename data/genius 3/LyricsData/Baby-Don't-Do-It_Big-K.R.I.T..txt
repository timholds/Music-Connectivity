Yeah shawty I know I made some mistakes
To get ya back I do whatever it takes
Yeah shawty I know I made some mistakes
To get ya back I do whatever it takes
Don't do it, don't give a nigga up like that
Don't do it, don't give a nigga up like that
I was gon' get right back
I was gon' get right back

[Verse 1]
I did you wrong I hurt your heart and I apologize
Wish I was [?] cuz I can see with no other guy
I wouldn't have left them other hoes alone if I didn't care
Last night I came home and you wan't there
I blame myself for all the tears that you cry shawty
I did this music cuz I knew that you would ride shawty
We talked all about the tour dates and pre-shows
You said you wouldn't be concerned with all them groupie hoes
But then you start trippin' fighting with me actin' funny paranoid thinkin that you seen me with another woman
I though you didn't trust me so I made a grave mistake
I met up with a shawty that I knew around the way
But now it's too late, yeah and the damage done
The weight [?] do you wrong is on my shoulders and it weighs a ton
But I can't take it back but what we had I can't lose it
I'm crying out just like this track baby don't do it

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I tried my best did my best wasn't good enough
3 years shawty why the hell you givin' up
You're mamma told me that you cry 'bout it every night
Friends remind me when they see me that I wasn't right
You never miss something good till it's gone
Without you in my life girl this house ain't a home
This music ain't in me and the money ain't worth it
When it was me and you we were oh so perfect
Ay this is real, this is now, this is how i'm feeling
No worries, just chilling thats how we be living
But now the shits twisted
And yee ain't gettin' back
I threw away what we had but I can get it back
And all you need is time
And imma be around
I'm only human and I'm sorry that I let you down
But I can't take it back, but what we had I can't lose it
I'm crying out just like this track baby don't do it
