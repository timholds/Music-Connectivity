[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
All day girl, I had you on my mind
And I'm thinking 'bout maybe later me and you can spend some time
And you can help me spend my money, me and you can feel alive
And let's forget about the world cause baby, it's just you and I, I, I

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let's get crazy, alright, come on, let's go, oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go, oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go, oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's

[Verse 2: will.i.am]
Dancing on the dance floor, girl it's you I adore
Step off stage, I scream for more, my native trunk got love galore
Snap my fingers, make you mine, if not, I snap a second time
After that I guarantee you will be standing next to me
My baby, baby, baby, you're sexy, drive me crazy
I feel like I've been blazing, puffing purple hazing
Well girl, this love is natural, forever undetachable
So, what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown & will.i.am]
Let's go, what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?
Let's go, what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?
Let's go, what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?
What you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let's get crazy, alright, come on, let's go, oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go, oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go, oh
Crazy, alright, come on, let's go, let's go
You gotta, you gotta get get get crazy, get get get crazy, you gotta, you gotta get get get crazy

[Verse 3: will.i.am]
Love you like my boom-box, make me wanna moon walk
No, this ain't no old love, Lamborghini countach
Mrs. Maseratti, hop inside my Bugatti
Girl, I'mma make you mine, hot damn you fine, I want your body
I want, I want, I want you, love me, damn, why don't you?
Girl, this ain't no puppy love, grown man shit, no youngster
I would love to touch you, I ain't tryna rush you
But what you waiting for, what you waiting for, what you waiting for?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Let's get crazy, let's get crazy
Let's get crazy, let's get crazy
Let's go, let's go
Let's go

[Verse 1]
