[Verse 1]
Let’s get looney like Mr. Bugs Bunny
Go on and shake your ass with Mr. Loves Money
Tell me that you’re young hun I really like your bun buns
Mr. K. Sleezy has a thing for the young ones
Let’s dance away the night girl it might go slow, it might go fast
I like to watch you dance girl cause I really like your ass
I take a wild guess why every girl calls me psychopath
Maybe it’s cause I like to wear lipstick on my Michael mask
So come on girl pucker up for Ms. Myers
I don’t diss rappers baby girl I diss liars
The ones who like to say that they’re all about the music
When they’re all about the money and they’re fake I just lose it
Guards in the asylum turn on a tight beat
Cause they know I start dancing and I can’t control my feet
I start to shake my booty and I start getting hot
That’s how Mr. K. Sleezy ends up getting caught

[Hook]
This beat right here makes me want to shake my booty
Just get up and dance I don’t mean to sound fruity
Come on girl don’t act like a nooby
Stand up with me and let’s get looney

[Verse 2]
You can keep your pants on, Imma take my pants off
We don’t have to dance long, we’ll just have a dance off
Once you play the damn song, I can take my hands off
My butt cheeks and I let them clap ‘til I can’t cough
I got some jiggy in my system and my butt won’t stop
Get on your knees little slut don’t talk
What the hell are you doing, get your hands off my zipper
I just said get on your knees so I can feel bigger
Look security guards while I’m jamming on camera
Rocking out big like Hannah Montana
Feeling like a pop star, flashy like a cop’s car
Healing crazy minds that rely on me like OnStar
Damn baby girl I think I’m starting to feel hungry
Go pick me up some sushi and get it with your money
I’d get it myself, but there is no chance in
Hell that I can get myself to stop dancing

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I crank that Soulja Boy while I try to sip pop
Put the can up to my lips, but then a drip drop
Everybody always want to say shit talk
I think superman’s here to save hip hop
But I could be wrong though it wouldn’t be the first time
Like when I got yelled at for making up that nurse rhyme
I think it kinda went a little something like this
What, you thought I was actually gon’ tell you?
Going crazy in my cell getting wild and tearing sheets
I’ll kick you in the forehead while I’m wearing cleats
Leave you with a bruise the size of D. Prince
I think I just made a fat joke, gee wiz
Kids look up to me like I belong on Nick Junior
Parents sick of Dora I can make you sick sooner
Want to see a magic trick (ok)
I can make your kid disappear (no wait)

[Hook]
