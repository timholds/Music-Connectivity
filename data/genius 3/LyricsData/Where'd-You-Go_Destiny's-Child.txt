[Intro: LaTavia]
Oh, baby, where'd you go?
I need you back wit' me
Oh, baby, where'd you go?
I need you back wit' me, uh

Where'd you go? (Where'd you go?)
Where'd you go? Oh no
(So, baby, please come back to me)

[Verse: Beyoncé]
It has been five days
You haven't called me
Do you still want me?
Still need me?
Am I on your mind?
Are you thinking of me?
Are you missing me like I miss you?
Crying constantly
Runnin' out the reasons
Why I haven't heard from you, I'm worried
Got me doin' crazy things
I can't even sleep
Gotta get you back to me

[Chorus:]
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you

[Verse: Beyoncé]
Thinking of everything
That you told me
Said you'd never leave me, deceive me
Got my mind thrown off
Did you just use me?
Boy, you confused me
Gonna lose me
I can't deal with all the pain
And hell you put me through
Cause I'm still missing you
Wanna be wit' you
Without you here, I'm breaking down inside
Oh, baby, tell me why
Why did you hurt me, hurt me?

[Chorus:]
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you

[Breakdown:]
(Destiny's Child, help me out)
It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me
It's my destiny to have you here with me

[Chorus until fade:]
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
So, baby, please come back to me
I know I can't live my life without you
Where'd you go? I don't know
I know that I need you in this heart of mine
