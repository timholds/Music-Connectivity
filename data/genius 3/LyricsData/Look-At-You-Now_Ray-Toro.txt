[Verse 1]
The times we spend feels like so much wasted
No need to pretend, It's all a little crazy
A fallen grace, a stain that won’t come clean
If only I choose to believe
 
[Pre-Chorus]
All the wars that you’ve fought 
Now for how long?
You lived through it all
Look at you now
 
[Chorus]
You stood up for yourself
I can’t count how long
You lived through it all
Look at you now
Look at you now
 
[Verse 2]
I feel insane
Seems like the world’s gone crazy
We'll meet in the end
Please God, won’t someone save me
Tears that bathe an angel’s dirty wings
If only I choose to believe
 
[Pre-Chorus]
All the wars that you’ve fought 
Now for how long?
You lived through it all
Look at you now
 
[Chorus]
You stood up for yourself
I can’t count how long
You lived through it all
Look at you now
Look at you now
 
Show the world you won’t give in
Look at you now
Show the world you want to win
Look at you now
 
Look at you now
