Lately I've been living days and days
Not long ago I heard you on the radio
Put you in my stereo
But I don't know
And though you really weren't born that long ago
I just wanna see you I just wanna see who you are
Like what I'm seeing so far

And if you really wanna know who I am
Well I'm just a little man
You can turn me into a bigger man that's how I am
And if you wanna spend some time with me some time
Well I just wanna know you I just wanna see who you are
Like what I'm seeing so far

I'm not a Muddy Waters
I'm not a Rolling Stone
But I'm the boy child coming over to your house
And we're gonna have a lot of fun

Dudududududu

Call me you need me
You got something good you shouldn't keep it to yourself
I'll please you I'll tease you
And you don't need to worry about anybody else

I'm not a Muddy Waters
I'm not a Rolling Stone
But I'm the boy child coming over to your house
And we're gonna have a lot of fun

Dudududududu

And now the sun's coming up
Let the bottom of your cup go down

The sun's coming up
Let the bottom of your cup go down
