Freedom
We still find it hard to believe that you're gone
We still find it hard to believe what you've done
If we only knew what you had on your mind
If we could only find a way to talk to you just one more
Time
You've made the hardest choice someone could ever make
You took the hardest step someone could ever take
Brother what you did it hurts us all inside
We'll never understand why you just had to die
Why did you have to die?
We still can't believe you left us so suddenly
We still can't believe you became a memory
Oh it's so hard, so hard to lose you friend
Way to fast your life came to an end
Where ever you are now we hope you're finally free
A brother to us all is what you always be
We still can't believe you left us so suddenly
We still can't believe you became a memory
Our lives will go on although it's without you
But your spirit will remain in everything we do
In everything we do
