Ay!
What's happenin' shorty?
You listenin' to the sounds of Willie Hutch
And your boy Big KRIT, its goin' down
Pimpin' at its finest
Shawty

(Verse 1)

(Hook)
It's money outchea, you better know that
You gotta grind til you shine, never hold back
It's money outchea, what shawty so high
You better work what you got til it blow high
It's money outchea, and what you no good
From the high mount top, down to your hood
It's money outchea, you better get some
Your mouthpiece don't work, you better get one
It's money outchea

(Verse 2)

(Hook)
