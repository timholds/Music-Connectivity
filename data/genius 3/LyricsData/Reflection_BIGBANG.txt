Was it all worth waiting for
When you came home late one night
Was it all worth waiting for
It was always out of sight
But once upon a time
When we were doing fine
We were all together
Hiding under sheets
Or laughing in the streets
We were something better

But now I see the reflection of my face
Running down your cheekbone
I see the reflection of my face
Running down your cheekbone

Trying to make the best of the situation
Trying to make you feel alright
My little moves all around you
In the darkness or in the light
We had a place to go
In fifty years or so
We would be getting older
Driving in the rain
We slowly felt the pain
We were just growing colder
