You're standing on the only chair
And you're singing to the screens and the moving stairs
All on your own in the arrivals
You heard it in the watchman's cry
And you saw it in the bleeding evening sky
You got a Swiss army in your pocket
'Cause here comes the blackout
Now the hooded snake controls your mind
It stole your eye on the 7th of July
We've got to learn to love our neighbor
Before our neighbor starts scaring the love out of us
Before they frighten the love out of us
In the story of the matchstick girl
She was freezing on the streets of Petersburg
She lit a match and found a warmer world
But here comes the blackout
Now the hooded snake controls your mind
It stole your eye on the 7th of July
We've got to learn to love our neighbor
Before our neighbor starts scaring the love out
The hooded snake controls your mind
It stole your eye
So now we've got to learn to love our neighbor
Before our neighbor starts scaring the love out of us, out of us
