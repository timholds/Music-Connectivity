[Verse 1]
She looked so good moving across the dance floor
Better than the day she left me
Arm in arm with somebody new
Holding hands and laughing like we used to
I got my best smile on, but it's no disguise
It don't hide the pain in these eyes

[Chorus]
I did her so wrong, for so long
Turned my back on her love, now she's long gone
I did my part, to break her heart
She walked out on me, and tore my world apart
She used to be mine
Oh, she used to be mine

[Verse 2]
It's taken every bit of strength that I have
To keep a hurt look off of my face
I can't keep from looking back over my shoulder
At the lucky man taking my place
Oh, if it weren't for my pride, I'd probably take off running
Guess what I'm feeling, is what I got coming

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Oh, she used to be mine
She used to be mine
