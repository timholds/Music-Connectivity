[Verse 1]
Taking away the fact that I care about you, it's just your way
So sweet, everything seems right around you
Did you know that you had this common way about you
When you touch
And I want to know if I could be your girl

[Pre-Chorus]
The one put her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you (Your girl)
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else is, I could see it (Your girl)

[Chorus 1]
The one who knows when it's under control
The one who know your favourite song (Your girl)
The one you when you're feeling lost
The one you place no one above

[Verse 2]
I'm happy to say in a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile when you said you were glad the day you
Found me
I'm wishing away any hope I might ever find you
Heaven knows
I really feel I'll always be your girl

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Break]
Your girl...your girl...your girl
I just want to be (The one who's true to you)
I just want to be (The one who makes you smile)
I just want to be (The one who holds you down)
Your girl...your girl...your girl (Your girl)

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2] [x4]

[Outro]
I can be anything you need
