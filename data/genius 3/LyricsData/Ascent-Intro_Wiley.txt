[Verse 1]
When I stepped in the scene I was always
Gonna get achievement to my whole ways
I fought music everyday all day
Flew out to UK, got a blank CD
Sheep from a traveller
Bitch I was stable
Here we go man never on the table
I've came a long way for my plain cheese bagel
Used to go big real quick any time of the week
Have you got to be livin it to speak it
Have you got in it if you peeking
Have you gotta be awake when every one is sleeping
Getting double I was in no sleep
Get my CD to solo it's lonely
But then again I'm like nobody owes me
To lead or to cry tryin all key
I don't get into what don't involve me
I ain't nosey

[Verse 2]
Time flies when you wanna help everybody
Turn around now look at your anybody
Turn it round don't look I'm a somebody
One spirit, one brain, one body
One heart, one ending, one start
Skips a beat when you hear a gun spark
Our safety's never been an option
That's why we took the other option
Only have a side of the lower back
This scar only have a side on my draw
Couldn't lead me astray, based in a cage
My time is a healer
Erase the waste , erase the bad vibe
I ain't perfect but I'm not bad man
Every dog has a day
That's why I ain't frontin'
Like I never had money

[Verse 3]
Respectful how I was raised
You ain't gotta sing my praise
I know the Lord awaits me
So let me live for the rest of my days
Guide the lost in the journey
I told him once he never heard me
I was like them hard headed
Can't be living off all my past merits
Respectful how I was raised
You ain't gotta sing my praise
I know the Lord awaits me
So let me live for the rest of my days
Guide the lost in the journey
I told him once he never heard me
I was like them hard headed
Can't be living off all my past merits
