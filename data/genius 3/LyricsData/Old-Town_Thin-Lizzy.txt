The old covent garden
I remeber only too well

The girl's a fool
She broke the rule
She hurt him hard
This time you will break down
She's lost his trust
And so she must
All is lost
The system has broke down

Romance has broke down
This boy is crackin up
This boy has broke down

She plays it hard, she plays it tough
But that's enough, the love is over
Shes broke his heart and that is rough
But in the end you'll soon recover

The romance is over
This boy is crackin up
This boy has broken down
This boy is crackin up
This boy has broke down

I've been spending my money
In the old town
It's not the same honey
When you're not around
I've been spending my time
In the old town
I sure miss you honey
Now you're not around
Now you're not around
This old town

Ola, Ola

This boy is crackin up
This boy has broken down
This boy is crackin up
This boy has broke down (x3)
