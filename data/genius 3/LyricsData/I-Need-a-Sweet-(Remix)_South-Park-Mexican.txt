[South Park Mexican {*dialing*}]
Man, let me call this boy, man
Hey, your boy doing bad

[Juan Gotti] Dope House Records
[SPM] What up, Gotti
Say man, I need a ride to the weed house man
[Juan Gotti] Fa sho', homeboy, I'll be right there

[South Park Mexican]
I need a sweet
With short red hair
And when a sweet
I need to be there
I need a sweet
Hear what I say
A killer sweet
To get me through the day

[Verse 1: South Park Mexican]
I need a sweet
So I can blow
A forty dollar sweet
Full of indo
I got a buzz
Uh hun, that's why I does
I put diamonds on my daughter's hairbrush
In this times
Of hate and pain
We need a remedy
To get us out the rain
Jealousy
A little greed
I been thinking
Of what I need
Purple leaves
With crystal flakes
If it's not hydro, please get that out my face
Two-twenty five for a half of O-Z
In the club, with my homeboy Joey T
My science project was in the school arena
Cause I made a bong out this old steam cleaner
Ya mon

Chorus: South Park Mexican
I need a sweet
With short red hair
And when a sweet
I need to be there
I need a sweet
Hear what I say
A killer sweet
To get me through the day
Help me out
I need a sweet
I really do
I need a sweet
Can I smoke a few
I need a sweet
To get me right
I need a sweet
Everyday and everynight

"Mr. Shadow..."

(Verse 2)
{South Park Mexican in background}
[Mr. Shadow] It's uh, 4:20
Time to get high (High)
Choke til I'm gone all day and all night (Night)
Doing what I'm doin' when I'm cruisin' around
It's Mr. Shadow from Diego and I'm holding it down
We blazing a pound, from the west side, down to the south
Three buds, no seeds, that's what I'm talkin' about
We smoke cal til ya black out
I'm in the zone and I don't wanna come back out
Hell nah
Let's all get, high
Fly through the, sky
I want a super red hair with green eyes
Til I die, I'm a get my smoke on
And write a song when I'm hittin' a bong
All day long
Ain't nothin' wrong with that
And if you ever wanna chill, better bring a sack
It's like that
You'll get high off contact
Don't ever let me catch ya dippin' in my chrome bat {Come on, Beesh}
[Baby Bash] I need an
S to the W, double E, T
If you smoke with Baby Beesh, don't tell the police
Cause I'm on that paper, mayn, that's wrong
Cal with a sweet and fat O-zone
If you want that dope
I got a boat load
While my girl got my baby momma in a chokehold
Smoke til my eyes turn Japaneese
Me and Carlos lit half-a-tree
Now I don't pimp
A jigalow
I blow big indo with my niggaros
Gotta mouth full of cotton cause I'm off green butter
Marijuana, mayn, I love her
[SPM] This some good ass weed, Beesh
[Baby Bash] Ain't it, though?
I will not think they'll play this on the radio
I hope so, I need to pay my rent
Now split that sweet down the middle, pimp

Repeat Chorus

[South Park Mexican]
Man, that was some good ass weed, bro
I'm feeling good
Uh hun, my name is Los
Uh hun, I'm feeling good

{*Juan Gotti and SPM laughing*}
[Juan Gotti] You a fool, nigga
[SPM] Yeah, I'll take me to that next dimension, homie
[Juan Gotti] Aight, yeah
