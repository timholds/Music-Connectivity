Let's go out and make the road shake
I got love to make
And I've gotta leave in the morning light
Got a book to write

Leather bound in my feathered hand
To make you understand
To make you understand
That its jus for now
It's just for now

20 years on a steady slope
I'm all out of hope
Never thought we'd come this far
No matter where you are
Oh I'm telling you that when I go
There's something you should know

There's one thing you should know

That it's just for now
It's just for now
It's just for now, hey
It's just for now

Ohoooh

It's just for now, hey
It's just for now, heeey
It's just for now

Ohoooh
