Aren't you gonna come 'cause you wanna come
Won't you come play
Won't you come play

Yeah I got a little somethin' I want you to play with
And it ain't a little somethin' I usually give away
You see I'm looking for a new one to join my band
I promise you'll have lots of fun
Once you take it in your hand

What a gentle sound what a pretty little sound
When you shake it all around
It's making me move 'cause you know just what to do
You're the best I've ever had
What a lovely sound what a sexy little sound
It'll never let you down
'Cause I know that you can make it scream...Ow!

My tambourine
Won't you come and play
My tambourine
Cradle it in your palm
My tambourine
Now get down on your knees and play
My tambourine

Now I see you wanna keep on playing the same old tune
So you better come to practice to learn something new
And if your looking for somebody who'll guide you through
Then you already met your match
'Cause honey I can shake it, too

What a gentle sound what a pretty little sound
When I shake it all around
It's making you move 'cause I know just what to do
I'm the best you've ever found
What a lovely sound what a sexy little sound
It'll never let you down
'Cause I know that I can make it scream...Ow!

My tambourine
Won't you come and play
My tambourine
Cradle it in your palm
My tambourine
Now get down on your knees and play
My tambourine

If you want to come and play
You better be on your way
'Cause it'll be here waiting
And if you want to maybe stay
You know that it's okay
'Cause it'll keep on playing

What a gentle sound what a pretty little sound
When you shake it all around
It's makin' me move 'cause you know just what to do
You're the best I've ever found
What a lovely sound what a sexy little sound
It'll never let you down
'Cause I know that you can make it scream
Because I know that you can make it scream
Oh yeah...
Oh, I wonder how you make it scream...Ow!

My tambourine
Won't you come and play
My tambourine
Cradle it in your palm
My tambourine
Now get down on your knees and play
My tambourine

Aren't you gonna come 'cause you wanna come
Won't you come play
Won't you come play
Won't you come play

My tambourine
