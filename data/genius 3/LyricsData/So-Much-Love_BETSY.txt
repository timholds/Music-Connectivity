[Verse 1]
I've been wanting to test your soul
'Cause your intentions seem so clear
So I wade into the deep
Thereâ€™s no reflections here

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can hardly feel your presence
Your breath on my skin
So far and so distant
Darling don't you know how I need you
To kiss you, to hold and to feel you

[Chorus]
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, got so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, got so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart

[Verse 2]
No need to stand and hide
In the shadows of life
With the sky up above us
And you got to let me in
Let me heal all the scars
Take the dark that surrounds us

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Tell me what you want to know
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I can make it
Tell me what you want to know
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you want to do

[Chorus]
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, got so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, got so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart

[Bridge]
I can make it
I can make it
I can make it true if you want me to
I can make it
I can make it
I can make it true if you want me to
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, got so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, got so much love in my heart

[Chorus]
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, got so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, got so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, got so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart

[Outro]
Oh, so much love in my heart
Oh, got so much love in my heart
Oh, so much love in my heart
