Comin' down the mountain
One of many children
Everybody held their own opinion
Everybody held their own opinion
Holding it back
It hurts so bad
Jumping out of my flesh
And I said

Cash in!

Cash in now, honey
Cash in now
Cash in now, baby
Cash in now, honey
Cash in, miss Smith
Cash in now, baby

I was coming down the mountain
I met a child, man, she had pin eyes
We had the same opinion
We had the same opinion
She was holding it back
It hurt so bad
Jumping out of my flesh
And I said

You better cash in!

Cash in now, honey
Cash in now
Cash in now, baby
Cash in now, honey
Cash in, miss Smith
Cash in now, baby

Woo-oo whoa whoa whoa yeah
