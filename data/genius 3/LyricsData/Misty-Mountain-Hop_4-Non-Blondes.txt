Walkin' in the park just the other day, baby
What do ya what do you think I saw?
Crowds of people sittin' on the grass with flowers in their hair said
"Hey Man, do you wanna score?"
And you know how it is
I really don't know what time it was, woh, oh, oh
So I asked them if I could stay awhile yeah, yeah, yeah

I didn't notice but it had got very dark and I was really
I was really out of my mind
Just then a policeman stepped up to me and asked us, said
"Please, hey, would we care to all get in line? Get in line!"
Well, you know, they asked us to stay for tea and have some fun oh, oh, oh
He said that his friends would all drop by, ooh
Oooo, oooo, ooooo

Why don't you take a good look at yourself and describe what you see
And baby, baby, baby, do you like it?
There you sit, sitting spare like a book on a shelf rustin'
Ah, not trying to fight it
You really don't care if they're coming oh, oh, oh
I know that it's all a state of mind

If you go down in the streets today, baby, you better
You better open your eyes WOAH WOAH YEAH
Folk down there really don't care, really don't care, don't care, really don't
Which, which way the pressure lies
So I've decided what I'm gonna do now
So I'm packing my bags for the Misty Mountains
Where the spirits go now
Over the hills where the spirits fly
I really don't know
