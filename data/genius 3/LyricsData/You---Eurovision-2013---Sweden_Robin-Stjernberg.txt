Hey, do you remember
How we would stay up all night
Talking bout a destiny
And I play the piano, and you would strum on your guitar
Those were the days

If only you could see me now, I live my dream; I owe it all to you
I owe it to you ooo
Isnt it crazy, yeah Isnt it crazy
Its all because of you ooo, all because of you ooo

Its all because of you ooo, all because of you ooo
I know that if the sky would fall I survived it all
Because of you ooo

I reach for the horizon
Whenever I get days of doubt, bringing me down
So even if disaster strikes I close my eyes and then Im next to you
Im right there with you oooo, hey
Yeah isnt it crazy, yeah isnt it crazy
Its all because of you ooo, all because of you ooo
Its all because of you ooo, all because of you ooo
I know that if the sky would fall I survived it all
Because of you ooo

Its all cause of you, because of you, because of you
Its all cause of you aaaahhh
I know that if the sky would fall I survived it all
Because of you oo aaahh
I know that if the sky would fall I survived it all
Because of you ooo aahh
(yeah, yeah(wailing))
