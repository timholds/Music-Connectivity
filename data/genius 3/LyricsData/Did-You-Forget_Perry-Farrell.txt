How can
They fall
For
Their lies?
How
Can they fall (can they fall)
For
Their lies?
Acting
Like the blood that flows
Into you heart is so sweet
Truer
Is the sap that flows
In the veins of a tree

Did you forget?
That's who you are!
It's already been written down in
The stars
And passed on from a father to
His son
It's the time set aside for a holiday
Oh beware and be wise

Gold is
Just dust
Still is
Richer
Than a
Mountain of clay
No matter how they deny it

Did you forget?
That is who you are!
It's already been written down in
The stars
And passed on from a father to
His son
It's the time set aside for a holiday
Oh beware and be wise

Did you forget?
That's who you are!
(That's who you are!)
(That's who you are!)
(That's who you are!)
(That's who you are!)
