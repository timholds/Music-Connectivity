*Beatboxing intro*

CHORUS [Solitair] {Choclair ad-libs}
All I need in this world is you
{yo, one ah one, yo one ah one}
All I need in this world is you

[Choclair]
I was single with plenty women
Half were plenty chicken
Can't waste a holla on a
Squeezing for dollars, so I'm
Spending my time up in these clubs, then I
Met this dark skin girl, now I'm
Spending late nights up on the phone (phone)
Now she's spending the night
Moved in my home, I think... *echoed*
{Solitair} All I need in this world is you

[Choclair]
Yo, now we
Sittin' pretty with our views of the city
Got condos in the clouds
To watch the sun tip its hat (tip its hat yo)
Then she brings it back (brings it back)
We laughed at Bernie Mac (Bernie Mac)
There's nothing better than flying without trying
Cannons, they blazing, on sex engagements
Girls hear the sparkin'
Like "he's off the market"
But some scurry, just to make that girl worry
But girl don't worry
You're my Memoirs, Blake Sav, track six
Don't worry 'bout these flighty girls tactics
I'll tell ya

CHORUS [Solitair] {Choclair ad-libs}
All I need in this world is you
{Yo, I got you on my mind girl, rocking the world, all
Of the time yo}
All I need in this world is you
{It ain't all blue skies, and cake walks}

[Choclair]
Now this girl was, just a young buck
Her Mom's a mess, everynight at the clubs
Her pops is missing, who's her mom kissing?
Now she's a teen, now she's "wookin' pa' nub"
So she's all up in these clubs, at fifteen dollar a pop
She met this dude, that got her to listen
She's getting him cash, she's thinking it's love
Cause she never had, thinking it's bought
Cause he got her some pants
Now wishes she's taught
That ass is just ass
Cause she was just ass, and never expected
That she would get pregant, now in the system she's caught
"Mama!" she cried, "Why are you leading me lost?"
You created a path, I had no choice to walk
All I needed was guidance, you chose yourself
Now my life is imbalanced, but my daughter's my strength

CHORUS [Solitair] {Choclair ad-libs}
All I need in this world is you
{I need you, yeah, that's what these girls cry}
All I need in this world is you
{Music, all I need is music, music}

[Choclair]
In '95 you heard it, my music I worked it
In '99 made Canadians nervous (yo, what you going do dog)
But, thirty day gold debut
But, the picture is bigger
Though it brought me the cash, yo
That was my catalyst, to bring you some bigger shit
Raisin' the bar, constatly we are
Over at the bar, straight raisin' the glass
Draining the pockets, that's what music got us
And Circle rocks it, it eases the soul
Calms the home, collects the doe
Cause it's an entrepreneur
Just like my girl so I got to pursue her
So when I'm 88, my life is great
Yeah, my grandson's like grandad, I want a song
So here's a note and a pad, yo kick it pops

CHORUS [Solitair] {Choclair ad-libs}
All I need in this world is you
{Yo, it's music, it's music, Solitair we got hit
Another one}
All I need in this world is you
{Yo Solitair, kick it}
All I need in this world is you
{Family, first, all that other shit after}
All I need in this world is you
{Choclair, woo}
All I need in this world is you
All I need in this world is you
