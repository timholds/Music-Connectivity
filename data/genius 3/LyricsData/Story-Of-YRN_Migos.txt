[Verse 1: Quavo]
This the story of a young rich nigga
They shot at my momma house I know they had angels with em'
(Not my momma)
I swear to God this the story of a young rich nigga had to juug and kick doors for a living
My heart so cold and its in the middle
Ain't nobody gave me nothing last I remember
You want me to front you some boy you a trap pretender
You weren't with me in them houses kicking in them buildings
You weren't with me juggin' them ounces by myself I did it
You ain't with me in the booth right now while I'm making the millions
Graduated from the kitchen
Niggas hating fuck your feelings
I'm in arenas like I'm Rondo
Came a long way from the bando

[Verse 2: Takeoff]
Let me tell you bout my life lil nigga
Cross my heart I hope to die don't tell no lie lil nigga
You can walk a mile in my shoes young nigga
If 12 interrogate you, you gon' fall I see it in him
Droppin' my top and my windows can't fuck with you niggas you niggas beginners
[?]
Pull up in the coupe they be like that's him
Takeoff on everything made a 100 bought a Porsche last year
Wilt Chamberlain Julius Erving money jumping out the gym
Young rich nigga thats how we live
My nigga double cupping muddy trouble for real
And I ain't no Iron man but I keep that steel
My niggas licensed to kill
Call of Duty damn go for real

[Verse 3: Offset]
This the story of a young rich nigga
Now these bitches go crazy over me they want a picture
I'm tired of these goofy ass nigga not taking no selfie nigga
Where the fuck did you go when the young nigga needed some help my nigga
Kicking doors was the only way to go
You got a devil inside you
Get the gold that's the goal
They treated me like I was hoe
ATF in my dope
Is Mr. Offset at home?
Momma told the nigga no
We really live by the code
Heavy choppers on the road
[?]
After the show I'm grippin' my 40
We made it Grandma told me
I really know that I was chosen
My life was a roller-coaster
Look at my wrist and it's frozen
Look at my neck and it's golden
