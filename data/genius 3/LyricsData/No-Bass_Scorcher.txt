[Scorcher- Verse 1]

Yeah, I'm on tunes with no bass
When the war's on I watch no face, and you know this
I'm on tunes with no bass
When the war's on I watch no face, and you know this
I'm on tunes with no bass
When the war's on I watch, yeah yeah
Ah fuck it let go of me man, let of me man, shit

Listen, some big gunshot man'll aim at your head top
Clap something make half of your head drop
Fuck legshots man are firing headshots
Them man are carrying blanks, man are carrying lead shots
Still wanna act headstrong
Lift man off the floor when he comes down he'll be like wheres half of my head gone
Wheres half of my friends gone
Some big shotgun man'll aim at your head side
Clap something that'll make half of your head slide
Duppy man off at the hospital bedside
They're on legshots, man are on a head vibe
I'll pump the pump up spin around and pop the ting then dump shots at the next guy
Big shotgun pressed on your left eye
Make a move you're a dead guy

(Pause)

I bust a .45 and clap buttons off shirts
Fuck rebores manaman got straps that work
Clap one in your neck make your forehead jerk
Listen, and I don't wanna see you in circa
Tuck you in quick like a shirt on a berk
Keep chatting bout captain, but your name ain't Kirk
Cos I'm on firing guns that you hold with two hands
Shotgun lift man over two vans
Fuck leg shots manaman have got new plans
Open a boys head top like soup cans
Don't go against me, it don't make no sense like driving a car on two bans
This miss you is not an issue if you cme here with a pistol
I'm on firing guns that you hold two handed
Lift man off the spot where he's standing
No, you will not get away with a bandage
If bullets was teeth I'd leave three in the side of your face like a sandwich
I flash the mash quick like a camera but it's not candid, uh
Yeah come off the bad boy poses
When I kick off it won't be thumps in noses
Man carry big heavy metal like guns n roses
I'll open your chest like it's the red sea and my butterfly knife was Moses
And I ain't in Boy Better Know but boy better know this
I'm on a badman ting and you notice
And you notice you're getting too big for your boots
Call my name would you want but I still wouldn't give two hoots
So don't confuse me with none of them youts
I will fling man off of the roof with no parachute
Keep your mouth on mute, it will not be tings in boots
I might move to a man with tings in suits
You can't test my crew, know why
For I will come into your manor with my tool
Taliban style, firing a big rifle
With Badu, Mensa, Johnson, Ross and Jermaine plus lengman Micheal
Clap a man with a gun bigger than the top of the tank then walk off quite cool
You know I ain't no talker
Swear down none of youths want it with Scorcher
You might step out of your house wake up in hosptital holding your head top corner
Laying next to your daugher
With a bowl full of fruit and a jug full of water
With one or two cards saying 'get well, star'
But if I get shift then pray I don't get bail, star
Yeah I'm from north London where the mandem shower
Push big whips just like Max Power
On top of the game like the Eiffel tower
Got a bag of work like bakers flour
I'll have the whole box done in the hour
You take 24 just like Jack Bauer
You're not doing this ting it will just be for nothing like a boy called Martin Fowler
I lick ???? shots like a fouler
And I got skill but I won't go round ya
Blud you can't play with me I might foul ya
I'm the boss like Bowzer
I walk with the shower ting tucked inside of my trouser
Man will lock off the dance and I ain't talking about salsa
I bounce man around like man say I'm a bouncer

Yeah
