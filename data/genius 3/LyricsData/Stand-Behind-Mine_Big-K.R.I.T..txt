I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
This is why I be so fragile (X4)
I'm trynna beat life cuz I can't beat death

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]

Your chariot awaits, now that your on time you'll never be as safe when you was late
Some extend love, but most will show hate
To a dreamer of freedom that chose his own fate
I never lost face in the eye of the Lord
Did what I could with a shield and a sword
A mic with no cord, hammer like Thor
Screamed from my gut they can't fight us no more
A world at war, rich against poor
Look to the sky util my eyes get sore
Be fearful of things just could be in store
When the guns are drawn and the trumpets roar

[Hook: Jay-Z]

I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
This is why I be so fragile (X4)
I'm trynna beat life cuz I can't beat death

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Everything that you put in, the things that you did that you swore on a stack of Bibles, you wouldn't
But you've tooken so much bull shit when it was time to take it all down, you couldn't
The glamour of the world got you all these girls
Your lies and your flow bring you all that dough
Your ice on your neck is nowhere near that cold
To chill the heat of hell when its on your soul
Its even harder dear Father, to be David
When Goaliths so much larger
Then the stone that we gonna
But I'll fight like its no tomorrow, because

[Hook: Jay-Z]

I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
This is why I be so fragile (X4)
I'm trynna beat life cuz I can't beat death

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]

Okay, a rich man's pride is a poor man's pain
Keep what you kill its an unfair game
Some see success end the all stress
A car with you crib is all you get at best
A closet fulla fresh, according to the streets
But its all bull shit, between you and me
Friends turn foes because they want your life
Cuz ya 7:45 in a G5 flight
But how could ya blame em?
You promised you wouldn't leave them
In the same place ya came from
They like money must of changed him
You like money must of changed them
Re-arranged them
But

[Hook: Jay-Z]

I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
I stand behind mine, everything I do I'mma man behind mine
This is why I be so fragile (X4)
I'm trynna beat life cuz I can't beat death
