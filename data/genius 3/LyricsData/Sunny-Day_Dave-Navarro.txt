It's a sunny day outside
Lovely sunny day outside
Happy butterfly outside
I'm locked up inside
I don't know if I can hear another tale of how amazing you can be
I don't know if I can hear another tale of how amazing you can be

Such a lovely day outside
Fairies waiting
Birds are flying in the sky
Office meeting
Perfect temperature outside
Let's go swimming
Freezing deep inside

I don't know if I can hear another tale of how amazing you can be
I don't think that I have really ever seen just how amazing you can be

I met some friends of mine
I used to call them friends
One of them was not so hairy
One of them was not so scary
I ran into a girl I knew before I was on TV
She stopped to get my number
Cause she said that she was glad to see me

I don't think that I have really ever seen just how amazing you can be
I don't think that I have really ever seen just how amazing you can be
