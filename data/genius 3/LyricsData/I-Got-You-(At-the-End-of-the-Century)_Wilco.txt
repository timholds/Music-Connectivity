[Chorus]
I got you and it's all I need
I got you

[Verse 1]
I got you and I still believe
That you're all I will ever need
It's you, all

All the way back in the seventies
You were my little TV queen
You're Tarzan and your friend Janine

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
It's the end of the century
I can't think of anything

[Outro]
But you, all, all, I, need
I got you
I got you, babe
I got you
