Don't you know there are no simple answers?
Just keep talking to yourself
It's you and no one else

Don't you know that we are only human?
So be gentle and be kind
And be true to your own mind

I wonder what you want from me
You know it's all inside of you
Inside of you

Love and end, the truth of life
It's the ups and downs, the wrongs, the right
Say your prayer, turn out the light
Everything that you've become
What turns you off, what turns you on
Who you are, where you're from
Sleep tight

Everything's exactly as it should be
So let go all of your fears
And hold on to what it's here

The universe is turning and the lessons you've been learning
They make you who you are
You've made it through this far

I wonder what you want to be
You know it's all inside of you
Inside of you

Love and end, the truth of life
It's the ups and downs, the wrongs, the right
Say your prayer, turn out the light
Everything that you've become
What turns you off, what turns you on
Who you are, where you're from...

Whatever you do, whenever
You've got to trust yourself
You're holding it all together so long
People come and go but you will know yourself forever

I wonder what you want to be
You know it's all inside of you
Oh, inside of you

Love and end, the truth of life
It's the ups and downs, the wrongs, the right
Say your prayer, turn out the light
Everything that you've become
What turns you off, what turns you on
Who you are, where you're from
Sleep tight
Love and end the truth of life
It's the ups and downs, the wrongs, the right (Sleep tight)
Say your prayer, turn out the light
Everything that you've become
What turns you off, what turns you on (Sleep tight)
Who you are, where you're from
Sleep tight

Turn out the light
And you'll be fine
And then, you'll smile

Everything that you've become
What turns you off, what turns you on
Who you are, where you're from
Sleep tight
