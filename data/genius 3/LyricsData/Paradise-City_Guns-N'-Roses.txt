[Chorus] (x2)
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?

[Verse 1]
Just an urchin living under the street
I'm a hard case that's tough to beat
I'm your charity case, so buy me something to eat
I'll pay you at another time
Take it to the end of the line

Rags and riches, or so they say
You gotta keep pushing for the fortune and fame
You know it's, it's all a gamble, when it's just a game
You treat it like a capital crime
Everybody's doing the time

[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home

[Verse 2]
Strapped in the chair of the city's gas chamber
Why I'm here, I can't quite remember
The Surgeon General say's it's hazardous to breathe
I'd have another cigarette
But I can't see
Tell me who you're gonna believe

[Chorus]
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Take me home, yeah-yeah
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home

[Solo]

[Bridge] (x4)
So far away

[Verse 3]
Captain America's been torn apart
Now, he's a court jester with a broken heart
He said, "Turn me around and take me back to the start
I must be losing my mind
Are you blind?!
I've seen it all a million times

[Outro]
I wanna go
I wanna know
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see
How good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home?

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
(Take me home) Oh, won't you please take me home?
Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?

Take me down (ooh yeah)
Spin me 'round
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna see
How good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home?

I wanna see
How good it can be
Oh, won't you please take me home?

Take me down to the Paradise City
Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty
Oh, won't you please take me home?
I wanna go
I wanna know
Oh, won't you please take me home?

Baby
