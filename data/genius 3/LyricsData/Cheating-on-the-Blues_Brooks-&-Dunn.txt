[Verse 1]
He left you, she left me
Drowning in this misery
We stopped living
When they said, "Goodbye"
We've been faithful to these blues
But I've had enough now how 'bout you
But don't you think we've earned the right to go
Cheating on the blues tonight

[Chorus]
Cheating on the blues tonight
Let's go out and do it right
Throw it into overdrive
And get on down the road
Shake it until the break of dawn
Party until the heartache's gone
We'll have us a real good time
Cheating on the blues tonight

[Verse 2]
Pick you up, half past eight
You can bet I won't be late
With any luck
We'll make the dance by nine
We won't talk about the past
Let old memories die at last
Have some fun, keep it light
Cheating on the blues tonight

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Yes, we'll have us a real good time
Cheating on the blues tonight
