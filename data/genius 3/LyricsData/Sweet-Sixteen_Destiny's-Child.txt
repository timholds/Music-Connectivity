[Verse: LaTavia]
You couldn't tell little Jackie nothing
Sixteen, thought she knew it all
She was searching for the love she missed, yeah
And so she ran away

[Pre-Chorus:]
Slow down
You're moving way too fast
Sixteen
There's so much for you to have

[Chorus:]
Sweet Sixteen
Do you know where you're running to?
Do you know?
Sweet Sixteen

[Verse 2: Beyonc√©]
She fell in love with a man who was so fine
(so fine)
He made her promises, yeah
She didn't stopped to think if he was serious No, no, no
Until she had his baby
Sweet sixteen

[Pre-Chorus:]
Slow down
You're moving way too fast
Sixteen
There's so much for you to have

[Chorus:]
Sweet Sixteen
Do you know where you're running to?
Feel like you've got no where to go

[Post-Chorus:]
Sixteen years
Sixteen prayers
Sixteen reason why I care
Sixteen tears
You're sixteen still
Sweet sixteen
Girl

[Bridge:]
I know you're feelin' lonely
(I know you're feeling lonely)
Who you gonna turn to?
(Who you gonna turn to?)
Feels like the world is closing in on you (on you)
Sweet sixteen
You need to cherish what you have
You can forget about the past
Now you can start all over
You can start all over and
Cherish your life

[Pre-Chorus:]
Slow down
You're moving way too fast
Your only sixteen
There's so much more to life ahead

[Chorus 1:]
Sweet sixteen
Do you know where you're running to?
Sweet sixteen, girl
I know things get hard, so take take it slow
