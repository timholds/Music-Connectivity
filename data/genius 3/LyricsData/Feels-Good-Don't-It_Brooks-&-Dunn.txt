[Verse]
What's it like girl
To have somebody love you
With a love
Too good to be true
You ought to know
Feels good don't it
How bout those lonely nights
You used to pray
Something like this
Would come your way
Thank your lucky stars
Lucky's what we are
Feels good don't it
Some people go through life
Never knowing
What love is
Or where it's going
Me and you girl we just walked up on it
Feels good don't it
You and me girl
We're one of life's little wonders
We go together
Like lightning and thunder
Sky-high, On fire
Feels good, don't it
