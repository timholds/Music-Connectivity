[Verse 1]
My darling, I have wronged you
Down the devil's path I have roamed
Regret, sadness and sorrow
Now in my soul have found a home

[Chorus][x2]
My Sweet Caroline
From your loving arms I've strayed
In your heart may you find
Forgiveness I pray
A fool to temptation
I surely played
I come to you for salvation
Have mercy in love's name

[Verse 2]
The chilling cry of sin's wrath
Sounds like thunder through my head
I find no rest now no comfort
In a cold dark lonely bed

[Chorus][x2]
