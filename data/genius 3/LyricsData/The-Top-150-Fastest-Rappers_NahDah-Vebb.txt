In my raps, there's unlimited lyrics and syllables

Every single day I'm feeling caught in the middle of a bomb and a missle on the block with a pistol
Running away from a dozen cops and officals who won't stop with the whistle but they not being civil

Oh, thought of a riddle, what's a lot of a little?
Cause I just want to hit the fucking lotto a little pray to God for a nickle

So now I'm bout to take another shot and try to battle all my demons, can't let em win

#88 - K.Flay (12.9 Syllables Per Second)

Zakomodowani jak oko do cienia. Stale na dole, wychylam się znów
Robię to po to, by Tobie pokazać, że poza zasięgiem jesteśmy tu!
Deputowani się sami do dumy. Latami latamy za celu mirażem
Choć potu lanego na glebie kałuże, to mamy omamy, że plamy nie damy
Sami składamy te klipy do kupy i loopy. Do dupy tu robota ta
Lecz póki styka tu po to, by przeżyć i bitu paliwo, to noga na gaz!

And alligators, leaving craters while my radar mayday over Satellite

Song #1
Fuck a bitch until her pussy cat naps
Y'all niggas are pretty in pink
And you been chillin with the Brat Pack
Fact is, my stats kick your ass bitch
You're too average to consider surpassing
The task is tedious, really, this beat is just feeding me
You thought Gonzalez was

I hate when they call me a fast rapper
Shame on you hate mongers heaping the praise on them fake frauds
They’re claiming their favorites have got a gain on me, bating me often
But I’m remaining calm in a state of elated dominance
Aiming to body em, making a moniker
Breaking them down by the way that the audience savors every sound

#49 - Eradicate (14.2 Syllables Per Second)

Song #1
I go crazy with it in the kitchen
Bitch, run up out now tell em put your bitch in, hoe
Man I'm flowing crazy I cannot stop flipping
Police want to clap up me or put me in prison

Anybody really want to run up get thrown busting like a rifle, trying to play nice though
Bout to swing your life so, three clicks up in the red-dot sight, oh

Song #1
Look at your ass waiting like a dumb bitch
Wondering what kind of style I'mma come with
Who am I? Well, I figured it’d be as good a time as any for an introduction

Now I applaud anybody who attempts to stop, cause people can't even imagine an event to top
What I'mma bring, the badda bing, the kinda thing that with every syllable given I'm makin em wanna pretend to pop to bring

Song #1
Ja vi kender det godt. Nør vi tænder det op
Når vi går i seng og fucker
Never kan vi føle, sætter de sidste flasker på køl
Nah man jeg gider ikke engang begynde
Ja det var fedt fedt så jeg snakker lidt lidt telefon med min homie
De vil alle tjekke når vi ligger det
Kommer ind og smækker det, beatet jeg vækker det
I ved hvad der kommer ud af min mund
Hanger med de vildeste gutter
Det minder mig om vi stikker det af
For de kalder mig alle "vild fucking chopper”


#46 - Mozart MZ (14.2 Syllables Per Second)

Song #1
Quero tudo que a vida tem, traz
Soube que o que vem, vai
Mano eu tô num nível que não importa opinião
Dá um rolé no harém do pai, faz
Querer sempre mais
O rebolado dessa gata balançou meu coração
Então tá bom, bem
Então soma, tira a prova, se envolve na aula
Só pra ter assunto, reprovo e resolvo no mundo
O babaca para perto, pede pra ir junto
São pique racional, numeral, dois conjunto
"Rap é união mano, em prol do bem comum
MZ e seu som só de balançar o bumbum"
Mas a crítica e o drama é uma prova de [?]
Tua mina na minha cama, mentira, fazendo as unha
[?] em frente eu canetalho

My belt, I'm leaving to melt all over the desk cause imma spank ya
Picking yo' pocket, shot ya, boi I'm bout to leave you lifeless
I'm a real-life psycho going through my mid-life crisis, only 28 years old but I fight like a bleeding knight is

Spitting in the middle make a quickness stinging, bitch you can kill another bit
You can bet that you a killer when I'm filling the rhythm but the nigga kill em with a come-up and it billing niggas begin to feel this so ya
Personification of that beast-mode kill shit, the hardest nigga spitting and I put that on my children

Sick of the niggas who wanna be comin' at me with the drama

Wanna see a killa in the grave
But I bet you I'mma hit it with the venom when I gotta be the
Nigga that'll put a hollow tip up in your brain!
It's a lot of niggas talkin' 'bout they sick up in the brain
Talkin' 'bout they murder niggas but I hit 'em with the thang
Talkin' 'bout he was a homie but I know it wasn't funny so I
Catch a nigga slippin' then I gotta let it BANG!

Zu viel Stricher im Business, zu viel Hipsterpunkbitches
Doch zu wenig Munition in meinen Minigunclips
Ich geb' ein'n Fick auf alle Hoes, aber den Silver-Skunk-Jibbit
In dem siebzig Gramm Shit ist, splifft der Kifferschwamm chillig
Ah, tätowierte Ghetto-Gs
Beef mit Familys, street wie NMDs
Schieß' auf Enemys, realste Rap-MC
Aber Fler verpfeift das Team wie Referees
Kill em all ich hab die guncollection
Boom boom boom boom, schwammconnection
Starte kein Twitterbeef, habe kein killermotiv aber uberlege mir nen grund sie einfach
Anzustechen
Badabang badabang baller mit der gang alle
Renn'n kille deine gang vore den fans, wir lassen eventhallen brenn'n polier meine felgen
Am benz
Motherfucker enter das game, mit der family BBM-Gangster wir sprengen dein camp

Any enemies in the vicinity, I gotta mack up
They know they never can get with me whenever they mention me
The history of a lyrical criminal more deadly than chemicals
Check my resume, they said the Gillgod’s biblical

Think of me up on the block and I’m grabbin’ the .44
Tellin’ you pussy ass niggas, you niggas on top
Thinkin’ you niggas are ready for me? I don’t be givin’ a

Thinking of making a stang that will make me a couple of billion bucks and get buck as I’m ripping the heart out of the mic and then making it wicked, the poetry working me up

Song #1
Presenting it to the people even chopping and screwing it
Moving the people away from the secular music they coming and seeking the king
Then snap into hyper drive and making a mockery of em you know what I mean

Flowing to Michigan, California, Colorado, salute to the legendary chopping up with the Midwest

And all that we gifted, Seckond Chaynce'll don't admit the Spirit Fingers representing for all the (This is for the twiz)

Running and I gotta get away cause if they give in, they go pimpin and the pimpers trip in like I'm a convict
I didn't fucking start shit, off it like a deal, goes to show when I'm high and I've lost it
I was spitting to the song til it jumped off
Motherfuckers was in love with the Cane, saw
I turned niggas to stay with the Cane's all
Feel like a nigga git hit me with a chainsaw

Everybody wanna hear it they be looking for the rapture, and I'll be like BET, let me get into this laughter
Creeping up in the back not gonna believe that they digging the penmanship
Pulling and bullying niggas that come but they stopping we did it shoo
Really be going to pull up a battle and not hesitating to come in to strike in the booth with a nigga they kill the

But still gripping, handing over the mic, get ready to fight, there's no time to rhyme
I've slaughtered my life, it's nothing too strange, so ripping the mic
Ready to kill tonight

We blow when I'm in the zone, imma feed em my toast
It's eighteen, you're getting kinda slow
And then I'm ripping and ripping and ripping the mic, if some of them not giving not what they like
I'm picking a panel off when sprinting to write, hello, I'm just a fellow, just a kind-of mellow

#36 - Watsky (15 Syllables Per Second)

Song #1
Then I go, go, go, go, go
Every time I get a beat, I know I gotta beat it up
I bend it, then I break it, then I chop it, then I eat it up
And PETA would never approve of the way I've been treating the music
I bleed it, I bruise it, I kick it to the curb
And then I'm sipping on my bourbon, I be freaking it doing it, keeping it moving
I'm picking apart the muscle when I'm thinking about the hustle
But I'm nice, nice!

Hai!
This guy right here!
Credit to Reddit you bet I’ll never forget I’m forever indebted
And Ellen for getting the cougars to check it
It’s too good to take and so I’m gonna go dry my tears
Gonna meet up at a 7-Eleven to pick up a dank donut pack
I look at myself in the glass and go ‘Oh what?!’

#35 - K-Fix (15 Syllables Per Second)

Song #1
And that’s how do it that mentality that I’m living with
When I’m spitting, there’s really ain’t no motherfucking punchline
When i be rocking the mic I be giving the niggas the business
And breaking them off with the lyrical heat and leaving with em this shit and be leaving em tongue tie!

It’s time for me fill ’em with venom and behead ’em up and I’ll chop ’em to bits
Better believe that I'm being on my level and never be ready for droppin’ this
You cut ’em with venom in head, I tell ’em you better be gettin’ ’em hustled I might of been beneath and fuckin’ around, I’ma take it to head with the medal and pop the Smith

Song #1
Never been a counterfeit of nothing I am just an elevated
Entity I’m coming and giving it back and then pumping
Dump on every instrument with increments of syllables
And sentiments I lunge I’m livid again I’m sticking it in
Their muffins make a couple million I’m hoping to I’m going to
So gimme another reason I should sit around an not experience
Benefits of getting down when all the drivel that they’re spitting
Is so hideous Godzilla fear the viciousness!

Bitch, just because you work hard doesn't mean you get rich
But I'll be taking Michelle Bachman and sitting her down, sticking my dick in and licking and ticking and kicking her out

Severing your arteries, the hardest man I gotta be a lyric killer sazzing when I'm spazzing on the instrumental
Top nobody choppers that be thinking that they got it, I'm the illest, don't forget it cause you know that I be popping
And my homies down to rock, I got a semi and I pop it
I'm the hottest, no one stop us, so impossible with godly flows
I cannot send the game, got the boulders in your brain
Now would you want to listen and just watch this music

Hittin their head and make music and then I will lunge drop a knife when I hit em and kill em and slither enemies hitting em up with the brain
Somebody chugging I'm baking it backing it send em look at the way you doing it making the money, making it final
Taking a buck kind of just want to change

End up and run from the hood a bitch
Fuck withn the nigga Loony and the body parked in the ditch
If they really wanna come and get it with the chopper that dump a clip, I fuck with the Brainsick cause I hit you with voodoo

Murdering thinking 'come up with little rejection'
I hit em with the venom when I get to part, Bin on Osama shit
If a nigga really want it run up and get killed but I offer really pop a clip
Guess we in the middle with a knife on that voodoo

Song #1
Finna beat the instrumental like it was a denim
I'll be in your mental, fill 'em on the middle
Every time I sit and think about the Voodoo
They be happy and I'm on 'em, wake up and
I knew the mommy was a goner
Papa never run away, now put the gun away
Before a bullet's put up in your fruit loop

I will eventually get to runnin’ whenever they make it impossible
Hit a motherfucker with the venom and I put ’em all up in the hospital
Do you want it with the funk, I’m grabbin’ a pump
And I be doin’ the voodoo
Deuce-deuce through your window
And I shoot two through your nostril
Fuck ’em all, hit ’em all, kill ’em all
I hate they whole clique though
Really you mad at me because your bitch on my dick, so
Hit her all up on the Facebook say ’hey, look, it’s Twisted Insane
Come give me brain’, so just hopped in my 6-4

Song #1
Tutte le volte vado più forte mi diverto come nelle giostre non me ne fotte se non capisci
La potenza dell'extrabeat
Propongo delle proposte propositive che vi possono fare uscire davvero da tutta questa shit
Sclero voglio superare il cielo come un alieno gli scarsi nemmeno li vedo ai miracoli so
Che ci credo
Sono sereno pure se crolla il mondo intero mica come Svevo dopo che scrisse tutta quanta
La coscienza di Zeno

Di lato, di perfetta comprensione sparo parole calibro nove
Mitragliatore di precisione faccio musica di professione
Non mi interessa la protezione delle persone con la pressione e la propensione a camminare
Per ore come dentro una processione

Engo a darte un par de frases
De esas que me han dicho que no forman parte
Por cuidar mi diccion El Chojin comparte
Con todos los otros los que viven rap, o no??
No pretendo polemizar pero es que muchos mc´s no saben vocalizar
No los entiendo tienen huecos los textos
Si no tienes nada que hablar quedate en silencio

Yo! vengo a darte un par de frases
De esas que me han dicho que no forman parte
Por cuidar mi diccion El Chojin comparte
Con todos los otros los que viven rap, o no??
No pretendo polemizar pero es que muchos mc´s no saben vocalizar
No los entiendo tienen huecos los textos
Si no tienes nada que hablar quedate en silencio
Todos tienen derecho a hablar
Pero no nos castigues con tu basura de rap
Solo aprende a respetar cual es tu lugar
Y yo no te castigare con mi furia verbal
(Como!) Como quieres que la gente te oiga
Con esa lengua tan grande que no te cabe en la boca
En este club como en todos nos regimos por normas
La primera es que se entienda lo que dices SI IMPORTA!
Cada vez que me ves haciendo el papel
De mc contra el que resistirse equivale a perder
Debes comprender que para hacer esto bien
No solo es rimar que tambien hay que valer
Venga!!

#24 - NoClue (16.5 Syllables Per Second)

Song #1
You can feel the wrath of a menace from the beginning
Come against a type of nigga like me and I'm sinning
Better pray to God that you're in it to win it
Cause I get to rippin it like ain't nobody fuckin with it
Too egotistic, list it, raps theistic
Fuck, you missed it
Gotta couple loose screws in my head
So you better keep your distance
Keep a witness hit list

Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music

See, your heart rate is normal, your breathing is regular? and your body temperature is stable, et cetera
I have never seen somebody so healthy in my career as a doctor I'm telling ya (what?)
There's literally nothing I can give you, not a pill, not a drug nor an ointment
You ain't even bother making an appointment, this is nothing but a pure disappointment

Ready get set
The level of the skill will determine the respect

#20 - Danjor (17.6 Syllables Per Second)

Song #1
My chopping ability's cavernous, taking a beat and going to ravage it
Having everybody wonder what's happening, unlimited energy's what I'm tapping in
A machine gun is popping a cap in it, locking the body up in the cabinent
Articulate and intricate when I'm ripping it, I gotta be fucking immaculate
I'm the executioner, welcome to my dungeon
I grab a spiked mace, gonna hit you with the bludgeon, if you're questioning why I do it
It's because I'm a speed demon, and I'm just answering the summons

Hit em with the double time, when I go and bust a rhyme, even with a couple lines, you are never touching mine, did ya hear that
When I go into gear,  I'm in a different tier, if you are alive after a meeting, you should count that as a lucky try
People are still sleeping on this dog like I'm Wei Shen, treating me like I'm little kid in the play pen, even though I'm wrecking
The competition, where they're lacking I'm packing, I'm whacking em all, anybody still doubt that I'm one of the best? Okay then

LIGHTSPEED...

Sentimental when I be leaving em heavens upheaving while I be looking at them with a devilish look on my face!
Murder any motherfucker thinking the brnging it better, topping em all, poppin em all and I'm doing it for the cheddar
They give me money, then you thinkin it funny fucking em all up with the speed there ain't a motherfucker spittin thats better than me I'm steeping into ya path
And I'm spraying em all, droppin gem all, somebody thinking they bringing it better than mine when I'm running up into the game and I'm coming to get em with the way that I'm do it I'm doing it
Put em in a body cast, I tell em all to swing

It's really been a little minute since I had to rap fast, got to do it like a nazi man I'm bout to gas that
Killings in the Holocaust, then bomb end up in my backpack
But it's stupid hating bout to kill cause I'm a spaz man
Even though I'm tripping I'm an eighty on the adderal
Keeping me from writing but I guess I am the bad and all
Losing all my famine and I'm bout to roll just like a ball
People like the way that I be chopping, man I hate it all

Repeat, alright x2
Coming to get'em hit'em with my venom then ima be chopping them all into pieces!
Chopping a body cause im a killer so I do it with minimal reasons
Ripping'em up to illest chopper when I get up on the track!
Bout to be banging them all when I am ready to attack!
Then im tearing your body down to a molecular scale!
When the cops find your body it will already be pale!
Dumping the guts over the side into the bay, over the rail
Chopping off your head, and send it to your parents through the mail

Psycho like im michael at thanksgivin gettin savage attackin a track choppin it up like a ninja

Rhythm ive written killin the competition wit the ammunition when spittin
Choppin em up and bustin em down like a demolition derby like im on a mission; special edition, mint condition cuz their hasnt been a thirsty nigga ta merk me wit lyrics
From the clearance isle gimmickin tryin to mimic this image yall better off packin a picnic wit a mortician bitches

(Free advice)
Packing semen of a demon being a heathen beating seeds in any region making a legion while I'm reading it like I'ma rapping yakkin Charles Manson
While I be given a reason for you to believe in I'm a beast beasting it every season teething and feasting feeding Off beats like I'm treating myself for my own personal satisfaction
Acting up acting out with the action with tactics putting tax on the verses im no freestyler my style isn't free febreezing it fresh with the way that I be serving up the motherfuking murder
When working overtime being a hard worker performing that lyrical serial killer horror Halloween when I'm on the scene making it reality Optimiz Prime sort of like a Transformer

Soha! Ostoba, én ha osztom az észt
A kosztomon élsz, ahogy kóstolod, posztod a face-en, nos, hogy a mosdóba mész
Most jön a mostoha rész: roskad a fostól a WC, robban a bél
Kinek fogsora ép és a mosolya szép, ahhoz gyors’ oda lépsz, rajta morzsolva szét

Meg jöhet az EPILEPSZIA!
Eleve tele van az agyam beteges elemekkel, amik elegye fekete
A szavak e mellett, amiket tekerek, akarom mondani, ennek a veleje
Annyira meredek, aki hall, berezel, pörög az agya, hogy szedek-e szereket
Kitör a háború, mindenki pánikol, para van, amikor a beton beremeg
Pedig én nem vagyok gonosz, ám a dolog, az, ami ideköt, elveszi eszemet
De nem a tipikus, piti kis emberek, hanem a lirika mitikus ereje
Apokaliptikus ennek a jellege, "automatikusan nyerek" a jelige
Dobogón topogó, veni, vedi, vici, valaki tehet-e valamit

You try to black the light but imma tell you something
You'd better be ready for the battle with the Gods when the spirit of the light hits the children of the lost, the wicked about to pay the cost when Saint Seven blows the trumpet

Rising to another level demons try to injure any pride and confidence within my soul but I don't hear it
I'm gonna be getting back on the mic when I gotta be breaking and hitting them up with cynical venom be getting up in them bringing Armageddon to anybody thinking they wanna battle because everybody gotta be getting ready for the hyper radical damage when I'm rapping and bagging the beat I'm flipping and dropping and leaving everybody eradicated with a vengeance when I be dropping my syllables at a super sonic speed but hypothetically I'm super humanely gifted I get up on the microphone I gotta make them bleed packing and busting a gat attacking them niggas asking them what they gonna do I get up on the microphone hit them up with the venom by chopping breaking and chewing the rhythm when niggas think they ready to come against me I slam them on the ground like a gavel

Yeah, one of the world's fastest rappers...
But hit em with vision while want to be murderers one to be making the money up with the venom would you understand it when venom when I'm taking em in their head but when I'm waking em making the master I didn't really want to be one to end it topping the stop of any one that be taking the individual

Now I'm taking the mic and I'm rapping at venomous full speed
Gain the momentum and hit 'em with rhythm, I'm verbally making 'em all bleed
Dropping the sound in the waves and doing it fast, think all of you agreed
What am I doing now? So sick when velocity limits I exceed
And if somebody wanna run up I will turn him into piece of raw meat
I'ma now wondering how to write bars and then rap 'em to make it all complete
It's rather hard but when you put heart to that, it will be guaranteed
All of these syllables feeding me up and I'm chopping 'em up, so let's eat

Et away or stay and laugh 'cause I do it my way, I could not obey, give it up like they say, still living with doubt everyday though, day by day
But now I'm here, not anymore filled with fear and my speed massacres every single enemy
Making 'em wrecking and ringing and breaking 'em, packing the mic and I'm bringing it back and taking out wack and irregular, packing and bagging 'em, sick of them thinking they rocking and swagging, I'm making 'em bringing their agony

When I'm popping em off wit lyrical toxic venomous drops
Then I'm spitting and racking the victims thinking that hØllÖw's on rocks
Leaving the cops checking the blocks when I detonate these bombs
Spitting a boss Holocaust with a nuclear exhaust
Figured they mosh faggot I'm gosh suck a Medusa head of cocks
I'm fucking Pandora and Lemarchand wit the same box

Off, I flow and it makin em cough, I'm the chopper that breakin jaw, if there's somebody wanting talk, I be drowning em in a trough, rapper that rapin, the devil to Satan, I'm comin and wreckin em all, poppin a case in, like medication, fuck it I'm going off, GO, somebody fakin I chop him to bacon exploding off of the bomb I'm makin coming to break it don't suffer debating fuckin bet that I'm dominating, double the rap and I'm makin it fast and leavin the whack all stumbling back when I'm steppin up on the track and I be choppin a rapper to converse

But they never even know, cause I'm so underground
They never even flow cause they below supersonic sound
Ripping em out, closing their mouth, weighing the pound, taking it down
Doing it up and every single motherfucker gonna be shutting it down, but they can't even fucking keep up


#9 - Rebel XD (20.3 Syllables Per Second)

Song #1
So now you better be ready to meet the devil
But I don't dance I just heat up fellows
And you looking so sweet little bo peep and I'm pissed
And even though you may be white as snow, it'll show
Because when you take a leak in the snow
You can always see the spot where the pee is yellow
He's like a Child, while a power type man
But he came at me with a bad act
Like "Hey, I'm DNA" and I was like OK
But if you think I give a shit kid then you got it backwards
So how bout you say yo name

That shit is old, so I getting mo', keep spitting cold, lyrics are tempt niggas fo'
So man hit the road, and don't come back, what makes you think that we want your raps
The fact we ain't even gotta bump your tracks, cause that shit is fat, and try to bust hold back

Sick of the mike and makin a rap while im stepin and pullin my hand then i forgettin them and pullin my enemies set them to a middle were then i send them to a way then im makin one of them get out of my sight
While im comin and rockin the mike and makin it hyper and im gettin it tight for a radical rhyme thats becomin tight
And im makin the people send them a part and one will be jumpin and humpin thats settin them off in a battle and steppin
To be the mike with my hand and im makin it hot

#7 - MC Rice (22.1 Syllables Per Second)

SONG #1 NEEDS FRENCH TRANSCRIBING

Avec revolushan music je débite sans limite, mon flow vous attire et vous déciment avec mes lyriques, il est maléfique
Il a un pouvoir symbiotique. Pour vous dire qui je suis je débite de plus en plus vite
Entendez-vous ce rire diabolique qui résonne sur ce beat?
C'est ceux qui ont défié mon débit, à présent ils sont adepte de la folie, prenez-garde les amis car j'arrive
Mes lyriques me submergent et je débite
Ici MC Rice, je tabasse à coup de ligne de basse pour diffuser mes punchlines à travers l'espace

Sabe que nadie lo invade, te aseguro que todos lo saben que el que menos sabe, lo sabe que escomo lo ensayooo
Mira como la persona se presta para darle seguido lo que disparo, lo menos que hago yo despierto el gallo para menos traer el sol en tu invierno, saben que estoy loco y nadie sabe mas que yoooaaa
Prepárate para escuchar lo más rápido que se ha conocido
Te apuesto que nunca has oído algo parecido, tu eres testigo
De mi agilidad, habilidad que yo tengo para meterle velocidad
No sé qué tan bueno pueda ser que tenga esta capacidad
Pero cada VEZ yo siento, que tengo que ir más de prisa veloz
Soy el único que puede viajar al pasado o futuro con solo mi voz
Yo rompo todas las marcas los records, habidos y por haber
Tirando tan rápidamente que puedes sentir mí poder
Soy como una metralleta disparando sin límite de balas
Palabras que nunca se acaban cada que acelero me salen las alas
Yo siento que vuelo despego me elevo en tan solo un segundo

#2 - TheJackal (26.5 Syllables Per Second)

Song #1
An Other muthafucker thinkin they gonna go fast on the beat
But I'm proud to admit that I'm crowned as elite
And I'm gradually gonna murder the beat
With Multiple Schemes as I crush all their dreams
Coz yall fail to keep up with the keeper and the beater of beats up when he speeds up and cleans up and weakest of speakers now preach to your leader he'll teach ya to eat up any other feature, imma

Planetary choppers, and I'll break it like a bottle
Takin off it in my shuttle, other rappers better scuttle
Cause I'm pullin on the the throttle and imma rock it in my rocket
Better "watch" it like a pocket and im better than you "sock it" in the jaw
Man I'm spittin raw and I'm bout to mawl
TheJackal's vicious dawg
Hoppin like a frog I'm the rapper with it all
Chop you like a log and down you fall, ha!

Moment envyin moment and I haven't even spoken like lightning kinda frightening huh
Bet you ain't ready for this bruh
Ahaha here we go, might be a little rusty
(HURAH)
Hit em with a muthafucka they don't wanna come when I get up in the club and I hit em with a bus
That's 26 and I'm about to go faster!
