[Intro - Busta Rhymes]
Aiyyo, somebody tell Steven Spielberg and George Lucas thank you for directing this movie!

[Ron Browz]
Hashi Miki Hallah! Means "It's The Remix!"

[Hook - Busta Rhymes]
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine

[Ron Browz]
Oh! We getting Arrab money! We getting Arab money!

[Verse 1 - Busta Rhymes]
Look, you can talk about your money but I really don't care
I'm into copping strange shit, now I'm trying to buy air! (gasps)
As the first black nigga that's a rap trillionaire
I control heat, I'm about to buy the ozone layer!
I'm into copping minerals now: diamonds and granite
So much paper I could probably gift wrap a planet
And clone a million Janets
Respect my accomplishments
As Salam Alaykoum Wa Rahmatoullah Wa Barakatouh !!

[Hook]
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine

[Verse 2 - Diddy]
Hamdoullilah with my billions pilin'
I'm just wyling, bought 2 islands
Lakshmi Mittal-in', diamonds is salmon
Bout to buy 5th Ave, bitch I'm just stylin'
Money insane; while Jay was popping bottles
I was buying out planes just to fly around Spain
Fuck a recession, I'm still invested
Bout to buy Dubai and swim in the shark section
Fuck it, the dark section
Bitch, that's the Barack section

[Hook]
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine


[Verse 3 - Ron Browz]
You might catch me in a coup that cost 100 thous
"Haka la Sheika" means "I love you, Ron Browz!"
My money make noise, yours quiet as a mouse
Send an e-mail: Ether Boy's in the house
All the girls love me, yeah I pop bubbly
"Haka hashahi" means "shorty, dumb, ugly"
Find me on the dance floor doing the duggy
Trucks sit high, dude, next to your buggy

[Hook]
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine


[Verse 4 - Swizz Beatz]
Don't call me Swizz no more
Call me Kasim Daoud Shams ul-Din
When I come through, hit you with that brand new
Bugatti Coupe; damn thing only-only seats 2
But you know who (who?) Goon who be riding in my passenger
Side, we be flying shit, 2.5 in it
Hey, h-hey-hey-HEY - I'm in my Jeezy watching TV
She call me "Ha-habibi" while she feeding me linguine
Left right, l-left right - that Arab dance popping right
Swizz Beatz, Busta Bus, the money-money buss pipes

[Hook]
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine


[Verse 5 - T-Pain]
I let my chain hang down with the rest of them
Teddy Pain rain down on the rest of them
Mr. Stripper Man that be hollering "get em man!" I'm at em, man
Rubberband; dropping money bombs like a Taliban
Oh la la, we getting Arab money
You want this hook, you gonna pay that money
Save that money, give it to my kids
I'll take that honey, give her all my kids like -

[Hook]
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine


[Verse 6 - Akon]
I got that Arab money
4-star Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim
Straight cash when I come in
Lemme exchange the currency cause it's all foreign
I got that A-RAB MONEY!
Waking up to 5 concubines in the morning
Diamond mines still runnin'
On all of Africa, you can ask Tarzan

[Hook]
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine


[Verse 7 - Lil' Wayne]
Calendar say I get money everyday
Smile look like iced-out Perrier
Bury me a G and tell her kids that I was
Now jump into your grave if you dig what I dug
Cash Money Universal a multi-check
20 chains look like a scarf on my neck
Young Money Entertainment: girls and fame
(Adopt a motherfucker in the Money Hall of Fame)
Arab money

[Hook]
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine
Oh! We getting Arrab money! We getting Arab money!
Bismillah Al Rahman Al Rahim !
Al Hamdoullilah Ya Rabi L'Halamine
Oh! We getting Arrab money! We getting Arab money!
