[Verse 1: Eminem]
I want you
To understand something
That when I come up in this bitch
I want the fans jumping
I want the fists pumping in the air
I don't look like a millionaire
But I feel like a million bucks
Ladies won't ya fill your cups
Shady's come to feel ya up
Are you a D or a C cup?
You could even be a B
It's just me and D-R-E
You'll be in the ER
We are strapped with so much TNT
We may blow
No not even CPR from the EMTs
Could help you to resuscitate
You busters must be flustered, wait
You can't cut the mustard
What's your problem, can't you bust a grape?
(Chkk-chk-chk) What's my name?
Shady came and just crushed the game
It's really not even fair to them
'Cause they pale in comparison
So much they might as well wear his skin
Don't you wish you could just share his pen?
'Cause this shit's getting embarrassin'
The fog is thick and the air is thin
'Cause he won't even let them try to breathe
La-dididi-dadada-didi
He makes it look so easy
Girl, you just hit the lottery

[Hook]
Now this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us
You can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink
No matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems
We're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre & (Eminem)]
This is when shit hits the fan
Like it just splattered on Stan
This is the only moment that matters
Your homie rolled in with Mathers
Now chaos erupts
Em's in back, Dre's in the front
So do what we say at once
This songâ€™s like a seance, it haunts
(It makes them stay in a trance
No choice, they have to dance)
It's like the playoffs
Just making sure that we stay in the hunt
Take a day off of what?
Man, you better lay off the blunts
You must be smoking something
You think I ain't smoking nothing
Stay off my nuts
Now hit the floor baby
Time to wipe away all the rust
Shake all them cobwebs loose
Loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose
Yeah, girl, shake that caboose
I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse
D-R-E is on the loose
A mongoose when it comes to the chronic use
You know I can't stand to lose
Me and my goons are like animals
We come through like a pack of wolves
And we came here to retract the roof
Yeah man, ain't that the truth
Girl, your man's back in the booth
Definitely back up in this bitch
And this is when all hell breaks loose

[Hook]
Now this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us
You can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink
No matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems
We're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Now I know you're feeling discouraged
But homie just mark my words
I'm murdering the flow
Liquid courage
I'm fin' to blow
As soon as we hit the door
Power surges head to toe
I'm sure
To push it as far as words
Are meant to go
We're in the indigo Winnebago
With tinted windows
Ferocious
As we proceed
To beat up the block wit' your ho
With speakers knocking
It's 3 o'clock
Me and Doc
Then proceed to drop E
And hop out the vehicle
And knock on your do'

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
Yeah, so let us in
'Fore we huff and puff and we blow
We ain't bluffing for nothing
We'll knock the stuffing out you
Revenge is so sweet
Move 'til you injure your feet
Yeah, move it or lose it freak
Move to the beat
Lose yourself indubitably
Pass up on that little cute chick right there
That'd be pretty damn stupid to me
Born and raised in the CPT
Yeah, Los Angeles, rules of the streets
Them haters hating on me
But I refuse to lose any sleep
Keep that deuce-deuce in the seat
Dre fall off? That's news to me

[Hook]
Now this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
Try to restrain us
You can't contain us
We're still gonna make a stink
No matter what we do
Everywhere we go it seems
We're looking for any excuse
To just cut loose
So this'll be the part of the song
That they drop the needle on
And hell breaks loose
