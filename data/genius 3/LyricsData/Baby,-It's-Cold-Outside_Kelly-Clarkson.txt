[Verse 1: Kelly Clarkson (w/ Ronnie Dunn)]
I really can't stay
(Baby, it's cold outside)
I've got to go away
(Baby, it's cold outside)
This evening has been so very nice
(Been hoping that you'd drop by
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice)
My mother will start to worry
(Beautiful, what's your hurry?)
My father will be pacing the floor
(Listen to the fireplace roar)
So really I'd better scurry
(Beautiful, please don't hurry)
Oh, maybe just a half a drink more
(Put some records on while I pour)
The neighbors might think
(Oh, it's bad out there)
Say, what's in this drink
(No cabs to be had out there)
I wish I knew how to break the spell
(Your eyes are like starlight now
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell)
I ought to say no, no, no, sir
(Mind if I move a little closer?)
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
(What's the use in hurting my pride?)
I really can't stay
(Baby don't hold out)
Oh, but it's cold outside (Oh, but it's cold outside)

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson (w/ Ronnie Dunn)]
I simply must go
(Baby, it's cold outside)
The answer is no
(Baby, it's cold outside)
Your welcome has been so nice and warm
(Baby, it's cold outside
Look out the window at that storm)
My sister will be suspicious
(Gosh, your lips look delicious)
My brother will be there at the door
(Waves upon a tropical shore)
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
(Your lips are delicious)
Well, maybe just a cigarette more
(Never such a blizzard before)
I've got to get home
(Baby, you'll freeze out there)
Say, lend me your coat
(It's up to your knees out there)
You've really been grand
(I'm thrilled when you touch my hand)
But don't you see
(How can you do this to me?)
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
(Think about my life long sorrow)
At least there'll be plenty advised
(If you caught pneumonia and died)
I really can't stay
(Get over that old out)
But it's cold outside (But it's cold outside)
