[Hook:]
Hey my trunk vibrating and my rims keep skating
And the shawdies keep choosing cause they know what's going down
I was on that 5 minutes wait for parking lot pimping, when a bad chick approached me, she was caramel brown
I told her get in, get in, get in, get in
I told her get in, get in, get in, get in
I told her get in, get in, get in, get in
Cause I pull up, stuntin' on they ass

[Verse 1:]
Yup, I'm the man, cup in my hand
Doing what I want, doing what I can
Do it for my fans, real ass niggas
Independent women and them trill ass niggas
I'mma blow 'em money, every day
I'mma ball out, every way
I'mma real nigga, do it cause I love it
I'm like Evel Knievel, I'm stunting out in public
Call me stunt man! Daredevil!
I got that woodstock, that heavy metal
Flashing like lights, toss hoes like dice
Get money, get money, this ain't happen overnight

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Hey, I'mma boss now, I call plays
I'm runnin' on 'em, that's all day
That's all the way, that's (?)
If the folk know the play, call an audible
Vest on my chest, that's just my past
(?) my dash? Leave you on your ass
My team on mash, juggernaut for real, ho
They knew I was the stunt man, so what they in my grill for?
Jump fresh all the time, feelin' like a million bucks
Billion, trillion, gazzillion, what's after that? A million bucks
I'm riding like a million trucks, strong like a million hogs (?)
(?) with this strength, I didn't even have to power up

[Hook:]

[Outro:]
Big shout to Multi Alumni!
Supaman! Big Sant! Big (?), what up homie?
See me on top nigga! Volume 3!
