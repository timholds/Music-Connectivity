WOO!
WOO!
WOO!
BREATHE!

[Bridge]
One and then the two
Two and then the three
Three and then the four
Then you gotta BREATHE
One and then the two
Two and then the three
Three and then the four
Then you gotta BREATHE
Then you gotta *gasp*
Then you gotta *gasp*

[Hook]
Yo these niggas can't breathe when I come through
Hum too, some shoes, gotta be twenty, man
It's not even funny, they can't (breathe)
The chokehold's too tight
The left looks too right
You know what, you right
These bitches can't (breathe)
Look look, they hearts racing, they start chasing
But I'm so fast when I blow past that they can't (breathe)
In the presence of the man
Your future look better than your past if you present with the man
You better (breathe)

[Verse 1]
You niggas can't share my air
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear
And I'm getting better year by year, like they say wine do
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the K-9's through
And I pace myself
I know these money-hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth
But I keep em on a diet
Embrace they health, or either keep em on the quiet
And space myself and just take a deep breath
I got em grabbing they chest
Cause it's hurting them to see Fab in his best
And they in they worst
They'd rather see me lay in a hearse than lay in the 'Bach
And I ain't just laying a verse, I'm saying the facts
I came back with some sicker stones
That got these broke niggas looking at me
Like they choking on a chicken bone
Every chick I bone can't leave the dick alone
So I know it's one of them every time I flip my phone

Breathe!

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I see them on the block when I passes
Looking like they need oxygen mask-es
I make it hard to (breathe)
But I keep the Glocks in the stashes
Cause the cops wanna lock and harass us
And make it hard to (breathe)
They has to react, like having an asthma attack
When they see the plasma in back
You dudes are wheezing behind me
My flow is like a coupe, breezing at ninety
That's the reason they signed me
The slick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts
Feels something like hard punches to the gut
How I address the haters and underestimaters
And ride up on em like they escalators
They shook up and hooked up to respirators
On they last breath talking to investigators
I'm a breath of fresh air in a fresh pair
Face it boo and do it till your face get blue
And then (breathe)

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Yo these niggas can't...
When the crew walk in it, pop a few corks in it
As quick as a tick in a New York minute
Catch a breath, 'fore you catch a left
Even worse, catch a Tef', only way you catch an F
To the A-B, it's in the May-B, rolling with my baby
Gripping on a toy that you won't find at KB
I rhyme slick on ya
They gon' have to put the Heimlich on ya
What you know bout letting dimes lick on ya
While you inhale the weed
And it won't stop till they inhale your seed
And it don't stop till I tell 'em to breathe
Like a doctor with a stethoscope
I don't see no fucking hope
Unless these motherfuckers breathe

[Outro]
Yeah, Brooklyn gotta
Uptown gotta
The Bronx gotta
Queens gotta
Staten Isle gotta
You niggas gotta
You bitches gotta
Everybody (BREATHE!)

One and then the two
Two and then the three
Three and then the four
Then you gotta... (BREATHE)
Then you gotta...
Then you gotta...
BREATHE!
