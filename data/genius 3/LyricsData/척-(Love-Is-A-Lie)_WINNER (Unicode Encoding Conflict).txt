Translated

[Verse 1: JinWoo]
I tell a red lie
“I still meet up with her
She only has eyes for me
And I feel the same way”

[Verse 2: Mino]
To friends and acquaintances
I tell lies like Pinocchio
From hiding my farewell
My nose grows longer
I’m hopeless as a person
My body is stiff as wood
Your chat ID disappears
And your profile picture changes
But I didn’t want to admit it
So I continued to pretend it wasn’t over
I didn’t want to admit we broke up

[Pre-Hook: Taehyun & SeungYoon]
I pretended our love was still flaming and hot
I pretended everything was fine and nothing was wrong
Pretending, but how come
You and I broke up uh uh uh

[Hook: SeungHoon & Taehyun & Mino]
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is a lie
I just want to let everything go
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is
Hey what? My love’s a lie

[Verse 3: SeungYoon]
As if some other me was breaking up
I wanted to switch sides
Hope and torture are the same
I'm getting used to it

[Verse 4: SeungHoon]
A finale with my closest friends
Eventually I blew up, damn it
I spilled it all at the end
They said I told them
While crying in the corner
And banging my head against the wall
I became a total rice cake
I was like a rainbow rice cake
But well done

[Pre-Hook: Taehyun & JinWoo]
I pretended our love was still flaming and hot
I pretended everything was fine and nothing was wrong
Pretending, but how come
You and I broke up uh uh uh

[Hook: SeungHoon & Taehyun & Mino]
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is a lie
I just want to let everything go
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is
Hey what? My love’s a lie

[Bridge: Taehyun]
Even today, I commit a crime against you again
I say “I miss you” when no one is around

[Verse 5: Multiple]
What do you want me to do
I don’t want to admit it
I just want to erase it all
Love is so bad
But I can’t empty my head out
No matter how hard I try
I’m just going to live in my delusion
Don’t leave me alone

[Pre-Hook: SeungYoon & Taehyun]
I pretended our love was still flaming and hot
I pretended everything was fine and nothing was wrong
Pretending, but how come
You and I broke up uh uh uh

[Hook: SeungHoon & Taehyun & Mino]
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is a lie
I just want to let everything go
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is a lie
Lie, lie, love is
Hey what? My love’s a lie
