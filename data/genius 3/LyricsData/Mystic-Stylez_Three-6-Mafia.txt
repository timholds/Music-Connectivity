[Intro: DJ Paul]
Ah yea We finna get ready
To bump that "Smoked out, loced out" part two

[Hook: Lord Infamous]
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia
Mafia, Mafia, Mafia, Mafia

[Verse 1: Playa Fly]
Bustaz get so dazed and amazed
As Lil' Fly's enchants
Memories of smoked out loced out
Puffed out as them demons dance
Playaz lookin' wild, stole our style
Devils in me so Fly can get so violent
Bustas silent when I'm on that blow
Enhance my skills to make me treal
Treal enough to kill at will
Will I kill you
Fly will peel you off da map that's all so real
Don't you mothasuckas often wonder what to call this shit
Uhmm, call it Mystic Stylez cause Fly's style so mystic bitch

[Verse 2: MC Mack]
The pimpin' mack is kickin' with the clique that's known as Triple 6
Don't bar no lemon busta niggas we dont love 'em
In a trunk is where I stuff 'em
Suckas run they liquor I deliver nigga hollow thangs
Ain't got no feelings when im killin' cluckers busta duck for cover
I come with a chrome y'all can makin' hoes pay the cost
Infared to ya head full of lead yawkin' lames
You can betcha by the dollar that I'm spittin' game
Niggas underestimate my pimpin' but mackin' but trippin' sprayin'
Layin' skanky bitches to the canvas and bustas can I man

[Bridge: Lord Infamous]
Mystic Styles of the ancient mutalations
Torture, chambers filled with corpses in my basement
Feel the, wrath of the fuckin' devilition
Three 6 Mafia creation of Satan

[Verse 3: Gangsta Boo]
My styles are slick, yo body bitch that I will chop in pieces
No fuckin' clue to da 5-0 click
No fuckin' witnesses an...
They only saw da mask of Jason that I had on my face
The scandalous bitch is so-so slick that why I got away safe
I blaze da blunt up in da air just to relax and get high
Da moon is full and all I see is 6-6-6 in da sky
The Three 6 Mafia
Tha devils daughter bitch is so wild
Whateva you bitches are doin' you cannot compare to my mystic style

[Verse 4: La Chat]
I'm creepin' up on these hoes with the muthafuckin' shotgun
A nigga wit tha 9's showin' these bitches they can't get none
Woopin' and dumpin' and stompin' and doggin' these bitches wit anamosity
Pimpin' and breakin' and cakin' these niggas
Cause these hoes can't fuck wit me
LaChat got tha gat
Creepin' up from tha back
Chrome tone now it's on
Neva love a nigga joan
Cause I'm a crazy bitch cuttin' off niggas dicks
Man ho takin' these niggas gotta keep it rich
Bitches be runnin' they mouth about this female they dont know about
Suckas be talkin' that shit I'm puttin' these funky niggas on da house

[Verse 5: Crunchy Black]
Mystic Styles in my head as I smoke on a blunt
Yo Crunchy Black da demons child has a mean ass stun
I had to buck you off runnin' yo mouth with tha weak ass shit
You need to keep it closed trick before you get yo wig split
A candle light the demon night is what it have to be
Another problem for tha folks on Unsolved Mysteries
Ya thought I was dead naw instead I just faked on yo ass
And now I'm back wit that mask and I'm ready to blast

[Verse 6: Koopsta Knicca]
Now tell me something has emerged
Legions of demons
Koopsta Knicca finna
Rip 'em in plenty trick
For a date with my smith & wesson
Bitch you living
Now you cowards waitin' to bite our fuckin' style
Rip his legs
Cut him down
Bitch with mass up in his town
Niggas bout to break ya somethin' off up in that house of torture
Steppin' to that Koopsta bitch
Da wicked witch of horror
Horror da chambers the demons that came up
To feed off your soul fool be livin' ya anger
Now ya lifes in danger

[Verse 7: Lord Infamous]
Evil...
Notice the murderous vocalist
Infamous rippin' up all of your ho shit
Approachin Da Scarecrow'll butchure and
Tearin' up niggas wit double edge
Lyrical thought as they go the lyrical legacy
Let the Lord Infamous light up da melody
Every nigga that try to compare with the
Triple 6 Mafia walkin' to therapy
When you walk throught the wilderness
Be very quiet Lord Infamous might be out stalkin'
I suggest you watch out for the booby traps
Mane cause the Scarecrow is out there only for huntin'
Special thanks to my brother Bill Dunigan
Rest in Peace he taught me bout these mean streets
So therefore nigga you dont wanna come deal with the mafia
We'll drop you deep down beneath
The killa imperial black miracle from the bloody pacific
Scarecrow will flow to the end of infinity
With the style thats mystic

[Verse 8: Juicy J]
Deep when we creep
Take yo last breath
Roll up yo tombstone
Smoke a blunt of death
Beware
The juice'll leave ya fuckin' hoes in terror
And scared of the Mystic Styles of them 3-6 devils
Who eva step up to this click then ya doomed
Cruel with my harpoon
Straight through yo heart fool
Soon I'll have you in tha trance
Swearin hearin' evil chants
Two knifes stuck down in my pants
Bustas do not stand a chance

[Verse 9: DJ Paul]
See Im'ma cold hearted killa like murderer Al Kapone
Strong as thousand mile winds quick to break ya bones
A Glock 19, 95 I cause ya early death
Ya walkin' Triple 6 streets so foo watch ya step
We all about makin' that cheese we gotta stay straight mane
Robbin' and workin' these hoes foo it ain't no thang
I even got virgins servin' for me in some otha nations
Pimpin' so hard that I got locked for some tax evasion
Killers and thieves is all I ever had the pleasure to meet
A rusty ass Tec 9 will make ya hit ya knee
I'm tryin to keep from blastin' off my muthafuckin' balls
By da one in da chamber of da Glock I got in my draws
I got my cap to the side, watchin' my fuckin' back
My dogs across the street in the grass
When I'm sweatin the track
Satan worshipper or thug would be my profile, read my file
I been a mean child for a while within' a Mystic Style
