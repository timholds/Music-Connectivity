Her name is cigarette
And i can't quit
'guess i'm the malboro man
She likes my west and shirt
More than my cowoy boots
I saw her put it on this morning

I was lying in bed
Stealing looks in her silouhette
Smoking a cigarette
We ain't finished yet
You've come a long way baby

I'm a tobaccoman
Not a medicine clown
I walk a mile for your camel

Oh darling put on a film
And make the room that we like to hide in
Uuuh...

Na na nanana na na
No need to talk
And here we go again
Right now, baby well, right now
Couldn't care less
What the people have said
Fire, babe we're on fire
And all i want is one more day

With you

Smoking a cigarette
A little russian roulette
We keep on spinning
What's all this about?
When i thought i was out
You pull me back in

I might not be boyfriend material
But i'm different from the hang out wit
If that's what you are looking for now
The two of us can be a hit

Well baby put on a film
Like we're gonna watch the whole thing
Uuuh...
Na na....
No need to talk
And here we go again
Right now, baby well, right now
Couldn't care less
What the people have said
Fire, babe we're on fire
And all i want is one more day
With you....
