Before I go id like to say a few things. this album was completed on january 15th 1991. By now the war has probably started and a whole bunch of people have probably died out there in the desert over some bullshit. Theres a war goin on right now in my neighborhood but I can't really determine which one is worse..I think the one that we are all fightin is fucked up and thats the war inside out brains you know. but uh I feel bad about all the brothers and sisters gettin pulled right out of their neighborhoods all the citys and small towns in america that go over there and fight for that bullshit. that most of them dont really have anything to do with. So I gotta send peace out to em. Also peace out to all my homies in jail brothers that are dead locked up right here on earth..talkin about the brothers in solidad, san quetin, all the way up to pelicans bay, tracy, chino, and all my homeboys out there in the east coast lockdown facilities. Im talkin about clinton, rikers, jolead, you know every prison in the whold fuckin world man, thats like you know all bullshit you know. they say slavery has been abolished except for the convicted felon yall need to think about that. that lets you know what the fuckin constitution is really about you know. Alot of my homeboys have been locked down
My whole entire career and thats some bullshit. So for them from the Rhyme Syndicate and Ice-T Id like to send this special shout out...Fuck the police, Fuck the FBI, Fuck the DEA, Fuck the CIA, Fuck Tipper Gore, Bush and his cripple bitch this is Ice-T im out of here, told ya you shoulda killed me last year..
