[Intro: Baby Bone]
If this is what you want
You got to push
You made it this far
Now show them what you do

[Verse 1]
How many years did I stay in my room
And I slept half the day, let's say until noon
Turned my Xbox on I'd be playing it soon
Treat my life like a flower that I'm waiting to bloom
Slowly lost all my friends then my girlfriend left
Just about a month later me and her friend slept
Together and then on to the next girl let me
Think I'm having fun, but I still felt empty
Pain bottled up so I went insane
Almost lost this life like forget this game
So I write it all down I expect this day
To be a new beginning got to vent this pain
It takes a lot of patience, can't get anxious
Ripping up these tracks on an every day basis
Trying to launch off so close I can taste it
And when it finally happens it'll be outrageous

[Hook]
This is what I do with my headphones on
This is what I do when I'm in my zone
This is what I do when I write a new song
With a pen and a pad or I type it in my phone
Do it everywhere I go from the house to the lab
Write the words on my mind got a thousand to rap
Didn't think I'd make it when I was small, but I grew
Into the person that I am now this is what I do

[Verse 2]
There's at least half a dozen ways that I ached
Popped so many pills wasn't able to wake
So I sought some help I was taking a break
Had to check myself in before I made a mistake
Looking up at the ceiling every night that I slept
All the fear that I felt I would write and I kept
Every lyric in my mind then I played that song
Every day in my head til I came back strong
Wake up by seven, eight at the latest
Got back in shape and I'm feeling my greatest
Released by the docs so I'm off my hiatus
I'm going all in someone take me to Vegas
Chips are on the table now let the dice roll
When I finish this album I'm reclaiming my soul
No more deciding if I stay or I go
Imma run until I make it all the way and I blow

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
No one's understanding me
Living in a fantasy
No one is a fan of one who can't stand up
Devil won't you dance with me
No one's understanding me
Living in a fantasy
No one is a fan of one who can't stand up
Devil won't you dance with me
Trying to make sense of the cards I was dealt
Started rapping nonsense they were bars that I felt
Then I realized soon I was harming myself
Had to do something fast I was starving for help

[Baby Bone]
"And that's what you are
A starving artist
You're hungry
You got to get out there and feast"

[Kasland]
Do you know what it's like to be that outcast
Time is not your friend and it's running out fast
Can't wait for the ball it's a hundred yard pass
Got to catch up with the pro's if you want to outlast
Other players on the field, got to climb your way up
To the top of the food chain you got to stay up
Better make it on time cause it won't wait up
You only get one shot to claim that you came up
So here I am and here I stand
A stronger, braver, and better man
I'm rebuilding the life that I know I can
And if you're coming with me then take my hand cause

[Hook]

[Outro: Baby Bone]
There's no time to rest
No time to think
There's hardly any time to act
There are quitters, and then there's you
