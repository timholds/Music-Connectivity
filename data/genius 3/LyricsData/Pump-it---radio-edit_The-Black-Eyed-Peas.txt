Ha, ha, haaaa
Pump it
Ha ha haaaa
And pump it (louder) [4x]
Turn up the radio, blast your stereo, right

N****s wanna hate on us
N****s be envious
And I know why they hating on us
Cause our style's so fabulous
I'ma be real on us - nobody got nothing on us
Girls be all on us, from London back down to the US (s, s)
We rockin' this contagious, monkey business outrageous
Just confess, your girl admits that we the s***
F-R-E-S-H we fresh, D-E-F, that's right we def, rock
We definite, B-E-P we reppin' it, so

[Chorus]
Turn it up (turn it up) [3x]
Come on baby just
Pump it (louder) [6x]
And say, oh oh oh oh
Say, oh oh oh oh
Turn up the radio
Blast your stereo right now
This joint is fizzling, it's sizzling, right

Check this out right here:
Dude wanna hate on us
Dude need to ease on up
Dude wanna act on up
But dude get shut like flavour shut down
Chick say she ain't down
But chick backstage when we in town
She like man on drum
She wanna hit n' run
Yeah, that's the scheme, that's who we do, that's who we be
B-L-A-C-K E-Y-E-D P to the E, then the A to the S
When we play you shake your a**
Shake it, shake it, shake it girl
Make sure you don't break it, girl, 'coz we gonna

Damn, (damn) [5x]

Do it, let's get it on, move it
