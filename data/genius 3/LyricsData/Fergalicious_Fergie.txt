[Intro: Will.i.am]
(Four, tres, two, uno)
Listen up y'all, cause this is it
The beat that I'm banging is delicious

[Verse 1: Fergie]
Fergalicious definition make the boys go loco
They want my treasures so they get their pleasures from my photo
You can see me, you can't squeeze me
I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
I got reasons why I tease 'em
Boys just come and go, like seasons

[Pre-Chorus 1: Fergie]
Fergalicious (so delicious)
But, I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that shit is fictitious
I blow kisses (muah!)
That puts them boys on rock, rock
And they be lining down the block
Just to watch what I got (four, tres, two, uno)

[Chorus: Fergie]
It's so delicious (It's hot, hot)
It's so delicious (I put them boys on rock, rock)
It's so delicious (they want a taste of what I got)
I'm Fergalicious (t-t-t-t-t-tasty, tasty)

[Interlude 1: Fergie]
Fergalicious def-
Fergalicious def-
Fergalicious def- (def-, def-, def-, def-...)

[Verse 2: Fergie]
Fergalicious definition make them boys go crazy
They always claim they know me
Coming to me, call me Stacy (Hey Stacy!)
I'm the F to the E-R-G the I, the E
And can't no other lady put it down like me

[Pre-Chorus 2: Fergie]
Fergalicious (so delicious)
My body stay vicious
I be up, in the gym, just working on my fitness
He's my witness (ooh wee)
I put your boy on rock, rock
And he be lining down the block
Just to watch what I got (four, tres, two, uno)

[Chorus: Fergie]
It's so delicious (It's hot, hot)
It's so delicious (I put them boys on rock, rock)
It's so delicious (they want a taste of what I got)
I'm Fergalicious

[Interlude 2: Fergie]
H-h-h-h-hold up! Check it out!

[Bridge: Fergie]
Baby, baby, baby
If you really want me
Honey, get some patience
Maybe then you'll get a taste
Of my tasty, tasty
I'll be laced with lacey
It's so tasty, tasty
It'll make you crazy

[Refrain: Will.i.am]
T to the A to the S-T-E-Y, girl you tasty
T to the A to the S-T-E-Y, girl you tasty
D to the E to the L-I-C-I-O-U-S
To the D, to the E to the
To the, to the... (hit it, Fergie)

[Verse 3: Fergie]
All the time I turn around, brothas gather 'round
Always looking at me up and down, looking at my uhhhhh
I just wanna say it now, I ain't trying to 'round up
Drama little mama, I don't wanna take your man
And I know I'm coming off just a little bit conceited
And I keep on repeating how the boys wanna eat it
But I'm trying to tell, that I can't be treated like clientele
Cause they say she delicious

[Pre-Chorus 1: Fergie]
Fergalicious (so delicious)
But, I ain't promiscuous
And if you was suspicious
All that shit is fictitious
I blow kisses (muah!)
That puts them boys on rock, rock
And they be lining down the block
Just to watch what I got
Four, tres, two, uno!

[Pre-Chorus 2: Fergie]
My body stay vicious
I be up, in the gym, just working on my fitness
He's my witness (ooh wee)
I put your boy on rock, rock
And he be lining down the block
Just to watch what I got (four, tres, two, uno)

[Chorus - Variation : Fergie]
It's so delicious (aye)
It's so delicious (aye)
It's so delicious (aye)
I'm Fergalicious
I'm Fergalicious (t-t-t-t-t-tasty, tasty)
It's so delicious (aye)
It's so delicious (aye)
It's so delicious (aye)
I'm Fergalicious
I'm Fergalicious (t-t-t-t-t-tasty, tasty)
