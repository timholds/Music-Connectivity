[Intro 1: 'War and Peace' sample]
I can still remember the day when my father told that wars always started by the ego and ambitions of one person
"War is the worst thing and unfortunately one of the most
Essential things in the world", he said
My father was definitely a very eccentric person and as a boy
I was too young to understand why my father constantly spoke about how and why wars began especially when we lived in the most beautiful and peaceful place in the world

[Intro 2: Dom Pachino]
Killarm '98
This LP's a banger, yeah

[Hook x1.5: Dom Pachino]
Killarmy in your galaxy, in your continent, in your state, in your city
Take 'em to war, throw your grenades, this shit is gritty
Roll in tanks, carry shanks. while y'all niggas shoot blanks
Live on gun powder, roll black down, dealin' with ranks

[Verse 1: Islord]
Yo, what's the science on ya'll crab ass, niggas out here in this rap shit
Turning this shit into some fucking acting shit
Step into my chamber, I hang ya
Like a stranger out to dry with the mic cord
Wrapped around your neck like 2 times
Designed to leave you breathless
To the point where you passed out
Flat-lined and simple-minded ass cats
Get your fingers snapped back outta place
And dislocated, reaching for that mic device kid I'm nice

[Verse 2: Beretta 9]
Yo, we never timid, break the speed limit
State laws and glass jars and fake malls
Burst pause we take jaws, wise guys who want a prize guy
We snatch mics, pitch strike turn out the light
Mathematics strikes a site make me ball my fist tight
We wild every night, bump shoulders, clubs over
9th Prince started to fight with this analogue
Who lacked the dialogue, bashed his dome with the Smirnoff
Now we squaring off razor sharp face off
Killarmy cut, pushing through like what
Always posted up, double edge leave you with a buck-53 nigga
Fifty three nigga

[Hook: Dom Pachino]

[Verse 3: Dom Pachino]
Terrorist, arch nemesis this is my testament
Eternal life is through the mind, the first element
The first to settle it, the first to pull the metal
The first to defeat the Devil, the first to take it to that level
Feel the volume, adjust the levels and queue the treble
The first and last rebel crush a stone into a pebble
Dunk the track in holy water, baptise
My rhyme is slaughter, ice ventura
Mental explorer my godly aura
Star bright light up your life like night light
Heard you wanna fight, return your ass twice mental and physically

[Verse 4: 9th Prince]
Yo, the last star fighter, Pidgeon-toed soldier
Northern exposure, build with Noah
Asiatic composer, mic killer, black thrower
To retrieve renegade envoy, seek and destroy
Any man that speaks with the fantasies of paranoid
9th Prince trapped in a time zone, at 1751
We bury a 100 corpse in Rome, Prince Saddam is cloned
Lyrical arthritis contagious to the bone
I rhyme on Battlestar Galactica, Terrorist met a contacter
Scar faces are a mass of courage, weak lyricists perish
I cut courage physical frame built to the total package
Razor blades so sharp it'll slice ya eyelashes
Rappers gossip while I speak gospel
Like the teachers of Christ and the apostles
The mind and matter are deep into the science
I smother MC with a pillow, let him die in silence

[Hook 1.5X]

[Outro: 'Spawn'sample]
But always, warriors feel events turning around them
Spiralling, closing in
Some sit and wait too long
Others listen to their instincts and prepare
