If I were you
I'd better watch out
When was the last time
You did anything not for me, or anyone else
Just because, just because

You! Oh, you really should have known
Hey you, you really should have known
Just because, just because

You got the most
But nobody loves you
Nobody has to
Just because
Just because
You! Oh you really should have known
Hey you! I think you really should have known
Just because, just because

Oooh!
Oh! Better watch out!

When we first met
And we passed around gifts
That was a long time ago
And yours didn't fit
Yeah you! Oh you really should have known!
Yeah! You, I think really should have known
Just because, just because

Oooh!
Oh! You better watch out!
