Well, well, well
Seems like it was only yesterday when mama told me
"Don't fall in love with the first girl that comes your way."
She was pretty and nice but I took her advice
And passed her by
Years have passed and I don't know
If love's gonna give me a second try

Well, the look on your face tells me you understand
Could it be your lovelife, like mine, needs a helping hand?

Well, you need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you

(Take It Girl)
I know it ain't fit and proper for a girl to talk this way
But I can't cope with this loneliness
Not one more God damned day
Everyday bringing up your side to keep my hopes afloat
Judging by your silence, boy, you must be in the same boat

Well, you need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
You need love like I do, don't you?
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror
When I'm looking at you

I can't begin to tell the many nights I sat home lonely
Come on, tell me girl, has it ever happened to you?
I'm gonna tell you something and believe me
It ain't no joke
My lovelife is just like a sinking boat

I can understand a person being without money
You can show me the reason for a person to be without love

Listen to me now, I'm a girl and you're a guy. (yes it's true)
Come on let's give love a try. (haha, yeah)

You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you

Finding true love is a dream everybody wants to come true
Can't you see? I
It's up to us to make this dream come true

You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
(Well, well) You need love like I do, don't you?
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror
When I'm looking at you

Ain't it true? Ain't it true? Ain't it true?
Ain't it true? Ain't it true? Yes, it's so true
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well
You need love too

You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
(Hey, hey) You need love like I do, don't you?
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror
When I'm looking at you

You need love like I do, don't you?
I can tell by the way you look, when I'm looking at you
You need love like I do, don't you?
It seems like I'm looking in the mirror
When I'm looking at you

Ain't it true girl?
Well, I'm in love
I need love
And I need you
And I need you too
