To her those quarter tips ain't worth a nickel
If she never makes a dime it's all the same
The only change she wants is from the life I gave her
She didn't come here for the money she came here for the change

She's not here to make a livin' sheâ€™s here to make a life
Now she's gettin' over me beneath the neon lights
And I'm the fool who drove her from a world of apron strings
She didn't come here for the money she came here for the change
[ steel+fiddle ]
The jukebox plays while she waits on her tables
She laughs a lot and never complains
I guess she's happy in her new world without me
But she didn't come here for the money she came here for the change

She's not here to make a livin' she's here to make a life...
She didn't come here for the money she came here for the change
