[Hook: Masego]
You you you
You can't even feel no more
You can't even feel no more
But everybody needs
You you you
You don't really want this violence
I said you don't really want this violence
I swear it ain't me
But, you you you

[Chorus: Masego]
You don't matter 'cause I got love for you
Yeah, I got love
It don't matter 'cause I got love for you

[Verse 1: Boogie]
Insult my intelligence, destroyed the evidence
Stepping in Devil shit, you smell it, it's Heaven sent
Connection was electric, but we all wired
With certain fears of being caught up in the crossfire
I love when you say you off and you finna come
I pray I just don't get involved with your hit and run
You drive me crazy everytime that you give me some
It ain't no safety in your arms, make me get a gun
Really all I wanna do is zooma zoom zoom
Make you shake your rump when I shoot through
Ain't no full moon
You was doing all that "woofing" shit like too soon
Make me "choo choo", lose my train of thought like "who you?"
You you, you get the portrait so I can see what you paint me as
Think that my current darkness was born in my shady past
Think that that minor fall only got me that major bag
Only been saying that just to see what you been aiming at
'Cause I don't think you know that

[Hook: Masego]
You can't even feel no more
You can't even feel no more
But everybody needs
You you you
You don't really want this violence
I said you don't really want this violence
I swear it ain't me
But, you you you

[Verse 2: Boogie]
I guess it's back to seeing liquor mixed with agony
Steady attacking me, I live to be your casualty
Some type of strategy, you sleeping with your back to me
You text me deadly words that seem to kill my battery
And don't be asking what I'm on when you know you doing wrong
When I put you in a song, but ain't tryna get you known
Be wasting my time, time and time in
Don't be telling me you home when you know you not alone
I been feeling like I'm going, like you shot me in my dome
Either way, it's a crime (violence, violence)
Yo, yo, the lost morals of my generation
Why we need heartbreak for inspiration?
Though we on different pages
Like don't be telling me you five minutes out when you know that I'm waiting
Don't be pulling up then turning off your notifications
Cause I see

[Hook: Masego]
You can't even feel no more
You can't even feel no more
But everybody needs
You you you
You don't really want this violence
I said you don't really want this violence
I swear it ain't me
But, you you you
