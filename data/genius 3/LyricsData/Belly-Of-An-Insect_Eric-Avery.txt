A warm dark time
In earths shadow
Iâ€™ve been walking over
Ground thats been burnt
Carry my blood away
Carry my blood away
Carry my blood away
In the belly of an insect
In the belly of an insect
In the belly of an insect
In the belly of an insect

How stupid have I been?
Sometimes I wonder
Over the years
Have I been learning anything?
Why do I still keep believing
Those moments of fleeting
Perfection, that feel somehow magical
Just stay waiting by the wayside
Glowing and patient
All stays possible, retrievable
No one ever leaves this ring undefeated
No one ever leaves this ring

I never said I was good
I never said I was God
I never said I was good
Only that you make me better

Stick my dirty feet into the ground
And raise my green hands to the sky
And carry my blood away
In the belly of an insect
