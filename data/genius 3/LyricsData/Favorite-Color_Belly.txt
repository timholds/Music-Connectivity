[Verse 1]
Tryna find the words, y’all fucked around and hit the final nerve
I heard you done provoked my primal urge, I’m on the verge
I’m on a purge, fuck the world will be my dying words
Then I emerge from the ashes like a fire bird
Talking birds, boy I had ‘em by the dinner plate
Got ‘em out of state, used to put ‘em on the interstate
Born to lose, made to win, even angels sin
And when it come to money, loyalty is paper thin
You talk to police and plus you cuff hoes
You might just catch a booger from the snub nose
I’m down in Florida about to fill up the order
Fill up the fuel and send a mule to the border

[Pre-Hook]
Informer, watch out for the informer
Informer, watch out for the informer
[?] stuck ‘em while you passing recorders
Informer, watch out for the informer

[Hook]
Sip another pill, skip another meal
Your reality isn’t half as real
Favorite color blue, that’s because of you
It reminds me of how you made me feel
It reminds me of how you made me feel
It reminds me of how you made me feel
Favorite color blue, that’s because of you
It reminds me of how you made me feel

[Post-Hook]
On my block niggas walk around with the truth revealed
Who conceals, who can feel, shoot to kill
Uh, shoot to kill
Uh, who can feel?

[Verse 2]
Does god resent me?
Lord forgive me
My life’s a gamble with the odds against me
My heart is empty
All this greed, all this envy
It’s when they lost ‘em, look what it cost me
Just tryna shake these demons off me
I hope you know Jesus if you cross me
My shit’s cerebral, no palsy, the soul haunts me
You can smell poor seeping out my pores
Sleeping on the floor with my feet against the door
Back was more than kind of sore
Cracked my spinal cord
Might’ve been from the pills, I guess that’s an either or
Dumb, I think numb ‘cause I know pain
I think love killed us like Cobain
Ten years out the dope game, I still smell like cocaine
Still dream ‘bout them whole things, that Lois Lane
My road changed from days I used to roll chain
I always knew the bigger picture had a gold frame

[Pre-Hook]
Informer, watch out for the informer
Informer, watch out for the informer
[?] stuck ‘em while you passing recorders
Informer, watch out for the informer

[Hook]
Sip another pill, skip another meal
Your reality isn’t half as real
Favorite color blue, that’s because of you
It reminds me of how you made me feel
It reminds me of how you made me feel
It reminds me of how you made me feel
My favorite color blue, that’s because of you
It reminds me of how you made me feel

[Post-Hook]
On my block niggas walk around with the truth revealed
Who conceals, who can feel, shoot to kill
Uh, shoot to kill
Uh, who can feel?
