Nothing lives long
Only the earth and the mountains

Feel like I'm all flesh and no bone
I'm not the shapes that I'm shown
Hope I get it right tomorrow

I see the hillsides
Burning in flames
Everything's gray
Nothing remains on
Places I loved
Nothing's green, nothing grows
Everything burned
Everything was
