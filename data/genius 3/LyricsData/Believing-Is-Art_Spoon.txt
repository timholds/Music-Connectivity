[Verse 1]
Things everybody would say
Believing is hard
Believing is art
Things everybody should know
The end will come slow
And love breaks your heart
So welcome to the north side
Where you will se what it means to be standing in line
It's not so out of the way
Just under the east and one stop away
I said that this is a call
Yeah it might be a call
If the world could sit tight for one night
Get out of the car at the corner of nine
Where they take everything and just spit it all out
I'm staying up late at night
To take apart what I said
To make it all sound alright
Waiting now and taking my time
Because I've seen what it means to be standing on line

[Chorus]
This is a call yeah it might be a call
And the world is alright and alright
Taking your time and I'm standing on line
It depends it depends and it comes back again
Yes

[Verse 2]
They've got my number they've got me alright
They know my number they've got me alright
Think about it a while
The end ain't that bad
Take out the trash with one hand
It falls apart like a band
Just hold onto it tight

[Chorus]
This is a call it ain't mine not at all
And the world can sit tight and alright
Taking your time and get right back online
It depends it depends and it comes back again

[Outro]
Yes things that everybody would say
Believing is hard
Believing is art
Things everybody should know
The end will come slow
And love breaks your heart
