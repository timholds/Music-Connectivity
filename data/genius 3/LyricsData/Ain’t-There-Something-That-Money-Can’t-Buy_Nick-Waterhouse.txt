Money can change from hand to hand
My oh my, the way it changes plans

Well, why oh why, oh, tell me why
Ain't there something that money can't buy?

Oh, money
Money
Money
Yeah, money

Yeah, money can buy you silks and sable
Force religion, fame and fable
Love is there, willing and able
Long as the cash is solid and stable

Why oh why, oh, tell me why
Ain't there something that money can't buy?

Oh, money
Money
Well, money
Yeah, money

Money can change from hand to hand
My oh my, the way it changes plans

Well, why oh why, oh, tell me why
Ain't there something that money can't buy?

Oh, money
Oh, money
Money
Yeah, money
