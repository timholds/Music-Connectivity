(flava)
Nobody wants blood to be spilt
It's all about the music
Love writes hits
The mics they get used
When people write lyrics for opinions of the critics
That makes the world spin so
(rocky B)
Lightening don't strike in the same place twice
Fight to death call it suicide
I'm a warrior, a death match courier
Sorry now you're gonna be sorrier
Wanna hate what ya don't understand
Acting bait coz I'm fightin' your clan
Iron fist when I tighten my hand
So enlighten your mans
Brighten the stands
Cos you're hiding and prang
Your breaders ain't killing me
Rocksimus who's killing me
Blazin' up caught chilling
Coming back like a trilogy G
You and your boys wanna deal with me
You ain't feelin me
You got beef with me
You got cheek to be starting beef
Coz ya can't ride beats with me
You and your boys try hatin' me
But the pain's gettin shared out equally
That's how it's done

(chorus)
Nobody wants blood to be spilt
It's all about the music
Love writes hits
The mics they get used
When people write lyrics for opinions of the critics
That makes the world spin so
Nobody wants blood to be spilt
It's all about the music
Love writes hits
The mics they get used
When people write lyrics for opinions of the critics
That makes the world spin so
( Strider)
Steppin' to me it's a fact you'll get bored
I'm possessed like a demon
As I draw for my sword
Engraved writing on it sayin' the snipers the lord
The best warrior in the land countries in the world
I've got powers like a god
I control the sky
Things I'll do to you
Would even make the friggin devil cry
I swing swords like soul calibre
A legend like Excalibur
Blood thirsty for the next challenger
(Spike-e)
Who dares wins when you're playin my game
Chillin' on rooftops kids who are playin'
Gonna draw for swords
And the lyric that I gain gonna buss the door
In the pouring rain
(flava)
Yo yo
Guess who's next
Draw swords when I'm on it
I blow heads abroad
I blow lost profit
You've never heard before
Brain cells lock it
Pocket knives endure
But you wish you never
Coz I'm clever with these lyrics
Forever I'm gonna run this
(Nobody wants blood to be spilt coz)
Flava this Flava that but who done this
You know me I'm the same old same old G

Nobody wants blood to be spilt
It's all about the music
Love writes hits
The mics they get used
When people write lyrics for opinions of the critics
That makes the world spin so
Nobody wants blood to be spilt
It's all about the music
Love writes hits
The mics they get used
When people write lyrics for opinions of the critics
That makes the world spin so
(freek)
Freeze, as I enter your ends
Anytime anywhere
When ur started to stare
Fightin' ya now we'll be fightin' ya there
Coz it's all about the music
Give it ten out of ten
I'll thrive on your blood
Hungry for your skin
Chop up your bones
And put you in my tin
I'm the brother of the devil
And the master of Satan
I'm the feeling in your body
And I'm gonna make you cringe
(kenzie)
Don't watch me battle
My duel a cold hearted bout
Hear the screams as you shout
While you're flat on your back
You know there's no turnin' back
You wanna piece of me
Askin 4 beef wid me
Ain't no sequel to me
So take a shot at me
You gonna make it you best
You try to slash my chest
I'm badder than the rest
Coz you know I'll defend
Clash straight to the end
Next contender
Try to contend my arena
Step into my surroundings
No emotions
No commotions
There is no feelings
I'm the favourite as well ya know
Coz there's no holds barred
And anything will go
(rocky B)
Nobody wants it
Nobody wants it
(kenzie)
Next contender, try to contend
(rocky B)
Nobody wants it
Nobody wants it
