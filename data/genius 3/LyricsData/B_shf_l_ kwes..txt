Falling over, bending backwards
My mind's fractured of all the things you do
Looking over, feeling awkward
I'm over thinking, time is falling through
A continent UNCOUNTABLE... for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
Getting under myself, looking forwards
Will do my utmost, to impress you
Maybe next morning, buy a cream ...
It's not a flying calendar... have to do
A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful

A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
I'm already on to you, thought I once proved
You may think what I say isn't true
I understand, you may miss the truth
I'm ...take it to you, if a... saying to you
So ...bring it back to you
A continent .uncountable.for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
A continent ...for the lack of mental in my bones
