(Mike)
Sitting here thinking about you
And all the things we used to do
I never thought that I would lose you
Cause you were always my boo
Sitting here wondering where we
Wonderin where we went wrong
Cause now I'm here all alone
Wishing you'd come back home, So tell me

Why, why, why'd you have to go away
Got me missing you everyday
Baby tell me why, why, why'd you have to go away
Got me missing you everyday
Everyday I'm missing you

I don't understand why you left, baby what didn't I do?
Wasn't I always there for you and wasn't I good to you?
How was I to know something was wrong
Baby I can't read minds
All you had to do was tell me
But you kept it all inside

Tell me why, why, why'd you have to go away got me missing you everyday
Baby, tell me why, why, why'd you have to go away got me missing you everyday
Everyday I'm missing you

Girl I'll never find another
Another one to take your place
Cause you were so, so good to me baby
And you kept the smile upon my face
And I'm on my bended knee and I'm crying, crying won't you come back to me
To me cause you mean the world to me

Why, why, why'd you have to go away got me missing you everyday
Oh tell me why, why, why'd you have to go away got me missing you everyday
I'm missing you
Why, why, go away everyday
Why, why, go away everyday I'm missing you
Why, why, go away everyday
