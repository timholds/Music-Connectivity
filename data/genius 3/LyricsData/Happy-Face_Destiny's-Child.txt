Ah-ah, ah ah-ah, ah ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah....

I woke up this morning, the sunshine was shining
I put on my happy face
I'm living, I'm able, I'm breathing, I'm grateful
To put on my happy face

Woke up and realized this world's not so bad after all
Looked at it through a child's eyes, and I saw these beautiful
Things that you never think about
Like the ocean, moonlight, stars and clouds
It's amazing how we don't appreciate our blessings
There's plenty of people who don't like me
But since there are more who love me and I love myself
Sometimes, it gets tough, it gets tough
But I can't give up, can't give up
Just take a deep breath, close my eyes
Feel the love and give a smile

I woke up this morning, the sunshine was shining
I put on my happy face
I'm living, I'm able, I'm breathing, I'm grateful
To put on my happy face

I woke up this morning, the sunshine was shining
I put on my happy face
I'm living, I'm able, I'm breathing, I'm grateful
To put on my happy face

It's me, I just wanna be happy
Uh, just be happy, uh, just be happy
Today is the day I am willing to say
I will put all the past behind me, no more enemies
Ready cause (ready cause)
I'm living in this world (living in this world)
I wanna make a change (wanna make a change)
Gonna make a change (gonna make a change)
Put on my happy face

I woke up this morning, the sunshine was shining
I put on my happy face
I'm living, I'm able, I'm breathing, I'm grateful
To put on my happy face

I woke up this morning, the sunshine was shining
I put on my happy face
I'm living, I'm able, I'm breathing, I'm grateful
To put on my happy face

Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be okay
Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be alright, everything's gonna be alright
Everything's gonna be alright, everything's gonna be okay

I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying
I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying, I'm flying

Flying, flying....
