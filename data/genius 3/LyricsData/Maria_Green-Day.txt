Billie Joe, it certainly is exciting to meet you here at the recording studio, right after you've just made your very first record! How does it feel?
[BILLIE JOE ARMSTRONG]
Hmmm... Wonderful!

[Verse 1]
She smashed the radio with the board of education
Turned up the static left of the state of the nation
Turn on the flame, step on the gas
Burning the flag at half mast
She's the rebel forgotten son
An export of the revolution

[Verse 2]
She is the first voice of the last one's in the line
She'll drag the weights to keep the vendetta alive
Bring in the head of the government
The dog ate the document
Someone shot the president
And no one knows where Maria went!

[Chorus]
Maria!
Maria!
Maria!
Where did ya go?

[Verse 3]
Be careful what you're offering
Your breath lacks the conviction
Drawing a line in the dirt
Because the last decision is no!
It's No!

[Verse 1] + [Chorus x2]
