She's dressed to kill in a dress he bought her
She wouldn't care if he walked in and caught her
She's come to dance a dance or two
And do no tellin' what by the time the night is through

She found out the hard way about him
She's out to find out how she'll do without him
Her hands are shakin', her heart's pounding
By the way she's drinking his memory's drowin'

She's not the cheatin' kind
She's been cheated one too many times
Oh, she's never fooled around
'Cause he's still lyin' she's through cryin'
She's not foolin' now

She walks by and every head turns
You can see how hot her fire burns
He didn't know what a good thing he had
It's too late and that's too bad

She's not the cheatin' kind
She's been cheated one too many times
Oh, she's never fooled around
'Cause he's still lyin' she's through cryin'
She's not foolin' now

She's not the cheatin' kind
She's been cheated one too many times
Oh, she's never fooled around
'Cause he's still lyin' she's through cryin'
She's not foolin' now

She's not the cheatin' kind
She's been cheated one too many times
Oh, she's never fooled around
'Cause he's still lyin' she's through cryin'
She's not foolin' now
