[Chorus]
Yeah, I smoke pot
Yeah, I love peace
But I don't give a fuck
I ain't no hippy
Yeah, I smoke pot (do it)
Yeah, I love peace (do it)
But I don't give a fuck (do it)
I ain't no hippy (ah)
Yeah, I smoke pot
Yeah, I love peace
But I don't give a fuck (do it)
I ain't no hippy (do it)
Yeah, I smoke pot (do it)
Yeah, I love peace (do it)
But I don't give a fuck (ah)
I ain't no hippy
(Do it)

[Bridge]
(I understand) feel like I am one with the universe
(I understand)  and all I need is right here
(I understand)  feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me

[Verse 1]
(I understand) why there is a sun?
And how do birds fly?
And why there is a moon
Way up in the sky?
Why there is trees? (Do it)
And what the fuck is love? (Do it)
And what is flying saucers
Watching from above?
(Yo, fuck, man)

[Bridge]
Feel like I am one with the universe
And all I need is right here
Feel like I am part of the universe
And it's part of me

[Verse 2]
Yo, sing about love
Love is what you need
Loving what you sing
And loving smoking weed
(Weed, weed, weed, weed)
Sing about peace
Being high and free
So if you don't give a fuck, sing along with me

[Chorus]
Yeah, I smoke pot (smoke pot)
Yeah, I love peace (love peace)
But I don't give a fuck (give a fuck)
I ain't no hippy (fuck)

[Verse 3]
(I understand) why there is a sky?
And why do pigs run?
And why them motherfuckers
Putting bullets in they gun?
Violence is king, but peace is the way
Someday weâ€™re gonna see it
So here's what I'm saying

[Outro]
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
Peace mu'fucker (do it)
So peace mu'fucker (do it)
Why they put the dick in the pussy?
Fuck you
