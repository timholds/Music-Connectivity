[Verse 1: Bigz]
Like ayy, look who just stepped in the door
You can tell by the aura I'm fresh from a tour
Christian Dior from the neck to the floor
So the swag's still dripping, check the sweat from the pores
Ain't no need to check my wind skills
The boy stay fresh like he slept in clingfilm
Yeah, the mink's real, nigga, this is made to fit
Kanye shit, switching on my Taylor Swift
We're doing Gs on the Visa
D&G [?] like breezer with chiefer
Ps are the feature, your eyes got silly clouds
I shine bright, my eyes? Wizzy Wow
I'm on my sky shit, Bigz still bragging, fam
Cause I do fly kicks sicker than Jackie Chan
So casually there's no half-stepping
I'm in another galaxy, go ask [?]

[Hook: Wizzy Wow]
I'm fresh, I'm fly
Tints on my shades so you can't see my eyes
Might see me on the road but I walk in the sky, float in the sky
The sway's so stick, stay close to your wife
Swooosh! You ain't fresh like me
And none of you boys are fresh like me
Swooosh! You ain't fresh like me
And none of you boys are fresh like me

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
Uh, look, you niggas ain't fresh like me
I don't even do white tees, aged four got me in Y3s
With stripes like these, I Dragonball the Z, bruh
It's such a melody how the piano got the keys touched
So if you got the balls, hit my wicket, blud
Just becuh Ralph got me looking like a cricketer
When you say you're gonna drop it out, I'mma pick it up
When I drop bags, it ain't the type that needs zipping up
The game's in my reach, my name on my sleeve
Now I'm just tryna make Alexandra my queen
I'll spend in a day a fortnight on two weeks
Let me explain, it's pure hype, you'll see
I must've been conceived in the sky, why?
Becuh I was born fly, truthfully
I'm forever getting mine
Pinnochio nose, niggas never telling lies

[Hook: Wizzy Wow]
I'm fresh, I'm fly
Tints on my shades so you can't see my eyes
Might see me on the road but I walk in the sky, float in the sky
The sway's so stick, stay close to your wife
Swooosh! You ain't fresh like me
And none of you boys are fresh like me
Swooosh! You ain't fresh like me
And none of you boys are fresh like me

[Verse 3: Scorcher]
I navigate, back awake
Rucksack of papes, skywalk, gravitate, I bought
One something I like, then went and got five more
Something like Ronnie O'S with the white ball
Fresh from the crep to the eyeball
Splash, kinda like I leapt off a dive board
Mother-f haters, I'mma get papers
I'm a Specsaver, every day I ball
You wanna war on the road and be a right fool?
Just call me the coach, I make the right call
Darg, it's all in the flow, I let the vibe talk
Majors keep calling the phone, I tell em "try more"
I tell em "come again proper"
Cause I'm a trap nigga, double money getting shotta
Before my gang rap, I was hustling for proper
Bigz, tell them niggas in the bossa, cut 'em with the lopper

[Hook: Wizzy Wow]
I'm fresh, I'm fly
Tints on my shades so you can't see my eyes
Might see me on the road but I walk in the sky, float in the sky
The sway's so stick, stay close to your wife
Swooosh! You ain't fresh like me
And none of you boys are fresh like me
Swooosh! You ain't fresh like me
And none of you boys are fresh like me
