[Verse 1]
Go slow, we live in the haze of
Stains on the sheets like ink on the pages
It's for show, our hearts in our chests
We all try our best, even just for the children
You know it's all in your head
When your dreams fall apart as you try to build them

[Chorus]
We fall in love
With the same old lie, with the same old lie
We fall in love
With the same old lie, with the same old lie

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, it looks like it feels
And it's no big deal, you don't find it funny
It's fine
You walk down the line
You need a straight face to keep all the money

[Pre-Chorus]
I bend over backwards to show you I mean it, people
Please, believe me
Won't you hear what I put in your ear, 'cause I say it again 'till it really hits home (really hits home)

[Chorus]
We fall in love
With the same old lie, with the same old lie
We fall in love
With the same old lie, with the same old lie

[Outro]
We fall in love
We fall in love
