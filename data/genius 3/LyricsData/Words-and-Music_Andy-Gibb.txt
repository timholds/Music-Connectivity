[Verse 1:]
Words and music make a song
For our hearts to sing along
Like a choir within the air
There'll be music everywhere

A bitter tear across your cheek
A smile from you is all I need
We'll give them 'cause to breathe the air
There'll be lovers everywhere

[Chorus:]
I'll be your singer and your song
For all the love you've brought along
I'll be your day
I'll be your night
I'll see that everything's all right

I'll turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
I'll make the raindrops turn to snow

And then everyone will know
That we're in love
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2:]
And when the morning brings its light
And Mister Moonlight says goodbye
My hand is shaking when you smile

You make me feel just like a child
My mind is searching for a way
So that you won't have to say

You've got to go
And can't come back
But I can't think you'd make me sad

[Chorus:]
I'll be your singer and your song
For all the love you've brought along
I'll be your day
I'll be your night
I'll see that everything's all right

I'll turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command
I'll make the raindrops turn to snow
And then everyone will now
That we're in love

[Bridge:]
(Take away the pain in me)
I'll be your singer and your song
(Soon you'll see a change in me)
For all the love you've brought along
(What's the point of going on)

[Chorus:]
I'll be your day
I'll be your night
(The story ends, the feeling's gone)
I'll see that everything's all right
I'll turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command

I'll make the raindrops turn to snow
And then everyone will know
That we're in love

(The story ends, the feeling's gone)
I'll see that everything's all right
I'll turn the ocean into sand
Like my heart at your command

I'll make the raindrops turn to snow
And then everyone will know
That we're in love
