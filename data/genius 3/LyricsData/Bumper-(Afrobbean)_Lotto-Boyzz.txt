[Intro: Ash]
AYD, Are You Dumb Boy?

[Pre-Chorus: Ash]
See, my money never waits
She, tell me that I never make time for her
She, wants me out of this place
Money, money but she wanna see something from me
And, baby girl I know that I'm annoying
But you ain't gotta worry, put your trust in me
And baby girl don't worry bout your boyfriend (your boyfriend, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah)

[Chorus: Ash]
Wah di rass, wah di bumba (oh yeah)
This girl got a bumper (oh yeah)
And gyal I ask for my number
But baby I got my eyes on you (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Wah di rass, wah di bumba (oh yeah)
This girl got a bumper (oh yeah)
And gyal I ask for my number
But baby I got my eyes on you

[Verse 1: Lucas]
She classy with a little bit of flavour
She say she coming round, I'll see you later
Forget about your man at home
Babygirl I'm doing you a favour
Hold it, control it
Take time, baby go slowly
Call me whenever you feel lonely
I can be your lover and your homie
She call me Papi, like I'm her daddy
I be giving you something you never had
Hands on your body complete the task
Hands on your body make you go nasty (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Slow wine if you don't mind (oh yeah, yeah)
Oh my, gyal it's show time (oh yeah, yeah)
Offline, not been online lately
So fine, you can hold my baby

[Chorus: Ash]
See, my money never waits
She, tell me that I never make time for her
She, wants me out of this place
Money, money but she wanna see something from me
And, babygirl I know that I'm annoying
But you ain't gotta worry, put your trust in me
And babygirl don't worry bout your boyfriend (your boyfriend, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Chorus: Lucas]
Wah di rass, wah di bumbo (oh yeah)
