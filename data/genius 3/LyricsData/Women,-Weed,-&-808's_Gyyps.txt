[Hook: Gyyps]
Scheming through the 818
Might've had too much to drink
Women, weed, & 808's
Feeling like I'll never leave
Scheming through, scheming through
Might've had too much to drink
Women, weed & 808's
Women, weed & 808's

Scheming through, scheming through
Scheming through, scheming through

[Verse 1: Gyyps]
Cause I really been fighting with the bitch
And I really been hyping up the sitch
Everybody want to try to listen in
I'm saying what I want to say, I can
And this bitch been fucking with my friends
Then I found out we was never friends
Yeah, he go on and on again
With the same old shit it's all pretend
But y'all know me, and this my season
Live back east, live at the beach
And show you where the west coast at, no trench coat
Saying that the dress code's whack at the prep school (aw yeah)
Imma let fools on the internet drool
When I get shoes, they gon' bet against you
[?], nothing like next dude
If you step to me imma hit you with a step stool. Cool?

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Gyyps]
Rolling Stone cover but I won't rush it
Take it slow, think I'm guapping I got no budget
But I got hopes, never sleeping so my nose running
I feel the cold from the people, call 'em soul crushers
And she don't love me but she love my mama
(scheming through, scheming through)
She won't fuck me in my own apartment
(scheming through, scheming through)
I keep messing up the love I've gotten
(scheming through, scheming through)
I don't know myself I'm something like my father
(scheming through)

[Bridge: Gyyps]
In that off-white Cadillac
I just want to ride with my friends
In that off-white Cadillac
Imma give my mama the Benz
In that off-white Cadillac, I'm just being honest, man
I don't want to see you again
In that off-white Cadillac
Off-white Cadillac
