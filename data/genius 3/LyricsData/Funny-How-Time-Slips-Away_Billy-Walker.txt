Well hello there my it's been a long long time
How am I doin' oh I guess that I'm doin' fine
It's been so long now and it seems that it was only yesterday
Gee ain't it funny how time slips away
How's your new love I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him that you'd love him till the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me it seems like just the other day
Gee ain't it funny how time slips away
Gotta go now guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though never know when I'll be back in town
But remember what I tell you that in time you're gonna pay
And it's surprising how time slips away
