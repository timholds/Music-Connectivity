[Chorus]
Candy flip, Tab of acid
Take a trip, Now I'm back
This my shit pack it pass it
With my clique, just imagine
Candy flip, Laffy taffy
Level headed, I'm an addict
I'm the shit. I'm up off a candy flip

[Verse 1: Gyyps]
Sabbath, steely, Zeppelin, credence
Steven Tyler, ACDC
Making out with Miley Cyrus
Sorry Patrick, grab her privates
Breakfast at McDonald's
City overpopulated
Meal cost me a dollar
Where they fuck they get this bacon
Where the fuck the lobbyist
Where the fuck is my confidence
No harmony and its harming me
Sound of roosters alarming me
Brain damage memory loss
See a fan, inside target he
Ask me what I'm on I'll just
Tell him that I'm on homie

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Felly]
Bobby Dylan, 311
Mista Marley, Johnny Legend
Slightly Stoopid keep me steppin
Roll with lucy at coachella
This that new shit for my fellas
Young frank lucas polo sweatas
Thought I told y'all this my era
Yall gone grow up like your parents
That's generic
Might pull up with the top down careless
L rides with the cops round scary
Themem thighs got me locked down starrin, sippin Barry's
Need a tooth fairy, candy flip got the sweet tooth clearly
Black jumpsuit  creep through clearin my throat
Out in the streets it's called murda you know, that's why these trees stuffed in my coat
See what I seen you might fuckin have you a stroke (woah)
Red wine rest in peace Rob snow
Good times they come and they go
Remember me low key, 10th grade with the Yoshi
Bulking up with the protein
Little girl so she bad but she lowkey

I be Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne
They call me Dwayne, Dwayne, Dwayne
I'm Dwayne, Dwayne
I said I'm Dwayne, Dwayne

[Chorus x2]
