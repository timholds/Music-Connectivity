[Intro:]
That Hood Fame, you heard shawty?

[Hook:]
Hey what's your name shawty? Jump-jump-jump in, lets ride
Let's play some games shawty, do a couple freaky things you like
Tell me your (?), what's your number
You like my rhymes, maybe this summer we can chill
Hey and roll out

[Verse 1:]
I know you like the way I rhyme and I'm kicking this
Old, slow, dramatic, hypnotize my (?)ship
It's for the shawtys with the 'Lacs and them grills
On the floor, breaking they backs for them meals
Hit me up, a two way
I'm talking trips to A-town, holla U-A
And we can ride a bit
Talking that butt (?) and slidin' it
Bumpin' that slow DJ Screw, O-G Ron, Chamillion too
She know I'm still the best, she like to spell my name
She heard I'm just a playa, but she still chose me man
She wanna roll with me, let me in and blow on it
Anywhere she'll go with me, wanna say yes like clover tree (?)
Hey, I'm the flyest nigga 'round, shit is going down
Shawty feel me deep up in her making freaky sounds
Put her to sleep, throw my fit on and (?) out
Maybe this summer we can chill and just roll out

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Hey what's your name shawty? Jump-jump-jump in, lets ride
I got a room just for two with some Cris inside
Hey, we can pour up and sip just a little
Hey, you can slow motion dip just a little
It's for a playa right, I'm down for what you like
I'm on a mission, free me baby, shawty show me right
Hey, I'm a pro at it, hey girl you banging too
We good at doin-doin-doin-doin what we do
I know you hot ma, ready to drop somethin'
Live like you pop somethin'
Over the top come
I set the standard high above all these other niggas
You ain't ashamed to tell your girls that you lovin' this
I got you coming back, screaming you want more
Live on camera, it's my own personal freak show
Put you to sleep, throw my fit on and (?) out
Maybe this summer we can chill and just roll out

[Hook:]
