[Verse 1]
Every time the Titans pushed over
All the punks are thick on the ground
But in the bike lane, you think it over
Turn in your tank and turn around

[Chorus]
Idiot driver, idiot drive
She swears that I know her
Why don't you turn over?

[Verse 2]
Enterprise, yeah, man, I know what it's like
Way to get from A to B
When they can't take it, slow down the harbor
Go get the car keys, play the blues
Set, new way, set, three, four
Set, one, two, three, four
She's waking up right now with him
It just makes me sick
Yeah because the highway is your girlfriend
And it goes by quick, it goes

[Chorus]
Idiot driver, idiot drive
I'm stuck all alone and I want to turn over
