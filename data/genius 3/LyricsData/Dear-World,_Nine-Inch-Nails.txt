[Intro]
Yes, everyone seems to be asleep

[Verse 1]
Hey look, you didn't even know this
Couldn't even tell
Just when it started... happening
Maybe just as well
After all, everything is getting unfamiliar now
Trajectory in decline
And we become obsolete
A frame at a time

[Chorus]
I'm locked inside here
Have to stay
With people who aren't here
All the way
Pictures and faces
On display
With people who aren't here
All the way (all the way)
All the way (all the way)
All the way (all the way)

[Bridge]
It is coming, and you didn't even notice, yeah you didn't even notice... (you were missing)

[Verse 2]

Dear world,
I am leaving


I can hardly recognize you anymore
Because I can't recognize who I have been


And yet I remain certain



There is an answer in you
You go on spoiling


I feel like I have lived so long sometimes
Hey look, it's happening


Run out of things to try to do
Without me you didn't even notice


I can't concentrate my way out
Of course it's been happening all along



Permanent intervals


What about...?
As you become obsolete, who are you?


I begin to go through another of that we have been
Oh this place...



I can't concentrate


I have been entirely patient
But I know I can't trust myself with this again


No, no, not this time


[Chorus]
I'm locked inside here
Have to stay
With people who aren't here
All the way
Pictures and faces
On display
With people who aren't here
All the way (all the way)
All the way (all the way)
All the way (all the way)

[Outro]
Yes, everyone seems to be asleep
