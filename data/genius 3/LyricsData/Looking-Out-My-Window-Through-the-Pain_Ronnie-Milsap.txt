I watched from the window as she slipped from the house
Once again she's leaving but Lord she's not to blame
This morning a mem'ry phoned her and he's a habit she can't break
So till she returns I'll wait for her looking out my window through the pain

The devil drove the taxi that carried her away
And it hurts to know she's still hung up on some guy from yesterday
Once again, she's chasing mem'ries and I'm losing everything
But Lord, I love her so, I'll wait for her looking out my window through the pain

I'll pick up her pieces when he lays her down again
With love and forgiveness I'll give her reasons to stay
Then I close my eyes pretending maybe someday she'll change
And when I won't be left lonely looking out my window through the pain

The devil drove the taxi that carried her away
And it hurts to know she's still hung up on some guy from yesterday
Once again, she's chasing mem'ries and I'm losing everything
But Lord, I love her so, I'll wait for her looking out my window through the pain...
