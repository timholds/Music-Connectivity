It doesn't matter if I don't get to keep you
It doesn't matter if I live or die
It doesn't matter that your boyfriend left you
And that summer only lasted one day
I'm in the mirror with the Rickenbacker twelve string
My good friend who can really understand
But if he once got relationship problems
I would surely go on with you, but why wouldn't I?
It doesn't matter if I don't get to keep you
It doesn't matter if I live or die
I'm in the mirror with my bestfriend twelve string
The day that you will love me, will never arrive
We were almost it
We almost went somewhere
Charm of the teardown left behind
Not to be who I am
Takes a lot of work this time
To lock it within back up inside
Doesn't matter if I don't get to keep you
Doesn't matter if I live or die
I'm in the mirror with my bestfriends twelve string
Try to worship sixties california
But no not so contemporary ways
Everybodies got their heart in a wheelchair
And now I finally come up for air
The lazy eye of the sun come such slowly
And a million candle-look cities disappear
Doesn't matter if I don't get to keep you
It doesn't matter if I live or die
Doesn't matter if your boyfriend left you
Aaaahh, Aaaah
But it doesn't matter that I love your smile
