Don't talk, pour me another one
So warm, throat is burning up
My feet light up in the dark

Four drinks gone, never stop

Tomorrow memory gone
Lost count after the last shot
I'm off this world just a little while
Getting loose to the same song

And if you want something from me
Ask me tomorrow
And if you want something from me
Ask me tomorrow

Feeling good, feeling fresh
Feeling fly, I'm so alive
Is it real, is it fake
Do I care or do I mind
Got my drink, got my glass
In my hand, it is the time
I ain't got no thoughts to borrow
You better ask me tomorrow

Feeling good, feeling fresh
Feeling fly, I'm so alive
Is it real, is it fake
Do I care or do I mind
Got my drink, got my glass
In my hand, it is the time
I ain't got no thoughts to borrow
You better ask me tomorrow

Second verse, here comes another one
Pour it up, sir, give me some
I ain't drunk, I'm just having fun'
Now let me tell you where I'm coming from

I can get up in this vibe
All day, all night, you know
I'm off this world just a little while
Getting loose to the same song

And if you want something from me
Ask me tomorrow
And if you want something from me
Ask me tomorrow

Feeling good, feeling fresh
Feeling fly, I'm so alive
Is it real, is it fake
Do I care or do I mind
Got my drink, got my glass
In my hand, it is the time
I ain't got no thoughts to borrow
You better ask me tomorrow

Feeling good, feeling fresh
Feeling fly, I'm so alive
Is it real, is it fake
Do I care or do I mind
Got my drink, got my glass
In my hand, it is the time
I ain't got no thoughts to borrow
You better ask me tomorrow

You better ask me, ask me tomorrow
You better ask me, ask me tomorrow
You better ask me, ask me tomorrow
You better ask me, ask me tomorrow

Feeling good, feeling fresh
Feeling fly, I'm so alive
Is it real, is it fake
Do I care or do I mind
Got my drink, got my glass
In my hand, it is the time
I ain't got no thoughts to borrow
You better ask me tomorrow

Feeling good, feeling fresh
Feeling fly, I'm so alive
Is it real, is it fake
Do I care or do I mind
Got my drink, got my glass
In my hand, it is the time
I ain't got no thoughts to borrow
You better ask me tomorrow
