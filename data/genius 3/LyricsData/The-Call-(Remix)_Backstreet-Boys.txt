[Intro: Pharrell]
Let's party

[Verse: Pusha T]
Imagine the Backstreet Boys
Here with the Neptunes
Call it the rec room
Play time now holla
Pusha be one if you follow
Slo' mow, low-low
Thousand spoke on the gold Impala
Crushin, love my women in couples
One on each arm, keep double the trouble
So I gotta, shiffle my shuffle
Love how I cruised my hustle
Sex play, next day, call me

[AJ]
Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said "Hi, I got a little place nearby, want to go?"
I should've said no, someone's waiting for me
But I called my girl up and said

[Hook: BSB]
Listen baby I'm sorry, just wanna tell you don't worry
I will be late, don't stay up and wait for me
I'll say again you're dropping out my battery is low
So you know we're goin to a place nearby, gotta go

[Nick]
Now two years gone, nothing's been won
I can't take it back, what's done is done
One of her friends found out that she wasn't my only one
And it eats me from inside that she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied

[Hook: BSB]

[Pharrell]: Dance!
[BSB]: Hallo? Listen baby I'm sorry
(x3)

[Malice]
Don't stay up and wait
Cause I'mma be somewhere late
I feel for ya if you can relate
I take it aways, like two day stays
But look, still hit me on my two way page
See I'm heavy in the streets like a cream
Cold outside will take trips to Mary
AJ, Brian, Kevin, Nick and Howie
Accompanied by Clipse; Pusha T and Malice

[Nick]
Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery
Was about to go home when there she was standing there in front of me
And said "Hi, I got a little place nearby."

[AJ]
GOTTA GO

[Hook: BSB x2]

[BSB]
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby, gotta go
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby, gotta go

[Neptunes]
Let's party
We're going to a place nearby
We're going to a place nearby
I gotta go girl
