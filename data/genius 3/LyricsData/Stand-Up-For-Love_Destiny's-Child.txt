[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
There are times I find it hard to sleep at night
We are living through such trouble times
And every child that reaches out for someone to hold
For one moment they become my own

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
And how can I pretend that I don't know what's going on?
When every second and every minute
Another soul is gone

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
And I believe that in my life I will see
An end to hopelessness, or giving up, or suffering
If we all stand together this one time
Then no one will get left behind
Stand up for life
Stand up and hear me sing
Stand up for love

[Verse 2: Kelly]
I'm inspired and hopeful each and everyday
That's how I know that things are going to change

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly]

[Chorus: Kelly]

[Bridge: Michelle]
And it all starts right here
And it starts right now
One person stand up, and
And the rest will follow
For all the forgotten, for all the unloved
I'm gonna sing this song

[Chorus: Michelle, Beyoncé and Kelly]
