Relights of silence
Still you're calliding with me me....
And now ne can't hide it
Been to much fighting
Now we bleed....
And we've been
Both holding on
Changing the weather
Trought the storms
Staying strong
Oh Oh Oh !!!
Even trought we belong
We can't be together
When it's time to let go
It's all for the better...
It's all for the better...
Mmmh!
We'll fighting our sorrow
There'll be a tomorrow one day...
We'll find a way and
It's sometimes at the hallow
But we can't go to zero anymore...
I'm sure oh! Eeeyy!
And we've been
Both holding on
Changing the weather
Trought the storms
Staying strong
Oh Oh Oh !!!
Even trought we belong
We can't be together
When it's time to let go
It's all for the better...
It's all for the better...
It's all for the better...
It's all for the better...
Maybe someday
We'll find out how
Why we would falling apart...
Mmmh
But for now we should feel
We should trusting our hearts hearts!!1
It's all for the better...
It's all for the better...
It's all for the better...
It's all for the better...
