[Verse 1]
You don’t need a lot of money
Well, you don’t have to play no games
All I need is all your lovin’
To get the blood rushin’ through my veins

[Verse 2]
I wanna say we’re goin’ steady
Like it’s 1954
Doesn’t have to be forever
Just as long as I’m the name, on your tattooed heart

[Chorus]
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart

[Verse 3]
No, you don’t have to worry about, makin’ me crazy
'Cause I’m way past that, baby
Call me, if you want me, 'cause you got me
And I’ll show you, how much I wanna be, on your tattooed heart

[Chorus]
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Just as long as I'm the name, on your tattooed heart

[Bridge]
Wrap me in your jacket, baby
Oh, lay me in your bed
Oh, kiss me underneath the moonlight
Darlin', let me trace the lines, on your tattooed heart

[Chorus]
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart
Tattooed heart, tattooed heart

[Outro]
All that I wanna be, is the name, on your tattooed... heart
