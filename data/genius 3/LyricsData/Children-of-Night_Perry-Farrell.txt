Wake up!
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped?
Once I had, a little game
I liked to crawl back into my brain
I think you know the game I mean
I mean the game called 'go insane'

Now you should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world forget the people
And we'll erect a different steeple

Children of Night
Who among you will run with the hunt? (X2)

The snake was pale gold
Glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisons
And she was beside me
Old, she's not, young
Her dark red hair
Her white soft skin


Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look! She's coming in here
I can't live thru each slow century of her moving
Wake up! I let my cheek slide down
The cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain . . 

Children of Night
Who among you will run with the hunt? (X2)

Once I had, a little game
I liked to crawl back into my brain
I think you know the game I mean
I mean the game called 'go insane'
Now you should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world forget the people
And we'll erect a different steeple

This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes no way to lose
And I'm right there I'm going too
Release control we're breaking thru

Children of Night
Who among you will run with the hunt? (X2)

And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know (X3)
