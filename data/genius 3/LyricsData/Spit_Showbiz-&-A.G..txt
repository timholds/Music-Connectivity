You know we got it sewn for now cos I throws it down
Plus I'm frozen down with a golden sound
Where that lye at?
I blow blunts backwards nigga try that
Expose these hi-hats to my raps
When my gat blow it's more than just about rap
Strong hand the Giant and his fam, I doubt that
Gon' make cats flip with or without rap
But still make hits and shit where your mouth at?
How's that?
Bounce the track with a rap I doubt you pack
I'm straight up motherfuckers y'all cats is out the back
I must confess I smoke bless
Blessed to make the loot, investing my troops
And hold the rest, known for chess
In the rest, home alone with some dame
Name the weed Sharon cause I'm stoned
I rock the five the dire, next stop is the money train
See me in the Range then you know that the money came

Wanna be blown retarded, I got a Jones for dollars
And if you know what I know you'll say hoes hit the hardest
Roll with known robbers but still burn scholars
With PhDs, my degrees is 360
Merc'ed off in the zero that follows the fifty
I believe I can fly even higher than these trees get me
I brought the Desert E's with me
With more clips than a bag of roaches
I'm mad explosive
Keep watching, y'all foul like judges in boxing
Out fox 'em you better hold your head it's not an option
Excel on the spot you're shell shocked I shall rock
At first it was catch and kiss now hoes catch a dick
Like 62 grams I flip quick a brick couldn't slow me down
Cause only I hold me down
Now these hoes change faces they wanna stroke me now
Cause they know it's me but next move it's G.H.E.T.T.O.U.T

A-yo in God's name I grab mics and create flames
And blaze shit leave 'em in amazement with basics
Face it, I'm the dopest in here
Checking for the second baddest bitch
Cause the first is who I came with
I peeped 'em fiending, to Roc Raida, play it again
We got 'em leaning, like some D that's rated a ten
You sport the ice and rock the Rolie
I done that
But here's a jewel a nigga once told me
Run that!
It's real feeling steel on your back
Listen closely now I tote gats for shit like that
On the rise to the top, they wanna take what we got
But Allah is the master planner so let's plot
Nigga front like my shit ain't hot, I go bananas
Similar to Scanners on some unidentified shit
So peep the livest, don't sleep cause I don't like surprises
The Bronx got more stripes than tigers
