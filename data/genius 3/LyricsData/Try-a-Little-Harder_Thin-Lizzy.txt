I'm gonna make a little money gonna give it to the Holy Ghost
And tell all the people about the world I miss the most

And try a little harder
Just to see what it could do
Try a little harder
So don't be sad Baby Blue

When I'd find myself in trouble he'd be the one I'd bring them to
It means an awful lot to me it might not mean that much to you

And I'd try a little harder
Just to see what it could do
Try a little harder
So don't be sad Baby Blue

No matter where I travel, no matter where I try to go
His memory is in my thoughts you know it always lingers so

And I'll try a little harder
Just to see what it could do (Come on)
Try a little harder
Don't be sad Baby Blue

Try a little harder
Just to see what it could do

Try a little harder baby
Don't be sad Baby Blue (Come on)

Try a little harder baby
Don't be sad Baby Blue

Try a little harder baby
Stop your crying Baby Blue

I'm gonna make a little money gonna give it to the Holy Ghost
And tell all the people about the world I miss the most

And I'll try a little harder
Just to see what it could do
Try a little harder baby
Don't be sad Baby Blue

Try a little harder baby
Don't be sad Baby Blue
Tr...y a little harder

Try a little harder baby
Don't be sad Baby Blue
Try a little harder baby
Don't be sad Baby Blue
Oooh...
