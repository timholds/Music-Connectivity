Disconnected
Turned off inside
Disconnected for a while
Stars are coming out tonight
A billion moments marked in time

My frustrations
They made me blind
In relation to the line
Where past and present still collide
A billion moments marked in time

A winding road
Take it this far
Into the great unknown
Take it this far
The afterglow
Take it this far
Of the lava flow
Take it this far

(Ever believe in anything?)

A winding road
Take it this far
Into the great unknown
Take it this far
To bend and grow
Take it this far
To let it go
Take it this far

Take it
Take it
