Na Na Na na na-na na nah
Na na nana na nah
I'll lay it down one time

I'll lay it down one time, gather 'round
Though this is a chore
So rich with lies I prefer poor advice
And showed her the door

This is your goodbye and kiss opportunity
Thought you were burning me down
But I'm finally free yeah

If you miss me - don't
If I never want to see you again - I won't
If you get an invitation I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'll mend this situation

Oh the sun came up
Tell me where'd I park
We did it again
We had some fun did some things we got dumb
But I want it to end

Cos I only give in when I get the need
I'm only coming around cos I get to leave

If you miss me - don't
If I never want to see you again - I won't
If you get an invitation I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'll mend this situation

Can't breathe, I can't sleep
Thinking 'bout the best of you and
Some things I couldn't see
What about the rest of you?
Well, you're under my skin
But I can't let you win
Though you don't see scars
That's exactly what they are baby

Na na nana na nah
Na na nana na nah
Ooooh oh (Na na nana na nah)
Baby, baby, baby
You're never gonna hurt me

If you miss me don't
If I never wanna see you again
I won't
If you get an invitation
I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'm in this situation
If you miss me don't
If I never wanna see you again
I won't
If you get an invitation
I'm probably drunk
You're just as hot as radiation
But I'm in this situation

Na na nana na nah
Yes I am
Na na nana na nah
I gotta get out
Na na nana na nah
Na na nana na nah
If you miss me (Na na nana na nah)
If you miss me, if you miss me (ooooh oh)
Na na nana na nah (Baby baby)
Na na nana na nah.. (tell if you miss me)
