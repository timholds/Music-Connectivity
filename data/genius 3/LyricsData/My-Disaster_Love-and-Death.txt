[Verse 1]
How can you watch me suffer
How does it feel
Why do you stay so silent
Will the time reveal

[Pre-Hook]
You’re the leader I follow
Am I a victim of circumstance

[Hook]
Feeling everything
Crashing down on me
Lost and so afraid
It’s my Disaster
Losing everything
Giving all of me
I feel so betrayed
In my Disaster

[Verse 2]
How can you say you love me?
It’s so unclear
I hope the pain will leave one day
With all the fear

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
But I’ll make it through
But I’ll make it through

I’ve got to dominate
I will not tolerate it
Will I appreciate
The pain that leads me to you

[Hook]

[Outro]
But I’ll make it through
My Disaster
But I’ll make it through
My Disaster
