[Intro]
How I've waited for you to come
I've been here all along
Now that you've arrived
Please stay alive
And I promise I won't keep you long
I'll keep you forever...forever...forever...

[Verse 1]
Graze the skin with my fingertips
The brush of dead cold flesh appease the means
Provoking images delicate features so smooth
A pleasant fragrance in the light of the moon

[Chorus]
Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptation's lost all control

[Verse 2]
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control, rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants!

In the depths of a mind insane
Fantasy and reality are the same!

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
Graze the skin with my fingertips
The brush of dead warm flesh pacifies the means
Incised members ornaments on my being
Adulating the skin before me

[Verse 2]
Simple smiles elude psychotic eyes
Lose all mind control, rationale declines
Empty eyes enslave the creations
Of placid faces and lifeless pageants!

[Chorus]
Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptation's lost all control
Dance with the dead in my dreams
Listen to their hallowed screams
The dead have taken my soul
Temptation's lost all control
