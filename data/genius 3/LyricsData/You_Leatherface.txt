They go walking in the rain
They go dancing every single day
Another blackboard drawing is wiped away
And they like you and I like you
They like the words hey they like the songs
The songs that should be for everyone
They like the words
Hey and they like you and they like you
And they go waltzing in the rain
They're artexing every single day
They watch long shore drifting sand away
They like the words and they they like the songs
The songs that should be for everyone
They like the words
Hey and they like you and I like you
A paper plane flies flies away
A toy train passes by again and again
I feel lashing rain and I like I like you
They like the words they they like the songs
The songs that should be for everyone
They like the words
They and they like you and they like you
They like you they like you they like you
And they like you and they like you
