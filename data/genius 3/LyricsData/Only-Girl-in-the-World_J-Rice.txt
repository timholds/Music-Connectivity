I want you to love me, like I'm a hot ride
Keep thinking of me, doing what you like
So girl forget about the world cause it's going be me and you tonight
I wanna make you beg for it, then I'm make you swallow your pride

Want I to make you feel like You're the only girl in the world
Like You're the only one that I'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world...
Like you're the only one that's in command
Cause you're the only one who understands how to make my feel like a man
Want I to make You feel like You're
The only girl in the world
Like You're
The only one that Ill ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one...

Want you to take me like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow, make me feel right
Baby I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin', you can come inside
And when you enter, you ain't leaving, be my prisoner for the night

Want I to make you feel like You're the only girl in the world
Like You're the only one that I'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world...
Like you're the only one that's in command
Cause you're the only one who understands how to make my feel like a man
Want I to make You feel like You're
The only girl in the world
Like you're
The only one that Ill ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only one...

Take me for a ride
Oh baby, take me high
Let me make you first
Oh make it last all night
Take me for a ride
Oh baby, take me high
Let me make you first
Make it last all night

Want I to make you feel like You're the only girl in the world
Like You're the only one that I'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl
