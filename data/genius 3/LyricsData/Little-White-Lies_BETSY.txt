[Verse 1]
It’s the little white lies playing on my mind
And it's hanging right over me
'Cause my heart is lost, myself I don’t trust
'Cause it's crumbling down on me

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t know where this goes
You should hear truth untold, you’re so innocent
Tired feet on the ground
I can’t feel what you've found
It's not making sense to me

[Chorus]
Oh the little white lies, no they don’t feel right
But I just can’t give what you need
Oh the little white lies, no I just can't hide
Oh the little white lies are following me

[Verse 2]
No I don't disguise what I feel inside
And I never aim to mislead
I’ve had a thousand strikes and I’m still not out
Cause you’re just too kind to see

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t know where this goes
You should hear truth untold, you’re so innocent
Tired feet on the ground
I can’t feel what you've found
It's not making sense to me

[Chorus]
Oh the little white lies, no they don’t feel right
But I just can’t give what you need
Oh the little white lies, no I just can't hide
Oh the little white lies are following me

[Bridge]
Don’t throw your love away on me
Don’t waste your time away on me
I’m the dark to your bright
Can’t hold back the storm
From a sinner to a saint
Is that what you’re waiting for?
It's my drink, it's my drug
Always needed more
I can’t run, I can’t run, I can’t run
I can’t run, I can’t run, I can’t run

[Chorus]
Oh the little white lies, no they don’t feel right
But I just can’t give what you need
Oh the little white lies, no I just can't hide
'Cause these little white lies follow me
Oh the little white lies, no they don’t feel right
But I just can’t give what you need
Oh the little white lies, no I just can't hide
From these little white lies
Oh these little white lies are following me
