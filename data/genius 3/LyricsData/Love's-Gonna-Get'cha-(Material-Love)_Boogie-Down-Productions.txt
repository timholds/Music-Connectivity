[Verse 1, KRS-One]
Im in junior high with a b plus grade
At the end of the day I don't hit the arcade
I walk from school to my moms apartment
I got to tell the suckas everyday "don't start it"
Cause where I'm at if you're soft you're lost
To say on course means to roll with force
A boy named Rob is chillin in a Benz
In front of my building with the rest of his friends
I give him a pound, oh I mean I shake his hand
He's the neighborhood drug dealer, my man
I go upstair and hug my mother
Kiss my sister, and punch my brother
I sit down on my bed to watch some tv
(machine gun fire) do my ears decieve me
Nope, thats the fourth time this week
Another fast brother shot dead in the street
The very next day while im off to class
My moms goes to work cold busting her ass
My sisters cute but she got no gear
I got three pairs of pants and with my brother I share
See there in school see I'm made a fool
With one and a half pair of pant you ain't cool
But there's no dollars for nothing else
I got beans, rice, and bread on my shelf
Every day I see my mother struggling
Now its time i've got to do
Something
I look for work I get dissed like a jerk
I do odd jobs and come
Home like a slob
So here comes Rob his gold and chivalry
He gives me two hundred for a quick delivery
I do it once, I do it twice
Now theres steak with the beans and rice
My mother's nervous but she knows the deal
My sister's gear now has sex appeal
My brothers my partner and we're getting paper
Three months later we run our own caper
My family's happy everything is new
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do

[Hook]
Thats why, (loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
You fall in love with your chain
You fall in love with your car
Loves gonna sneak right up and snuff you from behind
So I want you to check the story out as we go down the line
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)

[Verse 2, KRS-One]
Money's flowing, everything is fine
Got myself an uzi and my brother a nine
Business is boomin' everything is cool
I pull about a g a week fuck school
A year goes by and I begin to grow
Not in height but juice and cash flow
I pick up my feet and begin to watch tv
Cause now I got other people working for me
I got a 55 inch television you know
And every once in awhile I hear just say no
Or the other commercial I love
Is when they say, this is your brain on drugs
I pick up my remote control and just turn
Cause with that bullshit im not concerned
See me and my brother jump in the BM
Driving around our territory again
I stop at the light like a superstar
And automatic weapons cold sprayed my car
I hit the accelerater scared as
Shit
And drove one block to find my brother was hit
He wasn't dead but the blood was pouring
And all I could think about was war and
Later I found that it was Rob and his crew
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do

[Hook]
Thats why, (loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
You fall in love with your chain
You fall in love with your car
Loves gonna sneak right up and snuff you from behind
So I want you to check the story out as we go down the line
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)

[Verse 3, KRS-One]
My brothers out of it, but I'm still in it
On top of that im in it to win it
I can't believe that Rob would diss me
That faggot, that punk, he's soft a sissy
I'm driving around now with three of my guys
The war is on and I'm on the rise
We rolled right up to his favorite hang out
Said hello and then the bullets rang out
Some fired back so we took cover
And all I could think about was my brother
Rob jumped up and began to run
Busting shots hoping to hit someone
So I just stopped, and let off three shots
Two hit him and one hit a cop
I threw the gun down and began to shout
Come on I got him it's time to break out
But as we ran there were the boys in blue
Pointing their guns at my four man crew
They shot down one, they shot down
Two
Now tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do

[Hook]
Thats why, (loves gonna get you)
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
You fall in love with your chain
You fall in love with your car
Loves gonna sneak right up and snuff you from behind
So I want you to check the story out as we go down the line
(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)(loves gonna get you)
