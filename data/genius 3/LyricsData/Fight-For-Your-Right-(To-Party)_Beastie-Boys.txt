[Intro]
{Now boys, don't get into any trouble while Mommy and Daddy are gone, and DON'T make a mess!

Do you like parties?
Yeah
We can invite all our friends and have soda and pie
Yeah!
I hope no bad people show up…

Kick it!

[Verse 1]
You wake up late for school, man, you don't wanna go
You ask your mom please, but she still says no
You missed two classes and no homework
But your teacher preaches class like you're some kind of jerk

[Refrain]
You gotta fight for your right to party

[Verse 2]
Your pop caught you smoking, and he said: "No way!"
That hypocrite smokes two packs a day
Man, living at home is such a drag
Now your mom threw away your best porno mag (Busted!)

[Refrain]
You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight

[Verse 3]
Don't step out of this house if that's the clothes you're gonna wear
I'll kick you out of my home if you don't cut that hair
Your mom busted in and said, “What's that noise?"
Aw, Mom, you're just jealous it's the Beastie Boys

[Refrain]
You gotta fight for your right to party
You gotta fight for your right to party

[Outro]
Parrrrrrty
Parrrrrrty
Yeah!
