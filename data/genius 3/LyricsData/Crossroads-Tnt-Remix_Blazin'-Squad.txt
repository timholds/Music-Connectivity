So tell me what u gonna do?
'what u gonna do when there ain't no where 2 run'
Wen judgement comes 2 u, wen judgment comes 2 u
So tell me wat u gonna do?
'wat u gonna do wen there ain't no place 2 hide'
Wen judgment comes 2, cos its gonna come

See, you at the crossroads, decisions that u gotta make
On top of the day decisions that u call fate
It this wat u hate? wen love comes 2 it
Wen the time comes can u pull up the courage 2 do it?
Its just mistakes in the worst form of it
U didn't no we were goin 4 it
And now were comin all day, all night
Were ready to give an explanation on the mic so u can survive

So wat you gonna do, when people hate u?
'i might run i might hide'
But there gonna find u
What? 'its my own choice or path'
But if u make the wrong decision face the aftermath
Will u eva learn? livin a lie u'll get burned
'i'm quick to make a u turn, make decisions, change directions'
U gotta take resposibilty for ur actions

Oh oh oh an we pray, an we pray
Eh eh eh, everyday, everyday
Oh oh oh an we pray, an we pray
Eh eh eh everyday, still we lay

See u at the crossroads
So u won't be lonley
See u at the crossroads
So u won't be lonley
See u at the crossroads
So u won't be lonley

Its the hip hop, flip the top spot
Pick pockets, blood, pain
Wens it gonna stop?
Why can't we just live together?
You know that all we gotta do is stick together
N we can roll, all night long
Rest in peace, write a little song
Coz, nobody wants pain no more
So were ripin up the set n were causin an uproar

U live ur life like a gangsta, 2 ur own
Pushed ya to ya role in life n now its bin sold
Ur the weakest link in ur own mind
Bet u wish u cud turn back the hands of time
But u can't

Haveta keep it on the D-low
Life ain't even n u no it ain't even so so
My attacks on these tunes like a nuclear blow
'so u better make the right decision at the crossroads. yo'

Oh oh oh an we pray, an we pray
Eh eh eh everyday, everyday
Oh oh oh an we pray, an we pray
Eh eh eh everyday, still we lay

See u at the crossroads
So u won't be lonley
See u at the crossroads
So u won't be lonley
See u at the crossroads
So u won't be lonley

So im talkin to everybody, so im talkin to everybody
Whos willin to make a change
So im talkin to everybody, so im talkin to everybody
Who went the wrong way
So im talkin to everybody, so im talkin to everybody
Whos willin to make a change
So im talkin to everybody, so im talkin to everybody
Who went the wrong way
