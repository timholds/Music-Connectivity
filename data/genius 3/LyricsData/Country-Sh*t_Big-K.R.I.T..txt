Let me tell you 'bout this
Super fly, dirty, dirty
Third coast muddy water
Shawty, pop that pussy if ya wanna

Let me tell you 'bout this
Old school, pourin' lean
Candy yams and collard greens
Pocket fulla stone, ridin' clean

Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country, country shit (Country, country shit)
Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country, country shit (Country, country shit)

Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country country shit (Country, country shit)
Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country country shit, yeah, country shit

I told 'em, aw man, hold up
What you know about it?
Candy cars, superstars
Rubber bands in my pocket

A couple broads for the poppin'
If she ridin' then she boppin'
Bitch, I'm sellin' if you shoppin'
If you need it then I got it

If I want it then I cop it
If you don't like, nigga, top it
Why you worried 'bout mine, hoe?
What's off in your wallet?

I was ridin' my screw shit
Rims chop choppin'
Top dropping throwin' bread crumbs
Crows start flockin'

Knockin' pictures off the wall
We sit tall, we still crawl
We still shoot, we still score
We still win so we still ball

We still hood so fuck the law
I got nuts and I got loot
If you can't see the king
In a nigga like me undoubtedly
Well, fuck him too

Let me tell you 'bout this
Super fly, dirty, dirty
Third coast muddy water
Shawty, pop that pussy if ya wanna

Let me tell you 'bout this
Old school, pourin' lean
Candy yams and collard greens
Pocket fulla stone, ridin' clean

Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country, country shit (Country, country shit)
Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country, country shit (Country, country shit)

Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country country shit (Country, country shit)
Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country country shit, country country shit

Okay, the caddy still swangin'
And the trunk still bangin'
Nigga trickin' ain't pimpin', shawty
What is y'all thinkin'?

What, what, what is y'all sayin'?
What, what, what is y'all sangin'?
Hit the club by the bar
Like what is y'all drankin'?

Old school, foreign cars, shawty
What is y'all crankin'?
Kush blunts, bank tellers ask me
Why is y'all stankin'?

If it's money I chill, shawty
Why is y'all playin'?
She was bound to fuck a pimp
So why is you carin'?

Save the hoe
Cape crusader and her service aidin' hoe
Dame the hoe, blame the hoe
For the same shit you pay me fo'

Shake it mo' for a pimp
With my shrimp on my plate
Countryfied, country fly with a tape

Let me tell you 'bout this
Super fly, dirty, dirty
Third coast muddy water
Shawty, pop that pussy if ya wanna

Let me tell you 'bout this
Old school, pourin' lean
Candy yams and collard greens
Pocket fulla stone, ridin' clean

Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country, country shit (Country, country shit)
Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country, country shit (Country, country shit)

Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country country shit (Country, country shit)
Let me tell you 'bout this country shit
Country country shit, country country shit
