[Verse 1: Snoop Dogg]
Snoopy
Is what they say as if they knew me
Groupies, on my head like a cufi
My nigga Kid Cudi
That's my little buddy
Call some ho's up and get some cutty cutty
What yo life like?
Mine's is kinda tight
A long way from hustlin'
That china white
My people love, the fans love me I'm all go
If you ain't showin' love, then what did you call fo'?
I don't need it in my life, my kids pay the price
So alike and in need of my wife, smoke till I'm gone
Dog on the throne
I'm world-wide known I'm a boss in the zone
I get it how I get it cause I can, I earn my spot
You see the plans, I'm just fuckin' with my fans
I turned out to be the better man, important to life
You understand while I'm puffin' on this gram

[Hook: Kid Cudi]
Everything I'm havin', no there ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grindin'
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them ho's, don't love them ho's
The code in which y'all roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam and I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah
I can't forget that tree
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
I get my fam dawg, look at my niggas
Got a little money y'all, and I ain't trippin'
Most days I'm faded, feeling ex-rated
Steady wantin' freaky hoes, then I want a lady
Holdin' the fam down and my close homie
The peoples who were there, when some sucka left me lonely
Phony, when you see a nigga don't approach me
Made it to the top baby, that's on me
Koch trying to claim that they made me
However you feel, another real fugazzi
I keep it one hundred, never frontin', don't need be
I'm in another zone, no place for pussy, my nigga
Conyo to haters that don't know, low pro, how a nigga like from costo
The one fans loved, who was always approachable, yo
And I rep the double O, smokin', eatin' Cheerios

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Can't forget it, they made me who I am, a king
And I'm still on the scene you gotta love it
All out in public
The people want to touch it
I need a blunt with the stuffin'
Nigga, it's nothin' for me to chill out, post up at the house
With Madden on the screen and smash on the homies
Hollywood nice now
Everyone on me and on the blogs talk shit like they know me
Aww fool, take you niggas to school
"How to get rich and stay cool"
Snoopy D O Dub show you homie
Even with the critics and Feds all on me
I was tappin' all the chonies
Dog, but my folks call me Snoopy
Boss dogg nigga sue me
Pony tail swangin' as I lay in the jacuzzi
Love of my life while I'm puffin' on the oww wee, kush

[Hook]

[Outro: Snoop Dogg]
Snoop Dogg in the house tonight blowing that Laker purp that I know you like, right?
Kid Cudi, my nephew, blaze that shit right now would you? Would you? Right?
Snoop Dogg in the house tonight blowing that Laker purp that I know you like, right?
Kid Cudi, my nephew, blaze that shit right now my nigga, right?
