I tried to warn you, baby
I tried to tell you I was down
Oh yeah, yeah
You would not listen, baby
You would not help me when I was down
Oh no, no

He tells her, does anybody understand I love her?
That girl she holds my heart in her hands
Oh baby, oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't
Baby, please don't go
Oh no, no, no, no, no
Baby, please don't
Baby, please don't go

I tried to warn you, baby
I tried to tell you, don't let me down
Oh no, no
You would not listen, baby
Baby, you would not leave me go down
Oh no, no

He tells her there is foolish, there is wise, he loves her
The young ones hold their heart up to the skies
And dance the night away

Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't
Baby, please don't go
Oh no, no, no, no, no
Baby, please don't
Baby, please don't go

There is foolish, there is wise
There is anger in his tone
There is truth behind the lies
His heart has turned to stone

Wherever you may be
He loves her
Wherever you may stand, he tells her
He loves her in this land

Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't
Baby, please don't go
Oh no, no, no, no, no
Baby, please don't
Baby, please don't go

Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't
Baby, please don't go
Oh no, no, no, no, no
Baby, please don't
Baby, please don't go
Oh no, oh no
(repeat)

Baby, please don't go
Don't hurt me so
Don't leave me now
Don't leave me this way
Baby, please don't go
