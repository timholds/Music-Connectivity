[Intro]
A tale of two cities. Right here

[Verse 1: Nature]
It's time we set it straight, connect with Dre the correct way
Predicting platinum in less then a day
So for that we toast amongst us while y'all lackin' hope
All I do is write raps, stack, relax and smoke
Seeing my dreams come true stayin' humble in the eyes of others
Politicin with the wisest brothers
It's Nature one of the greatest peep how I play this
Straight from the Bridge one of your kids favorites
From now 'till the day that I'm stiff, fowl flagerant pay the rent
Always stay swift, stuck in my ways type shovanistic
Since a youth I had a thing for big jewels
Flooded rings and older bitches, holding my riches
In lump sums for trust funds fully recoved thugs lust to bust guns
While niggas get drunk beat wifes and cuss sons
A slow process called life, let's show progress

[Verse 2: Dr. Dre]
Don Cortes, white rags cherry Bentley
Cop shines from Italy speak money language fluently
Never fuck with the nastiest flashiest
Bought a house as big as Scarface to show my happiness
Rackin' the 6 0's for those that want to get personal to home
Cock the heavy metal rollin' with my stones
Prominent with flashy garments, spread a mill small bills
Bring a smile to an ice grill
Popular, loved throughout the industry
If they sue light a philly cause the judge has gotta Free Willy
Salute with chill Remy gently escort four ladies an arm
The four caesars at the club Pentleys condo sweets I'm fancy
20 floors up overlookin' ladies boomerang they panties
Bump the Firm Family's latest takin' trips to Las Dregas
That's how we do it Aftermath incorporated

[Hook]
C'mon c'mon c'mon c'mon it's the motherfuckin' Firm Family ooh
Yeah, I better pinch myself to make sure I'm not dreaming
Ooh cause the way you make me feel I feel like ooh screaming

[Verse 3: Nature]
I spit rhymes for the radio and spit for tours
Spend doe that I never thought I'd hold before
Now if you just wanna front, you know my styles tight
Niggas never should of plugged up the motherfuckin' mic
Sippin' Tanqueray 60 inch screen when we hang with Dre
I just flew in from Queens no bag and plan to stay
In the heat park this Royals Royce up in the beat
Seeing topless bitches rollerblading in the street

[Verse 4: Dr. Dre]
While I lounge in a jacuzzi sky cliff blue got the whole crew
Nas, AZ, Nature, Foxy there too, how we do?
Hit trees Cristal bottles, breeze tropical spread love till we wobble
It's time to give let the kids live comfortable
Anybody pumpin' beef between the East and West: fuck you
Make moves political hit this revenue
Set examples respect every individual

[Hook]
