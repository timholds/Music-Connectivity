I never knew I'd find a love so true
This one right here, is just for you

Remember that One day
I held your hands then I kissed your lips then I told you
Our love was meant to be and always will forever
Give me that happiness I get from you just being there

I always see you when I close my eyes, you're on my mind
So can't you see, I need you right here wit me, close by my side
This time for sure, Gonna let you know, My love is straight from the heart

Forever you're my girl Forever be my world
You are the only one
The only one I'll ever need, my life is you and me
Forever you're my girl Forever be my world
You are the only one
I'll never break your heart "no", so baby don't let go

Even through the hard times
We made it through just fine
When it hurt we put in the work
To show that I'm yours
And that your mine
That's how we got this far
Let's never be apart
Girl, you're my queen
I'm here for you
'Cuz you're my everything

You always make me feel like everything's gonna be alright
Wit the things you do, becuz it's you the real true love of my life
This time for sure, Gonna let you know, My love is straight from the heart

Forever you my girl Forever be my world
You are the only one
The only one I'll ever need, my life is you & me
Forever you my girl Forever be my world
You are the only one
I'll never break your heart "no", so baby don't let go

Uh... Baby!
You know I'd walk them miles
Climb mountains switch up styles
All I wanna do, is be with you
Ain't no matter what, where and how
[Right here and now] we can both get down [straight work it out] yeah
Like that sound bump 'n grindin' perfect timin'
Let's dine and both be proud yeah yeah yeah

Gonna take you on a joyride today
Me and you stay true never hesitate
To make love — sure enough
You're the only one I'm ever thinkin' of
Just to hold you baby I can hardly wait
As we go through the motions damn it's great
To make love — sure enough
We're gonna take it to the end and that's what's up

You are the only one I want to spend my whole life with I know
Anywhere you are, that's where I will call home
So just take my hand and say that you will never let it go
Two hearts always beating as one forever more

Forever you my girl Forever be my world
You are the only one
The only one I'll ever need, my life is you & me
Forever you my girl Forever be my world
You are the only one
I'll never break your heart "no", so baby don't let go

I'm nothing without you I'm nothing without you girl
I'm nothing without you I'm nothing without you girl
