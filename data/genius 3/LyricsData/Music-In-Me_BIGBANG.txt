There was music in me and you know it
If you'd let go you might love it
Better if we dare to show it
This is true

Long time ago in an airplane
Flying into night time LA
Stronger than man with their muscles
Stronger than magic shampoo

And it will stay
Emotion is all sail away
I can't help but cry out and say
Come on now my girl sail away with me

The first time I sat in the airplane
Flying into night time LA
Thinking of dreamers and dreams yet to come
Thinking of you
I knew you had someone else baby
And I should forget about love
No one can touch my heart though baby
Like you

And it will stay
Emotion is all sail away
I can't help but cry out and say
Come on now my girl sail away with me
