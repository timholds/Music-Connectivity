[Verse 1]
Baby take my car keys, put em in your pocket
Lord knows I got no business with them
I been nursing half a beer for half and hour
But the whole rooms spinning
My brain is acting fuzzy
But the vertigo I'm feeling
Got nothing to do with inebriation
That kiss you just handed me
Girl, is a staggering revelation

[Chorus]
Baby I never drank that much
To get this high I must be drunk on love
Baby I'm flying on a stone cold rush
To get this high I must be drunk on love

[Verse 2]
I been down on my knees
Before the porcelain throne
Suffered the wrath of the god of Tequila
After dancing on a bar doing my very best
Cowboy ballerina - you ought to see it

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I built a pyramid of beer cans
On a bar top in Austin
Laid to rest in them
Like some ancient Egyption
I can see well enough to know
You're my favourite kind of intervention

[Chorus]
