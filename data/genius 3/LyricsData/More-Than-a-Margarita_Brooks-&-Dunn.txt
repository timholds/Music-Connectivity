[Verse 1]
I started my day with Corona
Hoping it'd help me get over
The night that you left
But it didn't help
So I moved on to tequila
Built a pyramid up to the ceiling
Ten glasses high
But I can still hear you saying goodbye

[Chorus]
It's going to take more than a margarita
More than a shooter
To blow your memory away
I still need you
I'm hurting without you
Even when I'm feeling no pain

[Verse 2]
Well, tonight I'm the life of the party
Joking about my broken heart
But it's easy to see
The joke's on me
That waitress just asked how I want it
With or without the salt on it
I shook my head
Either way ain't going to make me forget

[Chorus][x4]
