[Chorus]
Baby, what can I do
To make it right for you?
Baby, what can I do, what can I do
To make it right for you?

[Verse 1]
I was doing all I could
To numb it out
It's taken all I've got
To not just break down

[Verse 2]
But I want to surrender
I want the tears to come
The sooner they start
The sooner I'll be done

[Verse 3]
What the hell did they do to you
To make you so scared of falling in love
And feeling you care?

[Verse 4]
I pray, one day out there
You will find a love
That crowns you
And all the fears will come undone

[Chorus]
Oh baby, baby
What can I do
To make it right for you?

Oh baby, baby
What can I do
To make it right for you
Right for you, right for you?

Oh baby, baby
What can I do?
Baby, baby, baby
To make it right for you?
