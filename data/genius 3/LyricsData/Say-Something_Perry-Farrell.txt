I like to dance in crowds
I like to make love out loud
I always keep a fire burning
And friends help fill things out

When you're someone
Who meets someone?

Like the shade
Meets the shadow
Like a man meets his match

And in this crowded room
There's only one I see
One who makes my fire burn
Her eyes reach out to me

When you're someone
Who meets someone?

Like the clouds
Meet the mountains
And they sing out snowy notes

Cherubs turn away their blushing faces
Leaving us aroused and bare
In your garden, everything is there

When you're someone
Who meets someone?

Oh, you've got to say something
Sing out snowy notes!

Cherubs turn away their blushing faces
Leaving us aroused and bare
