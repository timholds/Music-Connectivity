[Verse]
And now it's up to me
Making sure I'm not in too deep
Keep first and on my feet
My sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine
My sunshine

[Chorus]
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine
My sunshine

[Post-Chorus]

[Verse]
And now it's up to me
Making sure I'm not in too deep
Keep first and on my feet
My sunshine

[Pre-Chorus]
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine
My sunshine

[Chorus]
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine
My sunshine
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine ([?] you can't steal my sunshine)
My sunshine
