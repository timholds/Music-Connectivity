[Verse 1]
You can buy you a brand new truck
Chrome it all out, jack it way up
You can build you a house up high on a hill
With a pool and a pond and a view to kill
You can make all the money in sight
But you ain't living the good life

[Chorus]
Until you put a girl in it
You ain't got nothin
What's it all worth
Without a little loving
Put a girl in it
Some huggin and some kissin
If you're world's got somethin missin
Just put a girl in it

[Verse 2]
You can buy a boat and a shiny set of skis
Have some fun in the sun, float around in the breeze
You can lay out on a blanket by the lake
Drink a cold beer, polish off another day
Kick on back and watch the sky turn red
A sunset ain't a sunset

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You can write you a country song
The DJ won't put it on
They won't dance or sing along

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If you're ridin in your truck
Put a girl in it
If you're going to have a party
Put a girl in it
If you want to live the good life
Better put a gir-r-rl in it
