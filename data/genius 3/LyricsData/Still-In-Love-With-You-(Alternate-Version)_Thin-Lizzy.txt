Think I'll just fall to pieces
If I don't find something else to do
This sadness never ceases
I'm still in love with you

My head it keeps on reeling
It's got me in a crazy spin
But, darling, darling, darling
Is this the end?

I'm still in love with you

They say time has a way of healing
Dries all the tears from your eyes
But, darling, it's this empty feeling
My heart can't disguise

After all that we've been through
I try my best but it's no use
I guess I'll keep on loving you
Is this the end?

Now that it's all over
Woman, there's something I think you should know
Baby, baby, think it over
Just one time before you go

Call on me, baby
If there's anything I can do for you
Call on me, baby
Help me see it through

Call on me, baby
Why don't you call on me, baby
Oh help me see it through
I'm in love with you
