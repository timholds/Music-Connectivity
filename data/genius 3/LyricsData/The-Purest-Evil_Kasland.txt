[Verse 1: Kasland]
Can you tell me what you call it when a man can't stand
That feeling that you get when a damn hand lands
On a time you don't need like bam, can chance
Give me a second helping cause I can't stand fans
How is it that I can command a whole army
Of demons throughout the land when all they do is harm me
I tried to run from the devil, but I knew he saw me
So I stopped, I didn't know what to do, I'm sorry
What should I do? I think I lost my mind
Wait, wait, where was I? Oh yeah, I lost my mind
Do you turn in your sleep? Because I toss in mine
Every nightmare I have becomes an awesome rhyme
I don't inspire kids to kill so stop accusing me
I'm the one who killed the person that I used to be
He was first and you're the sequel
Ladies and gentlemen, the purest evil

[Hook: Baby Bone & Kasland]
You can say what you want I don't care I'm the truth
In my city, in the streets, or in the mother fucking booth
Yeah bitch I'm bad, of course I'm pure evil
I bet you everything that you do ain't legal
You ain't got to like it, but your girlfriend love it
Do my thing in private act an ass in public
Give you three hands and you still couldn't touch it
And you still couldn't touch it

[Verse 2: Baby Bone]
I know you think I'm bad, but it's all good
Yeah I understand, but I'm never understood
Where I'm from, it's a long way from Hollywood
But my dream's still bigger than a Redwood
That's a big tree, I smoke big tree
Get with Marty McFly, change history
Before my time, I don't even know why I'm here
I go hard any date you can pick a year
Turn the cameras off, fuck the limelight
Eat these rappers up, now that's a soundbite
Maybe not because I want to keep my appetite
And I ain't saying I'm the best, but I'm alright
Alright, nobody believes me
When I disappear you want to act like you need me
You better watch how you treat me
Being good hard being evil is easy

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Kasland]
Try not to be offended by the shit that I say
Less mess will be made now that they're kissing my A
-S-S if anything I'll be around 'til the day
Feds fess that they're obsessed and won't get off of my case
Best guess is that I'm wicked balling
Cured while the sick are falling
It's a problem, it's involving every single way
That I pissed them off and it's my fault what else is there to say
Man I missed them all and hit the wall now all I do is pray
Dear heavenly father please forgive me for my sins
Please forgive me for the items that I carry in my Benz
I know it's probably too late for me to make amends
I know my enemies lost, but in the end nobody wins
And now I have no friends and I've come to realize
The shadows that I followed, they were not the real guys
I walked into the darkness with no light and sealed eyes
So now when I'm dead on my tombstone here lies

[Hook]
