[Hook from Marianne Williamson's "Our Deepest Fear"]
It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us
We were all meant to shine, as children do
It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone
As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others

[Verse 1: Omen]
What a blessing to be inspired
Visualizing and manifesting things I've desired
The most intelligent intellectual never pseudo
My beats and my rhymes, my own dynamic duo
I have them bitter, have them shivering, have them quiver
My destiny is to be fly, just call me caterpillar
I'm visionary, I've seen things that haven't happened
The quiet assassin Aquarius has started rapping
Analyzing, deliberating, stayed up at night
Questioning why I'm afraid of the heights
Such a nice guy, Maybe I was raised too polite
Tell me how you so shy, but you blazing the mic
Unexplainable, God gave me this flame to ignite
Such a long journey here, but I stayed on the hike
Motivated by my team, told me dream, told me stop second-guessing
A blessing when your friends are your best competition

[Hook]
It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us
We were all meant to shine, as children do (liberation)
It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone (liberation)
As we are liberated from our own fear (liberation), our presence automatically liberates others

[Verse 2: Omen]
Everybody telling me I'm next
Man, my fans is the best psychics
Tell your favorite rappers better where they best diapers
Cause I'm here, I can smell your fear
Your whole career just turned into a whole puddle of tears
Heard them say I'm way too quiet to achieve my plans
If they only knew the loudest is the weakest man
Name: Omen, but D-Money be the alias
Nobody's above me, but trust, I ain't atheist
I never worry about a hater, I know I wasn't meant to fail
People really only hate you when they hate themselves
Got a lot of new friends and they fake as hell
They behind me, but they tryna form a paper trail
I just wanna feel comfortable, I want a classy woman
Where's my Clair Huxtable?
I'm feeling I could find my dream here tonight
That's not a train in the tunnel where I see the light

[Hook]
It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us
We were all meant to shine, as children do (liberation)
It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone (liberation)
As we are liberated from our own fear (liberation), our presence automatically liberates others (yeah)

[Verse 3: Omen]
You can't imagine what I've seen in my life
Through the madness, jogging in the sands of sadness
I tell you I have dreamed of my night
I lock the latches, I desire all of your access
I grew up around gangbanging culture
Drug dealers tryna get white like Sammy Sosa
Dog killers tryna suffice, and so they post up Shaq style
Raised in the jungle Amazon so they act wild
Another black child, smoking on black mild
None of them know where they from, don't know our background
Never made the dean's list, but we young black genius
Beat tailor-made, I'm my own seamstress
Can't you see I'm finna blow like Aretha
Tear your block up and I ain't screaming "jenga"
Can't control my flow, just call FEMA

I told you before, I do it for the dreamers (x4)
