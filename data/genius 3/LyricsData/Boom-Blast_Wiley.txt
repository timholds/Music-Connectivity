[Verse 1]
Boom blast, rave in the dance till the dance is done, ladies playing with my heart like wow
Got a boom heart in my chest but how
When i flow cold north pole not south (hello)
Budududadada budubudu pow!
Peace love in my heart it's been a while now
Here's three words hold it down
So right now i am gonna hold downnnnn (down)
Dddown down down down down ddddown down
The whole crowd is gonna singing aloud when im around
The fans are ma dollar a euro or a pound
Its all sound checking my new garms all grey like a hound
I live in a small town
Got a place in the city when roll through
And i wanna roll through now
I give you that feeling
Make you wanna rave it out and then touch that ceiling
We've got four hours to go and no you are not dreaming
Rave till the partys done coz that's what we believe in (thats what we believe in)

[Hook]
If we give you the feeling
That makes you wanna go and touch the ceiling
Then let's get down
Let's get down
If we give you the feeling
That makes you wanna go and touch the ceiling
Then let's get down
Let's get down
Downnnnn
