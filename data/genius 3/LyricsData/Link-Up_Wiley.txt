My girl knows that I play hard like Vash
Doubled up cash

Daytime link on a subway wrangling
People staring at the stuff that we're handling
A lot of bags I don't really wanna carry
The way we're going on we should get married

Ever since Seduction they hug me more
Other gal, they try hating, but I tell 'em this
Why you saying that I'm ugly for?
Why you tryna put next man above me for?
Why 'em galdem no love me no more?
Why 'em galdem no love me no more, cos you find new links?
