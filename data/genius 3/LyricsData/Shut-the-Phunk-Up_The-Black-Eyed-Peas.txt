[Intro]
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oahhhahhh
Shut up, just shut up shut up
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-AHHH-oah-oahhhahh

[Hook]
We try to take it slow
But we're still losin control
And we try to make it work
But it still ends up the worst
And I'm crazayyyyy
For tryin to be your lad-yyyy

[Verse One]
Girl me and you were just fine, y'know
We wined and dined, did them things
That couples do when in love, y'know
Walks on the beach and stuff, y'know
(Things that lovers say and do)
I love you boo (I love you too)
I miss you a lot (I miss you even more)
That's why I flew you out when we was on tour
But some things just get out of hand
When you start screamin for no reason
Just because I'm up in the club with my friends
Have a little trust and believe in your man
And just because I look at a girl don't mean nuttin
And just cause we talk don't mean that we (fuckin)
Word, so just shut up, shut up
Shut it up, just shut up, shut up

[Hook]

[Verse Two]
Why why why, why does emotion gotta move so fast?
Love is progress if you can make it last
Why is it that you just lose control
Every time you agree on takin it slow?
Why does it have to be so damn tough?
Caise fools in lust could never get enough
Of love, showin the love that you be givin
Changin up your livin for a lovin transistion
Girl listen listen, tryin to get you to listen
Screamin at each other has become our tradition
You yell, I yell, everybody yells
Got neighbors across the street sayin "Who the hell?!"
Who the hell? What the hell's goin down?
Too much of the bickerin, kill it with the sound and

[Hook]

[Interlude]
Don't even talk, to me
Don't even speak, to me
Cause if you keep talkin, I'mma start walkin
And you don't wanna see me leave
(Well if you'd stop leavin, I'mma start believin)
(You endin up with me)
Girl our love is dyin {*4X*}
Why did you stop tryin?
Girl our love is dyin {*4X*}
Why did you stop tryin?

[Repeat Intro]

[Verse Three]
Love is full of emotion and games
A thin line between good bad and insane
People goes through this just to obtain
A perfect relationship and maintain
But sometimes things just get out of hand
We all make mistakes, ain't no perfect hu-man
Starts from a little lie on top of the other
Makin up excuses to tie your loose ends
Then you wonder why things ain't never the same
Then you try to re-erase, but it's just too late to chase
Like chasin a wonderful scene while I'm dreamin
But when I wake up ain't nothin but screamin
Yellin, fightin, throwing things at each other
Situation like this make me just wanna tell you to
(Shut up, just shut up, shut up)
(Shut up, just shut up, shut up)

[Hook]
