[Chorus]
Riding on a hurt train
Making tracks
Riding on a hurt train
Ain't no turning back
I'm out here on a hurt train
The moaning' of the rails
Seems like a sad song
Last call farewell

[Verse 1]
A hundred tons of cold steel
Rusting in the rain
The singing of the rolling wheels
Are calling out her name
That whistle keeps blowing
That high lonesome sound
It tells me where I'm going
Is gonna be a long way down

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Now here I sit loaded
Wondering what went wrong
The whiskey I can hold it
I just don't know how long
I'm out here on a hurt train
A hundred tons of cold steel
Rusting in the rain
The singing of the rolling wheels
Are calling out her name

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ain't no turning back
