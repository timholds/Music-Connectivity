[Verse 1: will.i.am]
AyY girl you know you special
Wanna jump through the phone, give you beso
Wanna hold you tight, never let go
'Cause your love's like magic, presto
Girl let's tangle up like a pretzel
Kama Sutra lovin', baby let's go
Girl, I put you in a trance like Tiesto
But I ain't talkin 'bout tech, t-t-t-techno
Girl. you stole my heart like a klepto
Butterflies in my tummy need Pepto
Bismol, baby give me more sex though
It's your pleasure like I'm Gecko
Girl, will I stop lovin' you? Heck no
Honestly I think you got me in a hex yo
When I'm with you it's all perfecto
And when I'm leavin you hit me with that text
And you talkin 'bout the XO, XO, XO
That XO, XO, XO
Hit me with the XO, XO, XO
That XO, XO, XO

[Hook: The Black Eyed Peas]
Baby, everywhere I go, I'm not alone
You let me know, you're on my phone
You're in my dreams, you're on my screen
You send me X and O's, X and O's
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses, X and O's
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses, X and O's

[Bridge: The Black Eyed Peas]
Oh oh oh oh oh

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
I've been waitin' on the phone for your text, yo
I wanna stay connected like Lego
You're the gas to my car, you're my petrol
Me and you goin' back, retro
Everytime I get some, I wanna get more
Everytime you're away, I wanna get close
'Cause the lovin that you give me just echoes
Got me dumb, got me sprung 'cause the sexo
So good, I wanna show her like a expo
I can't leggo, leggo my Eggo
You're my number one, you're my pebble
You're the only one for me 'cause I said so
Girl, you want my heart, you need a medal
'Cause now I ain't lookin for the next, yo
When I meet you it's all perfecto
And when I go, I be waitin' for your text
I be missin' your XO, XO, XO
That XO, XO, XO
Girl, you're so XO, XO-llent
XO, XO-llent

[Hook: The Black Eyed Peas]
Baby, everywhere I go, I'm not alone
You let me know, you're on my phone
You're in my dreams, you're on my screen
You send me X and O's, X and O's
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses, X and O's
Hugs and kisses, hugs and kisses
Hugs and kisses, X and O's

[Bridge: The Black Eyed Peas]
(This, is the mega love song)
(For the lovers, for the lovey-love, lovers)

[Verse 3: Taboo]
Love her, need her
Can't leave her, ring ring
Forever, liked her
Wifed her, wedding ring
We out, holding hands
Doing lovey dove
Doing lovey dove, doing lovey dove
We stay, kissing
Permanent, lips
Locking, knocking
Boots, knock-knock, boots-boots
Break it down, to the ground
Love my honey down
Love my honey down
Love my honey down
