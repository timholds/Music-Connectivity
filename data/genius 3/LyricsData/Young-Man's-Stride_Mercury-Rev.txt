It feels like coming in a dream
I see it coming in a flash
And if it comes it comes
But if it don't I'm gonna crack

Who put the kick back in a young man's stride

There's nothing like the feel
Of destruction come alive
There's nothing like a drive
Express into your mind

Who put the kick back in a young man's stride

I hear you coming with a scream
I see you coming with a flash
And if you come you come
And if you don't I won't need to ask

Who put the kick back in a young man's stride
