When the money goes, will the honey stay
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey Hey

[Verse 1]
It was all good just a week ago, shoe box full, no sneakers though
Just moved in, its been a week or so
Brand new coupe so the seat could go
White, Benz light tint riding like what the fuck is an indictment
Spend ten thousand for excitement, that's how the day goes
That's how the nights went, Louis bags, Balenciagas
The ones talked about by the fashion bloggers
You know me, I have a Murcielago
In the same lime green as the Air Max Troggers
But if it wasn't here will she wanna go?
You don't wanna ask but you wanna know
Will my baby weather the storm
Stick around till the weather is warm? Heyy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
She like shopping but never trendy, a little Gucci maybe Fendi
Island hopping the West Indies, Diddy said "it's all about the Benjis"
Key tile Philippe, Chow reservations we could sleep now
Ask how much, I don't allow such pull a air max out your reptile clutch
But who knew that the sky get cloudy
I bought a Ford Ranger, didn't think she'd be outty
Huh, the game's over, seize my Range Rover
Feds said somebody gave my name over
Now I'm inside, she's outside, what should you do?
How about ridee guess nothing lasts forever
I thought we could watch these clouds pass together, but heyy

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
You can't ride big on little rims
You wanna do it big; you need a Lil' Kim
Raise your hands high, look in the man's eye
I don't know em' your honor, can't lie
Money comes, money goes, so you need to blow it like a runny nose
On a lady who ain't turn 180, place no one above ya sweet sady
Sun stopped shining, she never got shady
She coulda watch them box you in like a Brady, but she stood up
Like what up! Its a cold world zip the coat put the hood up, thats some sick shit
That's a ill bitch when you dead broke she make you feel rich
See mama you're my Rihanna, pull the umbrella when you see drama, heyyy
