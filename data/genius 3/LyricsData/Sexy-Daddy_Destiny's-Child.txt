[Hook]
Everybody listenin' and I wanna see you dance
I don't think you heard me, I wanna see you dance
Get up and dance, get up and dance

Get up and dance
Everybody listenin' and I wanna see you dance
I don't think you heard me, I wanna see you dance
Get up and dance, get up and dance

[Chorus]
Sweetie pie, I think it's your lucky night
I'm getting buck wild tonight
I'm gonna have fun, fun, fun, fun
Sweetie pie, I think it's your lucky night
I'm getting buck wild tonight
I'm gonna have fun, fun, fun, fun

[Verse 1: Beyonce]
The girls just want to have fun, it's alright
Ladies gonna get the job done, it's alright
All we need is peace and love, it's alright
Spotted me a sexy daddy, daddy, daddy

If you do not like me, so what, it's alright
Still gonna have a good time, it's alright
I got my people here with me tonight, it's alright
Spotted me my baby's father, father

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Kelly]
Kelly, Beyonce, Michelle, it's alright
Relax and enjoy yourself, it's alright
I'm gonna dance with my girls, it's alright
Until I see my sexy daddy, daddy, daddy

Come on baby, I'm about to put it on ya
I don't think I can resist it any longer
Come on baby 'cause it's getting stronger
I'm lookin' at my baby's father, father, father

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Michelle]
It's the weekend and it's time for freakin'
Let's dance, let's dance
I'm getting buck wild tonight
So today is your lucky night
Let's dance, let's dance

Get up and dance
Everybody listenin' and I wanna see you dance
