The sky is high
So I’mma take the crown
You know I always wanted to run this town
I take your hand and we do up and go
Kids on the street, Frank on the radio

And we were always on the run
Trying to be and to become

The Sun shines on those who dare follow
The beat of the drum in their heart
There’s no guarantee for tomorrow
But it’s never too late to start
No it’s never too late to start

Now there were times when we were on our knees
And we forgot about our dignity
I still don’t know who I was trying to please
But now I know that I was always free

And we were always on the run
Trying to be and to become

The Sun shines on those who dare follow
The beat of the drum in their heart
There’s no guarantee for tomorrow
But it’s never too late to start
No it’s never too late to start
