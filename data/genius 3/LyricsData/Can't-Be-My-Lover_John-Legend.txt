[Intro: Buju Banton]
Have ah piece of body wey every good gyal deserve
But ah won't allow this girl to mess with my nerves
Blessed figure, not to mention the curves
Through the corner of her eyes she slowly observe
(Singout)

[Verse 1: John Legend]
Any time she come around
Something is about to go down
Listen to the siren sound
Wake up wake up right now
'Cuz if I was to go to sleep
Catch me dreaming of a way to creep
Trouble always seems to follow me
Oh don't follow me now

[Hook]
(Over and over and over again)
I try to tell her no no no
I already have a friend
(Over and over she's reeling me in)
She says nobody has to know
But I've got to let her go

So I had to walk on by
(She can't be my lover)
She's flashing me them pretty brown eyes
(She can't be my lover)
Though there's green grass on the other side
(She can't be my lover)
All I can say is hi
She can't be my lover
Listen listen right now

[Verse 2: John Legend]
Anytime she hear the beat
She be dancing right in front of me
Trying to lure me in-between the sheets
But I'm a man and I still get weak
But I'll be damned if I loose my girl
But I'll be damned if I don't touch her
Curiosity it killed the cat
Oh and I don't want that so

[Hook]
(Over and over and over again)
I try to tell her no no no
I already have a friend
(Over and over she's reeling me in)
She says nobody has to know
But I've got to let her go

So I had to walk on by
(She can't be my lover)
She's flashing me them pretty brown eyes
(She can't be my lover)
Though there's green grass on the other side
(She can't be my lover)
All I can say is hi
(She can't be my lover)
Listen listen right now

[Verse 3: Buju Banton]
I couldn't let you pass even if I try
Have a bird in the hand
Why chase one in the sky?
Sexy female refuse to comply
Plus she is an empress
Who want ah stand-by
Been receiving love but she can't satisfy
Would like to have my cake and even enjoy the pie
Politely decline like me shy
Honey say me soft, come on give it a try
Look in ah me eyes with seductive eyes
Fill with deception trouble and lies
And ah doh want no more problems in-a meh life
Ask me fi me number so that we could enjoy the night

[Hook]
(Over and over and over again)
I try to tell her no no no
I already have a friend
(Over and over she's reeling me in)
Nobody has to know
But I've got to let her go

So I had to walk on by
(She can't be my lover)
She's flashing me them pretty brown eyes
(She can't be my lover)
Though there's green grass on the other side
(She can't be my lover)
All I can say is hi
(She can't be my lover)
