[Hook]
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
I got this here, I got this here, nigga I got this here
Big backyard with a house on the hill
Old school whip with some big ass rims

[Bridge]
Fuck these haters, fuck these hoes

[Verse 1]
Well I suppose niggas gon' hate on me
Well that's cool
I got shows, getting money I can barely fold
Cause that's what I do
And ain't nobody gon' pimp K-R-I-T
Yea, that's how I feel
And them diamonds niggas always rhyming 'bout
Pressed against my wheel
And ain't nobody gon' check none of me or mine
In God I trust
If you think I'm out here tricking these hoes
You got me fucked up
And ain't no playing in the south, turn a bad bitch out
When I grab my pipes
Y'all niggas think this shit came oh so easy
It wasn't over night, but

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Now I suppose I'm doing quite alright
Ever since I blew
Don’t be worryin' bout me an don’t worry bout mine, player
Worry about you
And ain't nobody gon' block my shine today
With the roof gone
I got a top notch bitch, you need something like this
But you gotta get your own
And ain't nobody gon' wreck this hard
When I'm traveling down the boulevard
Now they hollering out "Oh my God!"
Cause they never seen rims this large
"That's country shit"
Well that's cool cause I'm country, bitch
I never turn my back, I burn on wax
And stack my cash 'til I'm country rich, cause

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I got this here, I got this here
Chevys on that chrome
Live and in my zone
'Til a player gone
I got this here, I got this here
Doing it how I feel
Doors open for hoes
Haters in my grill
I got this here, I got this here
Diamond in the back
Slamming on these doors
Trunk beat 'til it crack
I got this here, I got this here
Get it how I live
Smoking on that good
Cracking on my seal

[Hook]
