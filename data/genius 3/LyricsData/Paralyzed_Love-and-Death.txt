[Verse 1]
Why is my love so cold?
No more will I pretend
Gasping for air as you're slipping through my fingers
Don't kiss me goodbye, please don't leave here

[Chorus]
I'm dying inside (knowing it's my fault)
Crying with my (fist against the wall)
Can't get away
I swear I'm gonna break
I'm paralyzed, I need you now

[Verse 2]
The smell of sacrifice
Your disappearing whispers
I cannot grasp how my life inside just withers
Don't kiss me goodbye, please don't leave here

[Chorus]
I'm dying inside (knowing it's my fault)
Crying with my (fist against the wall)
Can't get away
I swear I'm gonna break
I'm paralyzed, I need you now

I need you
I need you now
I need you

[Bridge]
Death before I give dishonor
Death before I disobey
Death before I give dishonor!
Death before I disobey!
DISOBEY! DISOBEY!

[Chorus]
I'm dying inside (knowing it's my fault)
Crying with my (fist against the wall)
Can't get away
I swear I'm gonna break
I'm paralyzed, I need you now

I need you now
