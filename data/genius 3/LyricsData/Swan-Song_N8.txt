Not always the one you want
Though you’re what I need right now
We are both confused and lost
Too afraid to settle down

Slow it down now
So I might see you clear
Back away from
Shallow my fear

Want to feel like I am done
Want to feel like I’m a part

Break it down now
Think I’ll disappear
Should we break ties?
Can I keep you here?

I really want to
Lose all of myself to
Becoming a part of
Someone like you

I am so much better off
After spending time with you
Seeing myself clear for now
See it the way that you do

Now that it’s all gone
Tell me it’s over
Tell me it’s all gone
I’ll be your shoulder
