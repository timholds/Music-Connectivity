You are now listening to
Girls Over Guns
Its a gyal dem ting
Bomboclat
Yeah, Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Its a gyal dem ting

[Hook]
Say when I fly you fly, we fly together
And when I shine you shine, we shine together

[Verse 1: Kano]
Ah, Tell Siri text her 'Looking pretty'
And leave a wink wink on the end something silly
Yeah I get mine headline like I'm Drizzy
But you don't love hype fuck Shyne like a Diddy
As long as I got my boo
Them other girls cool but they're not like you
Winter time swagger you rock high boots
Borrow you my jacket when the Fahrenheit falls
Gentleman, I follow them Bronx Tale rules
She's the open the door from the inside sort, ask Sonny
And when we fine dine spend money on the food
She said the black cod's nice but the oxtail rules
Yeah she's no Cinderella
The Roly struck twelve still fly no feathers
Dropped her the philosophy
My nigga told me 'Would you rather live like a Queen right now or a Princess forever?'

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kano]
Sugar cane babe give you that sweet
Two veg yeah give you that meat
And when I say this I ain't talking about drinks
Montego Bay, sex on the beach
And its girls over guns, cha
You dun know its bosses over bombs, huh
You're ginger I'm De Niro
Be Petrelli I'm your hero
Call me Neo 'cos believe me I'm the one, hon
That I wanna call ya
Baby you're my bestie
Text me in the morning, x-x-x me
And when I reply spell check don't correct me
I fucking love you, cooked breaky

[Hook]
Say when I fly you fly, we fly together
And when I shine you shine, we shine together
Say when I fly you fly, we fly together
And when I shine you shine, we shine together

[Verse 3: Scorcher]
Ay yo when I fly fly you fly
Rap for the blue sky
Holloway to Heathrow, night flight Dubai
Huh, I'm a criminal honey but I'm the smooth type
Baby I'll give you my nine like my shoe size
Yeah you know its girls over guns though
But I'm still on the road, so I can smell the gun smoke
Look I sky walk but I never run though
When they tell me that ???, I just say you dun know
Halo, Halo I can see your Halo
You know who I'm chatting about when I'm on the radio
Just another boyfriend, ???
Meet me on a double date with Kane 'cos I'm able
Big stallion I'm coming straight from the stables
Big man ting I'm putting plates on the table
We're living in a world full of sinners
But when I fly you fly, babe you're my angel

[Hook]
