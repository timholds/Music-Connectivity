The little girl she comes running home from school
She's lost her first public fight
She's so upset as she wipes away her tears
She can't concentrate on her homework that night
And finally when she gets her homework right
Her daddy knows that somethings wrong
But decideds to leave the questions utill later on

And later on at the little girls request
That she go to bed early to rest
Like a weeping willow
Into her sleeping pillow she cries

The little girl is growing up
While her whole world it is falling down
I wish this hurting it could stop
But she's only learning

Her daddy gets up late for work
He's got a cigerett hanging from the corner of his mouth
He's late, he's missed that train again
Oh, total shock
And finally when he gets to work
All his fears deliverd with one blow
The boss says, with a smile
I'm sorry but you'll have to go

The little girl is growing up
While his whole world it is falling down
I wish this hurting it could stop
But she's only learning

The little girl is growing up
While her whole world it is falling down
I wish this hurting it could stop
But she's only learning

(sax solo.....)

The little girl she makes it to school
She meets up with a friend
They both pretend
They want to be the teachers pet again
And finally when she makes it home
She doesn't know what is wrong or right
Should she tell her mamma
Or should she keep quiet

The little girl is growing up
While her whole world it is falling down
I wish this hurting it could stop
But she's only learning

The little girl is growing up
While her whole world it is falling down
I wish this hurting it could stop
But she's only learning

The little girl is growing up
While her whole world it is falling down
I wish this hurting it could stop
But she's only learning
She's learning, learning
She's learning, learning
She's learning, learning
She's learning, learning
Growning up
Growing up
Growning up
