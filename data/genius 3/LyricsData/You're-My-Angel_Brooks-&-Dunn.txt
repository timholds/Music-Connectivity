[Verse]
You're my angel, you see me through
Believe in me, I'll believe in you
Oh, fill my heart from, your lovin' well
You're my angel

[Verse 2]
Pick me up when, I'm feelin' down
When I stumble, on shaky ground
Oh, you're my answer, when I can't tell
You're my angel

[Bridge]
Oh, you take me up to heaven
When you spread your lovin' wings

[Verse 3]
When I am weary, and way behind
When I am clearly, out of my mind
Oh, when I find I'm, in my own hell
You're my angel

[Outro]
Oh, you're my angel
