I was sittin' at the cafe for a bite
And couldn't help but overhear this guy
He just pulled up in a U-Haul truck
Tell Becky how pumped he was

'Bout movin' here for his new job
And what a cool little spot it was
It kinda made me jealous, it made me mad
Wish I could see this place like that

Yeah, I wish I was new to this town
Just pullin' in, and checkin' it out
For the first time, wish I could go anywhere
And not be afraid of finding you there
Yeah, girl, when I see you around
I wish I was new to this town

I can't put my feet on this sidewalk
Without hearing you laugh, and hearing you talk
And every street's a memory
Of just how good it used to be

I can't walk into the corner bar
Without asking how you are
And how you're doing, and how you've been
I gotta go through it all again

I wish I was new to this town
Just pullin' in, and checkin' it out
For the first time, wish I could go anywhere
And not be afraid of finding you there
Yeah, girl, when I see you around
I wish I was new to this town

I wonder what it feels like to hop in my truck
Not think about us, just go for a ride
And stop at that stoplight, not think about you
Sittin' here by my side

Yeah, I wish I was new to this town
Just pullin' in, and checkin' it out
For the first time, wish I could go anywhere
And not be afraid of finding you there
Yeah, girl, when I see you around
And I feel the way that I do now
Oh, I wish I was new to this town

I wish I was new to this town, oh, yeah
I wish I was new to this town
Oh, yeah
