When I think of you (smile)
You make me smile
Sometimes you make me smile
I can feel you
I'm missing you

Where is my heaven?
Where can you be?
How do I get there?
Do I believe?
Where is my sunshine?
Where is your light?
I wanna see you
So you can make me smile

Sometimes you make me smile
Sometimes you make me smile
Sometimes you make me smile
I can feel you
I'm missing you

The most fragile part of me
Nurses our strongest connection
You live in my memory
With a philosophy
That now offers me completion
I'm so well
And it's strange to be
I'm torn by misdirection
You're my ambassador
You personify my admiration
So beautiful
I live for you
As you live for me

This is such a happy ever after
You traveled miles
Now we're past the finishing line
We're starting on time
My music wears your name
If they knew where to look
They'd find it
You showed me
I am I
Because you be
Forever
So magnificent
The most amazing story I ever told
So much more to be written
Thank you

Sometimes you make me smile
Sometimes you make me smile
Sometimes you make me smile
I can feel you
I'm missing you
My love
My Love
Love
Missing my love
I know I can hear you
I'm missing you

I only pray my skin be as soft as yours
My wisdom flow so fluidly from my mind
My eyes speak so truly of my spirit
And my laughter speak the clarity of time
You were once the I that's now missing you
You were once the baby born
And you had dreams of making a difference in the world
My journey was formed
I feel you
(I feel you)
I hear you
(I hear you)
I see you
(I see)
I believe in you
(I be)
But I cry
(I)
I cry
(I)
My light
(My light)
My light
My light
My light
My light
