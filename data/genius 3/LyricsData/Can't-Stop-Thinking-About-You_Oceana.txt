Can't stop thinking about you (x4)
I'm out with my friends enjoying myself but
I can't stop thinking about you
It's driving me insane, just tagged to my brain
And I can't stop thinking about you

You got me singing ohhhh ohh hoo
Can't stop thinking about you
You got me singing ohhhh ohh hoo ohh ohh
Can't stop thinking about you

Now I'm chilling and I'm playing
Why you're messing with my feelings
They're making stop thinking about you
Still don't think you get me weak
Going up me on my feet
And I can't stop thinking about you

You got me singing ohhhh ohh hoo
Can't stop thinking about you
You got me singing ohhhh ohh hoo ohh ohh
Can't stop thinking about you (x3)

You should pay for the pain
But still feel the same
You don't know what I'm going through
Feels good, feels bad
I'm happy and sad
Like a drunk I'm hooked on you
I hate this feeling

Ohhhh ohh hoo
Can't stop thinking about you (you got me singing)
Ohhhh ohh hoo ohh ohh
Can't stop thinking about you

Can't stop thinking About You (x4)
Can't stop thinking About You (x2)
