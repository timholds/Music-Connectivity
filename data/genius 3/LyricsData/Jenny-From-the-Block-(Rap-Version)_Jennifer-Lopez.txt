[Intro: Trevor Williams]
Children grow and women producing
Men go working, some go stealing
Everyone's got to make a living

[Verse 1: Jadakiss & Styles P]
L-O-X... J.Lo...
Yea, yea, yo, yo
We off the blocks this year
Went from a little to a lot this year
Everybody mad at the rocks that I wear
I know where I'm going and I know where I'm from
You hear LOX in your ear
Ea we're at the airport out
D-Glock from the block where everybody air-forced out
With a new white Tee you fresh, nothing phoney with us
Make the money, get the mansion, bring the homies with us

[Chorus: J. Lo]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still - I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from (from the Bronx!)

[Chorus: J. Lo]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still - I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from (from the Bronx!)

[Verse 2: J. Lo]
From "In Living Color" to movie scripts
To "On the 6" to "J.Lo" to this
Headline clips
I stay grounded as the amounts roll in
I'm real I thought I told ya (I'm Real)
I'm really been on Oprah (I'm Real)
That's just me
Nothing phony don`t hate on me
What you get is what you see, oh

[Chorus: J. Lo]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still - I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from (from the Bronx!)

[Verse 3: J. Lo]
I'm down to earth like this
Rocking this business
I've grown up so much
I'm in control and loving it
Rumors got me laughing kid
I love my life and my public
Put God first And can't forget to stay real
To me it's like breathing, yeah

[Chorus: J. Lo]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still - I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from (from the Bronx!)

[Verse 4: Jadakiss, Styles P & Trevor Williams]
Yo, it take hard work to cash checks
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got their assets
You get back what you put out
If even if you take the good route
Can't count the hood out
After a while you'll know who to blend with
Just keep it real with the ones came in with
Best thing is to stay low, LOX and J.Lo
(Everyone's got to make a living)

[Chorus: J. Lo]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still - I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from (from the Bronx!)

[Chorus: J. Lo]
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still - I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know I came from (from the Bronx!)
