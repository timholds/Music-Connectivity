[Chorus]
Can you feel the lightning covering your skin?
It's the nightmare
Cause you're on fire
You went your whole life waiting for this moment to begin
And now it's over
But you're not tired

[Verse 1]
I'm having visions, infinite visions
The same ones as you
I try not to worry, but I always worry
'Til all I can do
Is wish I could stay here, feeling forever
Before I must go
Wish we could change it to before we changed it
What did we know?

[Bridge]
Ten thousand eyes and four hundred hands
And all of my arms are made of the sands
And oceans have all been dried up and left
They became the skies and then they all wept
The first time they heard the song from Tom Petty
The one where Johnny Depp plays the rebel named Eddie
The sky was the limit and then it came crashing down

[Chorus]
Can you feel the lightning covering your skin?
It's the nightmare
Cause you're on fire
You went your whole life waiting for this moment to begin
And now it's over
But you're not tired

Can you feel the lightning covering your skin?
It's the nightmare
Cause you're on fire
You went your whole life waiting for this moment to begin
And now it's over
But you're not tired

[Verse 2]
I'm having visions, infinite visions
Of something new
You feel it changing, slowly but changing
About to break through

[Bridge]
Ten thousand eyes and four hundred hands
And all of my arms are made of the sands
And oceans have all been dried up and left
They became the skies and then they all wept
The first time they heard the song from Tom Petty
The one where Johnny Depp plays the rebel named Eddie
The sky was the limit and then it came crashing down

[Chorus]
Can you feel the lightning covering your skin?
It's the nightmare
Cause you're on fire
You went your whole life waiting for this moment to begin
And now it's over
But you're not tired

Can you feel the lightning covering your skin?
It's the nightmare
Cause you're on fire
You went your whole life waiting for this moment to begin
And now it's over
But you're not tired

[Outro]
(I'm having visions, infinite visions, the same ones as you)
Can you feel the lightning covering your skin?
It's the nightmare
Cause you're on fire
(I'm having visions, infinite visions of something new)
You went your whole life waiting for this moment to begin
And now it's over
But you're not tired

(I'm having visions, infinite visions, the same ones as you)
Can you feel the lightning covering your skin?
It's the nightmare
Cause you're on fire
(I'm having visions, infinite visions of something new)
You went your whole life waiting for this moment to begin
And now it's over
But you're not tired

(I'm having visions, infinite visions, the same ones as you)
Can you feel the lightning covering your skin?
It's the nightmare
Cause you're on fire
(I'm having visions, infinite visions of something new)
You went your whole life waiting for this moment to begin
And now it's over
But you're not tired
