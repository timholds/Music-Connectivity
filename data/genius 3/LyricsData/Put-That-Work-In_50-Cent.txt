[Hook]
It's a natural progression
First you cut a nigga then you gun-butt a nigga
Then you pull the trigger, put that work in, put that work in
Make it hot, it die down do that shit again

[Verse 1]
You know my aunt killed my dog and never said sorry
Niggas broke in my crib and they stole my Atari
Man, niggas could've asked, I would've let 'em hold a cartridge
I wasn't fucking with nobody, see how niggas start shit
Instead selling crack I could've been Tiger Woods
But they ain't got no fucking golf courses in the hood
I said I'm selling dope, I don't regret shit
I'm selling dope, nigga, that good shit
I was supposed to be an A student, a valedictorian
Instead I'm in special ED trying to fuck, I'm horny
They didn't like my style, they said they didn't like my style
Them same bitches want me now
In came the cash, out with the cocaine
Virgin Mary medallion hanging off my rope chain
Four finger ring, nigga doing his thing
You get a couple bitches after you get the bling

[Hook]
