[Intro: Astro]

Message from the Don:
Stay away from the police y'all

[Verse 1: Astro]

Ayo ain't nobody messing with my click clack
Sit back and watch me dominate in the net
Internet raps f*ck what them comments say
I'm raps hero, get the cheese with no delay
Ocky couldn't stop me, devour
For 24 hours my corner got me
Timbos, beef, broccoli
Them BK n*ggas turn beginners into sprinters
None of y'all can serve us
Phonies sell they souls for rising
I'd rather stay low
Nothing higher than A flow
From up into the 8th floor we stack pesos
N*ggas thinking its heaven when they severed through your halo
We OD no beats like NYPD
NY n*ggas lacking rights
We wonder where the mace go
What happened to that Jiggy sh*t?
Y'all too fancy, y'all on that Iggy shit
Keep them silly hits give me this
Your digtal's undiggable
My flow colder than ever
Freeze computer era

[Hook: Astro]

Computer Era, Computer Era [4x]
They got the real on the back spit
Wonder where that rap live
Well here goes the answer to whatever you're asking
Its that
Computer Era, Computer Era [2x]

[Verse 2: Astro]

Nobody move, nobody get hurt
Nobody move, nobody get heard
Yout dem just a dress up in a bathing ape shirt
And some of dem wear it 'til it resemble dirt
My grade A top of the line
Them other brands just a grey day
Who fresher than mines? I thought so
I'm from the block where you can catch a bullet through your torso
We try to tour so
I body tracks sell a block I'll be back
Stop necking me if you don't get the melody
These bloggers, they don't understand, they quick to diss you
On track I brack like Obamas
Flow crazy like a trife wife
Got shells that won't miss you
It's the modern day Don
Put it where your charms
Grab the mic, drop the bombs
Pulling wifes off the arms
Computer music, Don by the way [?]
Keep the trend with tech knowledge G
Smarten up
[Hook]
