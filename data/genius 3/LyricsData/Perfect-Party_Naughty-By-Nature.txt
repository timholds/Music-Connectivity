Party is a perfect party, party famous party, hood
Party hard with the party papers
Diamonds and pearls it's a world of girls
We love the girls all over the world
Party is a perfect party, party famous party, hood
Party hard with the party papers
Diamonds and pearls it's a world of girls
We love the girls all over the world

Everybody trap, jumping wild
Everybody's braging with enough come get the, to I see my T shirts
It takes you , watch let me touch you on Twitter perfect
My selections confess

[Chorus]
Party is a perfect party, party famous party, hood
Party hard with the party papers
Diamonds and pearls it's a world of girls
We love the girls all over the world
Party is a perfect party, party famous party, hood
Party hard with the party papers
Diamonds and pearls it's a world of girls

To the perfect party and cool stripping smelling options and cush cush
You should take it break it
Sexy mama sexy mama getting brain like

You know one hundred and I near it to you
And you make my way
You're my Mona Lisa as and sex toy

Go smack it, don't be
Let's I don't smoke the
If you understand the

[Chorus]
