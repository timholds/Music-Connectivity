[Verse 1]
You wanted to be a spaceman
Now you carry books full of sand in your house
Kissing cigarettes in the back of your van
Have you heard the news?There's many more like you
Oh, Mr. Blue what can we do?

[Chorus]
It's all make believe, I guess it's always been
Some crazy dream
Oh, make believe, I guess it's always been
Some crazy dream

[Verse 2]
Used to watch the sky, yeah
Got the TV turned up high every night
When they call you up, you turn a blind eye
That's how it goes when no one wants to know the truth
What can we do?

[Chorus]
It's all make believe, I guess it's always been
Some crazy dream
Oh, make believe, I guess it's always been
Some crazy dream

[Bridge]
If you feel like a spaceman
If you dream like a spaceman
If you dance like a spaceman
Then you could go to space, man

Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
Cause it's all make believe, I guess it's always been
Some crazy dream
Oh, make believe, I guess it's always been
Some crazy dream

[Outro]
I guess it's always been, you know it's always been
I know it's always been, we know it's always been
I guess it's always been
A crazy dream
