In this dirty town there's nothing going for me
No shows going down that I would want to see
Nothing but the midnight train
In this shady street on a top floor flat
Women take their sheets down to the laundromat
And as the night falls on this town

I'm going to watch the moon come down
Watch the moon come down
I'm gonna watch the moon come down
Watch it come down

As the workmen walk home, reflected in the car chrome
Splashing through the gutters and the sand
The birds move in the rafters hearing echoes of the laughter
From children in a playground close at hand

And hands inside my pockets, staring at the light sockets
Everyone's been blown out everyone's been thrown out
I said baby baby baby baby baby

I'm going to watch the moon come down
Watch the moon come down
I'm gonna watch the moon come down
Watch it come down

If I stay out all night test the midnight train's headlights
Follow the tracks beyond sight to the bend
Now who've I got to let down, tell me somebody with their head down
Bargin' into solid ground in the end in the end, yeah in the end
Waitin for the end, arrive to the end, hey hey (guitar solo)

I said baby baby baby baby baby
Watch the moon come down (three times)
Yes I'm going to watch the moon come down
Yeah I'm going to watch the moon come down like a midnight train uh huh
Uh uh I'm going to watch the moon come down watch it come down
Yes I'm going to watch the moon come down, like a midnight train
