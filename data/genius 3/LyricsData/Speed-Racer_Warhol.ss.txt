[Intro]
Dash, speed racing
I got yellow xannies so this school bus speed racing, aye
Phone steady chirping hit the road with Speed Racer
Face a hundred blunts but I'm never stuck, still facing, aye
All red stripes, bitch, I feel like Speed Racer, aye
Blow a bag through the roof 'cause I'm speed racing

[Hook]
Skrrt skrrt, do the fucking dash, speed racing
I got yellow xannies so this school bus speed racing, aye
Phone steady chirping hit the road with Speed Racer
Face a hundred blunts but I'm never stuck, still facing, aye
All red stripes, bitch, I feel like Speed Racer, aye
Blow a bag through the roof 'cause I'm speed racing
Gas bag, blowing boof, bitch, I'm speed racing
All these niggas weak, blowing past, Speed Racer, aye

[Verse 1]
Speed racing, hit the gas, blowing loud pack
Lil flex, pull up with ya bitch, had to give her back
Cold wrist feel like AC
Bitch, she give me blow, we call it Dacey
Skrrt off and I see yp nigga hate me
Bitch, I do the dash, see the wheels paint the pavement
Niggas, they ain't flexin with the fire, feel like cavemen
Posted with the boof and she say she love my fragrance
Nigga always hating, that's a foul sorta flagrant
Lil kevali, pull on kevali, go to Maui, aye
Gang know the name, burn the rubber in the Audi, aye
Pockets feeling brighter, bitch nigga want me on the where
Credit or it's debit, bitch, I'm on it, aye

[Hook]
Skrrt skrrt, do the fucking dash, speed racing
I got yellow xannies so this school bus speed racing, aye
Phone steady chirping hit the road with Speed Racer
Face a hundred blunts but I'm never stuck, still facing, aye
All red stripes, bitch, I feel like Speed Racer, aye
Blow a bag through the roof 'cause I'm speed racing
Gas bag, blowing boof, bitch, I'm speed racing
All these niggas weak, blowing past, Speed Racer
