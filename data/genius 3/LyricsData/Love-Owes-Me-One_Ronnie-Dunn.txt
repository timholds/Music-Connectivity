[Verse 1]
I'm so tired of fightin' this fight
Lookin' ahead seein' no end in sight
Chasin' a heart that's always on the run
Gonna walk away, love owes me one

[Chorus]
Hangin' on outta habit
Can't go on like this, whoa I've had it
Leave the sad, brave, and lonely
Break these chains it's had on me
Keep the faith, someway my day will come
Gonna walk away, love owes me one

[Verse 2]
We've held on me and this poor heart of mine
Rolled the dice, put all we've had on the line
If givin' it all I've got, just can't get it done
Gonna walk away, love owes me one

[Chorus]
Hangin' on outta habit
Can't go on like this, whoa I've had it
Leave the sad, brave, and lonely
Break these chains it's had on me
Oh, keep the faith, someway my day will come
Gonna walk away, love owes me one

[Chorus]
Hangin' on outta habit
Can't go on like this, whoa I've had it
Leave the sad, brave, and lonely
Break these chains it's had on me
Oh, keep the faith, someway my day will come
Gonna walk away, love owes me one

[Outro]
Gonna walk away, love owes me one
