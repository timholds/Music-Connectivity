[Verse 1]
I'm dead heading down from Tulsa
Going back to San Antone
My baby called me up this morning
Begging me to come back home
Hauling high hopes and thin air
Losing money by the mile
I'll get there a poor man
She'll make it worth my while

[Chorus]
I was a white line casanova
A love bandit of the road
I got the one I can't get over
I miss her more with every load
I got these eighteen wheels
Singing home sweet home
I been too long gone
Oh I'm coming home to you

[Verse 2]
I ain't left the fast lane
Since I hit the last toll gate
I know she's out there waiting in that Lone Star state
She'll be standing on the front porch
Reaching out with open arms
This woman's out to get me
Shoot the dog and sell the farm

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I got a white knuckle grip
On this wheel in my hand
I'm rolling down the highway
Just as fast as I can
I'm blowing smoke from both stacks
Picking them up, I'm putting them down
There won't be no time at all
Until I'll be rolling into town

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yea I got these eighteen wheels
Singin' home sweet home
I been too long gone
Oh I'm coming home to ya
