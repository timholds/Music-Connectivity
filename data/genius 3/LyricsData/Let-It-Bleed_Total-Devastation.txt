I held in my arms
The most beautiful
Felt it's warmth
Love is painful

Let it bleed
The time is now
Feed the demon's seed
Wear the dominator's crown

Now I have the power
The most joyful
I have the whip
Love is painful

Let her drink my black blood
Let her beg for more
I see her now, I see her now
Choking

Let her drink my black seed
Let her suck for more
I feel her now, I feel her now
Choking

Let it bleed
Let her bleed
