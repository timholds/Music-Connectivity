[Verse 1: kidd prodigee]

Ok,this kid is a mastermind,write some lines to pass the time
Spit a verse while killing it and living it,that's after life
Too cool like a malmoswine but I am the hottest kind
Killing random beats so I call this meal find and dine

Hiding from society,guess im just too real for this
Don't get what im saying let me speak it like an alien
Sike naw that's my alias cause I'm not homosapian
Running like a chocobo im coo coo in my cranium
That is what they say because these losers arn't the same as him
Speaking in third person,this really is a strange kid
Oops here we go again,talking to myself again
Rapping like a maniac but talk it like a congress man
Calling in huestan to tell him they not as fly as him
Laugh at my accomplishments but I ain't a comedian
Mic in my hand,middle finger to the media
Go head you can speak it up,in my room im laughing up
Im at the top,now my haters looking up
Kidd prodigee still winning,you can look it up
Im in the building,have a seat,grab a cup
Im living dreams,sleep tight,don't wake me up
I see the finish line,check point,nike sign
It's coming to the end,might finish this another time
Cooking up ryhmes,might save the rest for dinner time
Bonfire light it up,pass the mic
