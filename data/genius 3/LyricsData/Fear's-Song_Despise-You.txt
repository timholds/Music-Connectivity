On the top of la Cienega. Staring out to the north. The whole basin on fire and no one lived, that fukkin rules

[Chorus]:
I don't care about you
Fuck you
I don't care about you

I see manchester blvd. Welfare hotel. I spent all day in jail by the Sandman Motel

[Chorus]

10,000 lawyers dead on robertson. Felt good to just kick back and look at them. We were fucking laughing at them

[Chorus]

See a man shoot a judge and bodies in the street. Some pig was sleeping in puke - Walking down Florence, trying to get some shit to eat

[Chorus 3x]
