I was a brakeman out on the Texas Line
I was a brakeman out on the Texas Line
Never had the blues
I was happy all the time

Met a pretty Mama, from San Antonio
Met a pretty Mama, from San Antonio
She had big blue eyes
That would knock a groundhog cold

She said she loved me, trusted her like a fool
She said she loved me, trusted her like a fool
But I soon found out
That she broke the Golden Rule

Then one bright night, the moon was a-shining down
Then one bright night, the moon was a-shining down
And I caught my two-time
Mama turning her Daddy down

I’m through with women, no more gals from me
I’m through with women, no more gals from me
Gon’t to hop a freight
Back to good old Tennessee
