[Verse 1]
I really really didn't wait but [?]
Lately just enough
I did it to myself this time
Better still keep moving
Better just to hold still
Better off than lonely
Better off
I really really didn't wait but [?]
We still keep our hopes up
Cannot be the same out here for everyone
Better this than nothing
Better them than not me
Better now until it comes
It comes
It comes
The earth just cracks right apart

[Verse 2]
Turns out you were a little vicious
You hit me with a flower
But for everyone for taking cheers for what they've done
They came out around
They came up for all of any other
Any other
Any other
Any other
Anyone

[Bridge]
Now that the place is on fire
How can I get around in for one I can't do
Will I fall?
Hold me hold me my enemy
Today is hard to describe not with you

[Outro]
I really really did away with [?]
We can let our heads down
It's tough to see the same old cause
Better off than doing nothing
Doing what I'm doing now
Doing what I'm doing now
Doing what I'm doing now
Doing what I'm doing now
Doing what I'm doing now
Doing what I'm doing
What I'm
What I'm doing
Doing now
Doing what I'm doing now
Doing what I'm doing now
Doing what I'm doing
What I'm
What I'm doing
Doing now
Doing what I'm doing now
Doing what I'm doing now
Doing what I'm doing
What I'm
What I'm doing
Doing now
Doing what I'm doing now
Doing what I'm doing now
Doing what I'm doing
What I'm
What I'm doing
