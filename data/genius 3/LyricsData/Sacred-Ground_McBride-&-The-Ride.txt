[Verse 1]
We got married in high school
Had a baby when we turned eighteen
I bagged groceries in the daytime
At night I learned to fix TV's
When you come by things the hard way
Well you learn how to hold on tight
So don't think you can waltz in here
And take her without a fight

[Chorus]
This ain't just some neon love come lately
It's a precious thing you don't know nothing about
We were joined in the eyes of the Lord
In the eyes of our whole town
Why don't you leave her alone
You're treadin' on sacred ground

[Verse 2]
I guess I took for granted
She would never look at someone else
Now I've got some patchin' up to do
Oh and I don't need your help
I know you're the leavin' kind
Well I sure hope you will
Before she goes and burns those bridges
It took so long to build

[Chorus]
Oh this ain't just some neon love come lately
It's a precious thing you don't know nothing about
We were joined in the eyes of the Lord
In the eyes of our whole town
Why don't you leave her alone
You're treadin' on sacred ground

[Tag]
Go on and leave her alone
Why don't you leave her alone
Go on and leave her alone
You're treadin' on sacred ground
