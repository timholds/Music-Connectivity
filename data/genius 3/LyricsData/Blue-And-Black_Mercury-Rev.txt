I see blue
I see black
I see you
In a crack

I see snow [icy snow?]
I see cold [icy cold?]
I see someone
Getting old

And it's cold outside
So cold outside

I need pink
I need green
I need someone
Who sews up seams

I need everything

But it's cold outside
So cold outside

I see all the colors of the spring
I see you wearing my ring

And it's warmer outside
It's so much warmer outside

And it's warmer

Still you're there

I see you
In a crack
Crack...
Crack...
I will crack
