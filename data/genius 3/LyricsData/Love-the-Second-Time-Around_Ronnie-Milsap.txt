This time I won't be dressed up in a coat and tie
And you won't be wearing a wedding gown
There won't be a big reception at your folks house
But it's love we know it's real love the second time around

It's love the second time around
We won't be someone's ex anymore
It's love the second time around
A brand new life is knocking on our door

We both know for better or worse can sure get bad
And without love the tie that binds can't come unwound
But in each other we found satisfaction
And it's love we know it's real love the second time around

It's love the second time around
We won't be someone's ex anymore
It's love the second time around
A brand new life is knocking on our door

'Cause we found love the second time around...
