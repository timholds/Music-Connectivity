(Mike)
I'm a player..... Girl I thought you knew
When you started messin around with me, knew I wouldn't commit to you
Cause I'm a player...... And I know you can't see it in my eyes......
Everyone says that I'm innocent, and it should come as no surprise....
That I'm a player........... And I really think you need to know
That I can't love you right now baby, 'cause I need more time to grow.......

(Hook with Mike's adlibs)
But when I do get ready to settle down....
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
Oh....... When I do get ready to settle down
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
But until then.........

(Daron)
I'm a player, and I've traveled all around the world
I've broken many hearts, and it really hurts to say this to you girl
But I'm a player........ And it's kinda sad that it has to be this way
But I don't wanna lock you down until I'm ready, so right now, I'm gonna play......

(Hook x2 with Daron's adlibs)
But when I do get ready to settle down....
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
Oh....... When I do get ready to settle down
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
But until then.........

(Hook with Mike's adlibs)
But when I do get ready to settle down....
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
Oh....... When I do get ready to settle down
Baby the first one I'm calling is you
But until then.........
