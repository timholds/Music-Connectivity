Our path was set in stone
Many years ago
Forefathers of the past
Paved the way we know
We'll carry the burning flame
With honor and pride
So all you faithful leagions
Together we will ride

We unite, we are one
We will fight, this is a call to arms
Strenght and pride, is on our side
We wan't fall, this is a call to arms

We are the chosen ones
No one can deny
The gods have spoken loudly
Hear our battle cries
We come from an ancient future
Prepared to attack
A force to be rockoned with
We won't back down

We unite, we are one
We will fight, this is a call to arms
Strenght and pride, is on our side
We wan't fall, this is a call to arms

We unite, we are one
We will fight, this is a call to arms
Strenght and pride, is on our side
We wan't fall, this is a call to arms
We unite, we are one
We will fight, this is a call to arms
Strenght and pride, is on our side
We wan't fall, this is a call to arms
