[Verse 1: Ashley Monroe]
I could go out tonight and find some stranger
It wouldn't be wrong, no, it wouldn't be wrong
'Cause it ain't no crime, no felony
There ain't no chains here holding me down, holding me down
There ain't no place here on this earth I'd rather be
So why would I leave

[Chorus: Ashley Monroe & Ronnie Dunn]
I could want somebody else
I could need somebody else
I could love somebody other than you
But I don't want to

[Verse 2]
[Ashley:]
There's no good help there for me now
There's nothing I can't do without
I can't live without
[Both:]
You make me feel like heaven's pouring down on me
[Ashley:]
I know I'm free

[Chorus: Ashley Monroe & Ronnie Dunn]
I could want somebody else
I could need somebody else
I could love somebody other than you
But I don't want to
I could dream somebody else
[Ashley:]
Be treated like a queen by someone else
I could love somebody other than you
But I don't want to

[Tag]
[Ronnie:]
I don't want you to leave
[Ashley:]
I could want somebody else
[Ronnie:]
I could want somebody
[Ashley:]
I could need somebody else
[Ronnie:]
I could need somebody
[Ashley:]
I could love somebody other than you
[Both:]
But I don't want to
I could dream somebody else
[Ashley:]
Be treated like a queen by someone else
[Both:]
I could love somebody other than you
But I don't want to
[Ashley:]
I don't want to
[Ronnie:]
I don't want to
[Ashley:]
I don't want to
[Ronnie:]
Ohhhh
[Ashley:]
I don't want to
