Stayed up all night
Lightning bugs were bright
And the air turned cold and black
A turtle trapped on its back
And waiting for nothing
Waiting for nothing
Waiting for nothing
Waiting for nothing
Waiting for nothing
Rising from the earth
Measuring the worth
And the fog gets thick and wet
Gonna get worse i bet
Im waiting for nothing
Im waiting for nothing
Im waiting for nothing
