(Intro)
Supply every need that your body desires
I'll do
Anything for you
Yeah
I'll do anything

(Do anything)
I'll do anything
Anything you want me to
And everything that I will do
Do do do do do

You walked into the room
And the smell of you're perfume
Said that it's on
And I'm so excited
Ooh, the look you gave to me
That those other guys can't see
Says that you're going home
And I'm invited

If you're requesting some company tonight
Someone to hold you tight
Well that's me baby, baby
I won't make promises
If I can't deliver
So I'll do whatever
To keep you satisfied, girl

1 - I'll do anything
To keep you satisfied
Tonight, tonight
I'll do anything
To keep you next to me
Tonight

Don't you hesitate
When you have fantasies
Tell me how I can please
And I'll do it, I'll do it
I'll nibble on your negligé–‘
Uhh, then I might just stop
And work my way down
From your neck to the floor
And lick my way up to the top

You don't have to question
If I'm under your spell
But, oooh, if you want Montell
Then just turn it on over
Now there's no pressure
You can take your time
But please make up your mind
If you wanna be satisfied

Repeat 1

If you're requesting my company tonight
Someone to hold you tight
I will (supply every need that your body desires)
I, I won't make promises if I can't deliver
But baby I promise if you surrender
That I'll keep you satisfied
Oh baby
Tell me what you want
What you need
And I'll tell you what I'll do
(Supply every need that your body desires)
Baby I'm doing this just for you
Hey girl
I said I'll do it...

Repeat 1 w/ad-libs to fade
