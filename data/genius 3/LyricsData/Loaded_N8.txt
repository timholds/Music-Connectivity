Life slips fast away from me, faster as it speeds
This is what it means, so beautiful…
I am not afraid, to take your breath away
Careful where you lay, your colors show

[Chorus]
The world is cold, we are the same
Take us both, we are to blame
Live by the gun, and die the same
Live right now, live for today

I am finally complete, very hard to breathe
Feeling what you bring, is so hurtful…
You cannot believe, this is what I see
Take your self-restraint, and let it go

Hold your tongue, find a way
You mean everything to me
While the bullets scream…
Over me

So loaded

Hear my heart begin to beat, slower on repeat
I’m becoming, too comfortable
Take it all away, almost everything
I could ever be, I owe to you

[Chorus]
