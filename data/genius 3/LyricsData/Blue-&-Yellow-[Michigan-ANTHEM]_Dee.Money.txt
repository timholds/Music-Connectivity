[Hook:Wiz Khalifa ft Dee.Money]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screamin' that's nothin'
What I pulled off the lot, that's stuntin'
Reppin' my town when you see me you know everything
Blue and yellow [x4]
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds I'm in
Blue and yellow [x4]
