[Verse 1]
Doing time in my mind for another petty crime
It's a sign
Don't think I'll ever fall in line to the system
I'll just diss 'em
I'm on a mission, trying to get a bit of recognition

Lack of nutrition, I feel half dead
Got a lot of ambition but I never go to bed
And I'm bored of comparisons
Jumping the gun
People need to learn to have just a bit of fun

Fuck all that said I wouldn't make it at school
Going 'round saying Rat Boy's a fool
And I've never been cool, never played by the rules
And I spend my time hanging out in the halls
Contemplation, in a messy situation
In a Nike Air nation with no imagination
Feel I'm on my own, never been a clone
Not much to do when all my mates are stoned
(Yeah)

[Hook]
They caught up with my mind, but I'm over it
If they're into it I'll go with it
They caught up in my mind, but it's over

[Verse 2]
They say looking is the curse
But the curiosity of not knowing makes it worse
Me vs my mind blind winner
Everyday type of sinner
And I look at myself and know I'm just a beginner
Do you ever feel like your minds playing tricks on you?
In a situation you don't know what you're gonna do
Keep stringing on and I know it's in my head
The spoon-fed widespread so unsaid it's Judge Dredd
(And you see them coming for us now)

[Hook]
They caught up with my mind, but I'm over it
If they're into it I'll go with it
They caught up in my mind, but it's over

(Cover down, cover down, cover down, cover down)

[Bridge]
And all the people wait in line
To see the next crucified
In love, and life, and pain, and shame
Our lives are owned by fame in this game

(Yeah okay
We're gonna go one last time around
I wanna see your hands in the motherfucking air)

[Hook]
They caught up with my mind, but I'm over it
If they're into it I'll go with it
They caught up in my mind, but it's over
