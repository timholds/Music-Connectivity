I want a revolution
And say f*ck off to fashion
I want a real solution
Hold on something
Right Here, right now
Get down to earth and move on
I´m gonna lose control, I wanna f*ck it all up
Say it, out loud
Open your mind to the crowd
Losing it all
Yeah ! I´m gonna smash it all and puke it up
Losing it all, and after all
Yeah ! I wanna kick their ass and beat them up
Losing it all. Count up to four !
I don´t need your affection
But do I get the option ?
This is not my religion
Hold on something
Right Here, right now
Get down to earth and move on
I´m gonna lose control, I wanna f*ck it all up
Say it, out loud
Open your mind to the crowd
Losing it all
Yeah ! I´m gonna smash it all and puke it up
Losing it all, and after all
Yeah ! I wanna kick their ass and beat them up
Losing it all. Count up to four !
Yeah ! I´m gonna smash it all and puke it up
Losing it all, and after all
Yeah ! I wanna kick their ass and beat them up
Losing it all
