Sadistic intent
The modern cynic
Venom spitters fatalistic
Poison seeping
These machines are never sleeping
The illusion of power
The life and the death of a coward

I know now we’re lost
I know now you’re gone
Born into this post modern trauma
Severed intentions
Tethered affection
All encompassing
Domination

The fall of the state
Division disorder
Annulled of every treason
These machines prey on the weakest
No moderation
You’re either dead or you’re complacent

No end no love no one
None of this is the truth
