[Verse 1]
Everybody knows it
But no one says a word
And in all honesty, my mind's split
But now my vision has been blurred
I sit back and watch you chasing lights
With your breath you wept, I see into your eyes
But did you think I wouldn't notice?
'Cause it comes as no surprise

[Chorus]
So tell me why do you keep your doors closed?
I think the answer lies underneath your nose

[Verse 2]
I always hear you talking
Like you've got something to prove
Trying to act like I'm listening
But I'm not even in the room

[Chorus]
So tell me why do you keep your doors closed?
I think the answer lies underneath your nose

[Outro]
Oh woah
Oh woah
Oh woah
