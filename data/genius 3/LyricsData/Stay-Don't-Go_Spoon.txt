[Verse 1]
Keep believing the things that you tell yourself
Everyone needs something they can tell themselves
To hold on to, cause after all of it's said and done will you know?

[Chorus]
Confession is stay don't go
Ooh it is
Ooh now stay don't go

[Verse 2]
At times you find that the truth is the best way out
Ooh sometimes telling the truth is the best way out
And it's the wrong words that make you prick up your ears
When later alone

[Chorus] x2
Confession is stay don't go
Ooh it is
Ooh now stay don't go
