Have you changed your world
You changed your view
Cause what you see
Is black and blue
White on the left
Black on the right
Nothing seems to fit
On a New York night
Have you heard the news
Are you talking to me
I said "hey there honey do you like what you see"
Read about it, it never fails
We don't doubt it, it's in the mail
So you wanna be in my gang
You'd better think it through
Yeah you wanna be in my gang
You have to pay your dues
We sleep at night
On a bed of nails
All I know
Baby's got some thrills
White on the left
Black on the right
Nothing seems to fit
On a New York night
Have you heard the news
Are you talking to me
I said "hey there honey do you like what you see"
Read about it, it never fails
We don't doubt it, it's in the mail
So you wanna be in my gang
You'd better think it through
Yeah you wanna be in my gang
You have to pay your dues
