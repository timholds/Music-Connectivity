Natalie Imbruglia:
Don't ask me
What you know is true
I don't have to tell you
I love your precious heart

Tom Jones:
I
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided

Both:
And they could never tear us apart

Jones:
We could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears

Imbruglia:
I told you
Mm, that we could fly
Because we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

Jones:
I
I was standing

Imbruglia:
You were there
Two worlds collided

Both:
And they could never, ever tear us apart

I (Don't ask me)
I was standing (You know it's true)
You were there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (Come shining through)
And they could never tear us apart

You don't ask me (You were standing)
You know it's true (Mm, I was standing)
Two worlds collided (Two worlds collided)
Were shining through
And they could never tear us apart

I (Don't ask me)
I was standing (You know it's true)
You were there (Worlds collided)
Two worlds collided (Come shining through)
And they could never tear us apart
