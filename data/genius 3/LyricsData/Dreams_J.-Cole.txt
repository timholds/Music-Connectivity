[Intro: J. Cole]
Yeah, uh, yo
You gotta li—, you gotta follow me
With what I'm doin' right here, mane
Like, when I say this shit is crazy
I don't mean it's crazy like crazy
I just mean crazy like it's fuckin'—
Like it's actually crazy
Know what I mean? Yeah

[Verse 1: J. Cole]
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks I couldn't have
And then I end up fuckin' with someone I shouldn't have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated
Absolutely fascinated
With the thoughts of what she might be like
Time after time after time I had to wait and
Is fate procrastinatin'?
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause it's…

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
This is the girl of my dreams
Yeah, and is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 2: J. Cole]
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard
Aye, tell me, is it stalkin' if I follow her
Like, all the way home without her knowin'?
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay at
Besides, when I'm with her, this gon' be the spot we lay at
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside, she'll wave at me
Imagine what she'll say to me
This ain't no time to be afraid no more, it's time for bravery
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy

[Verse 3: J. Cole]
Look, I spot her walkin' in the mall
Okay, it's time to grow some balls if she really gon' be yours
Oh my God, I'm walkin' towards her
My mind's screamin' stop
But my legs keep walkin' forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you comin' for her!
My heartbeat racin', and my hands keep shakin'
Say somethin', you shy motherfucker, she's waitin'!
"What's up, girl? Don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women, but
You from my dreams
And will you come true?
I know about a show that we can catch
Some R&B and rap, and you should come through."
She said, "Uh, I'd love too
Except I don't like rap
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't really think my man would like that." (Damn, Damn)
Okay, you say you got a man
I mean, I definitely understand
I'm happy for you, really am
I couldn't have been the only fan
In the world of a girl like you
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's a very nice dude
It ain't no biggie
Well, I'm sure that I'm gon' see you 'round the city
Only thing I ask, if shit don't work out for y'all
Then don't forget me
And don't act like a stranger when you see me on the scene
I came up with a world-class scheme, to get…

[Hook: J. Cole and Brandon Hines]
The girl of my dreams
And is she good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Or should I try and get some help?
This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Aye, should I try and get some help?

[Verse 4: J. Cole]
So I find out the nigga name
Know exactly where he stayin'
Find out when he leave for work
"Hold up, nigga, is you sane?"
I'ma follow in my car; I'ma cut in front of his
Run him right into the wall
Maybe even off the bridge
I give her a little time
Then console her while she cryin'
She gon' take that as a sign
Finally she will be mine
I'll be king, and she'll be queen
When I hit her with the ring
At the wedding, who gon' sing?

This is the girl of my dreams
Is she as good as what she seems?
Or am I lyin' to myself?
Think I should try and get some help
