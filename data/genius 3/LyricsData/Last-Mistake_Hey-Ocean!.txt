Tracing the silver lines of the moon with our eyes, we both knew it was time
With your finger you traced every line every angle
Of my face, never wanting to leave this place

Time took its toll and we lost any sort of control
We once had before
Closing the door, this was going to be
Our last mistake
A quick inhale, a fast intake

We tried to take it slow but no
It wasn't an option in our state of mind
Anything that was left, was left behind

We are the only ones who knew this
Kind of love, I promise you the
Skies above had nothing to do
With it, no, no, no

With the war all around, there was no other sound
And our eyes they were stung
By the light of the Sun that was fast rising
I grabbed your hand in mine
Our fingers intertwined

Any face that we saw was
So unrecognizable now
We didn't know how every familiar thing we once knew
Disappeared
I was trying to hear you

Through the crowd of people screaming
For their souls
In a word, they wouldn't obey
You and I looked the other way knowing

We are the only ones who knew this
Kind of love, I promise you the
Skies above had nothing to do
With it, no, no

We are the only ones who knew this
Kind of love, I promise you the
Skies above had nothing to do
With it, no, no, no

This is gonna be our last mistake (We won't find out till it's too late)
I wonder if she's gonna stay (I left before he was awake)
This is gonna be our last mistake (We won't find out till it's too late)
I wonder if she's gonna stay (I left before he was awake)
This is gonna be our last mistake (We won't find out till it's too late)
I wonder if she's gonna stay (I left before he was awake)
This is gonna be our last mistake (We won't find out till it's too late)
I wonder if she's gonna stay (I left before he was awake)

We are the only ones who knew this (This is gonna be our last mistake)
Kind of love, I promise you the
Skies above had nothing to do (We won't find out till it's too late)
With it, no, no
We are the only ones who knew this (This is gonna be our last mistake)
Kind of love, I promise you the
Skies above had nothing to do (We won't find out till it's too late)
With it, no, no

This is gonna be our last mistake (We won't find out till it's too late)
I wonder if she's gonna stay (I left before he was awake)
