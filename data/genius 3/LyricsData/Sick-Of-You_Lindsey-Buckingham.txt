I wake up
To the light
From a dream I have
Every night

I’m so sick for you
I’m so sick of you
No one else could ever do
I’m so sick for you

Just a dream
But I find
I can’t keep this one
From my mind

I’m so sick for you
I’m so sick of you
No one else would ever do
I’m so sick for you

Just a dream
Nothing more
With my foot
Out the door

I’m so sick for you
I’m so sick of you
No one else would ever do
I’m so sick for you

I’m so sick of you
