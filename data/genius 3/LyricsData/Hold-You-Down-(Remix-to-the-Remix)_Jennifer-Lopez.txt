[Intro]
This is the remix to the remix of the remix

[Chorus]
Would you hold me down?
Even if the worlds against me, girl I got to know if you are with me
I'm a hold you down
No matter the situation, the whole wide world can't take us
Would you hold me down?
Even if the cops arrest me
Girl I got to know you're coming to get me
Would you hold me down?
Baby I'm a hold you down
You know I'm going to hold you down
(Damn right I'm a hold you down)

[Verse 1]
No matter what you go through yeah I got you
And no matter what they do they can't stop us
Who was the one that went all out for you?
Stashed cash in bags, while you made your move
And there is nothing Hollywood want to jump off
If there's a problem I'm-a ride Joe at any cost
I'll be the one that reps strong for you
If all else fails, I'll do a bid with you

You got the weight of the world on my shoulders
And the "X" in my chest
Man these villains is vultures and I'm sentenced to death
But your face is the best Crack at it
Raps baddest god damn it, won't nobody fucking with us
So similar to those one in the pants
Don't nobody want listen till them things go bam
Yep yeah I'm about my cash
Got my dough but then again you already know

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
This is the T-E-R-R-O-R Squad
Who else hold it down like ya nigga, Joe
I'ma spit that Ross's 9-2
Take you back when I hit you with that "Flow Joe" track
Yeah I bought you that Pun, J-Lo's the same
Young boys try and mimic saying they spiting that game
From New York to New Heights to new fights
Of course I'm out it, let's talk about it
Yeah you have never been a nigga, more fish
Yup first they want to love you then they want to dish
You haven't seen it all and I am not trying to stress you at all
But I have got no where else to go

Joe I never gave you a reason to doubt
And there was never a time I didn't look out
There's not a situation that we can't get through
There's never been a night I didn't pray for you
See I'll dedicate my life till the very end
Because at the end of it all I know I had a friend
So let them all believe what they heard
I'll let my actions speak louder than words

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So anytime you need me for whatever
You could call my phone
We could handle this together
Shotgun by your side in the Carara
It's all Or Nothing that's how we do yeah
I talk of everything I'm still that chick
To hold you down because my pockets are thick
Because you know I do that movie shit that runway shit
Not to compare me to your average pick

All Or Nothing how I feel these days
Hate stronger than tsunami ways
I know you know the feeling
Talking about that tabloid shit
Paparazzi they can suck my dick
Well I guess I guess they know now
When it comes to holding you down
Everybody know how I get down
Yup, yup, yup, yup

[Bridge]
So I guess I guess you know now
When it comes to holding you down
Everybody know how I gets down
When it comes to you I do anything you ask me to

[Chorus][x2]
