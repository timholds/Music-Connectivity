[Verse 1: Nas]
Yeah, laced and Macy's, don't have it, a hatred addict
I need faces mad with frowns when I'm around, or I'm wastin' fabric
I don't feel greater 'til my plush pieces cause you to suck your teeth
So mean-muggin' on my clean-thuggin' mean nothin'
Women dream I'm your husband
I'm Alex Pushkin, the black poetry-writin' Russian, ice disgustin'
I started bling, how could you question my direction
Or my Tom Ford collection? Gangstas two-steppin'
You hate me, should thank me, but lately
I burned so much trees, I keep environmentalists angry
I'm a rare dude, I'm a wonder, your best success is my worst blunder
Y'all livin' trendy on pennies, I cop plenty Fendi
Vivienne Westwood, I'm good
Get the whole Trump Tower top floor for the hood
Dre & Cool, we ridin' heavy, NY to Miami cause

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas]
We make the world go round
Now let's toast to the hustlers
We make the world go round
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas
We make the world go round
Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers
We make the world go round
And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us
We make the world go round

[Verse 2: The Game & Chris Brown]
I see the haters on the floor jockin' my swag
I'm poppin' Ralph Lauren tags and pourin' champagne inside a polo glass
Model bitches rollin' grass, Escobar unfoldin' cash
Toastin' with my entourage, went from robbin' armored cars
To all my stars, red carpet to the L'Ermitage
We throwin' red dice at the Mirage
I pull that red Lamborghini on twenties out my garage
Set up shop in South Beach like Khaled and Terror Squad
(We The Best!) Big pimpin', top down chrome spinnin'
"Top Gun", Tom Cruise tucked inside my Gucci linen
No, just Romo
You tryna shine, I put the nine on your jersey for promo
Jessica Simpson, that's so-so
Nick want his (baby back), but that's Loso
Tell Hawaii 5-0 to catch me at the Pro Bowl
On the field, diamonds chokin' the jockey on my Polo
CB, let 'em know though

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas]
We make the world go round
Now let's toast to the hustlers
We make the world go round
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas
We make the world go round
Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers
We make the world go round
And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us
We make the world go round

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
We make the world go round
From my town to your town
We on top, no stopping us now
We got Patron, the ballers two stepping
Ladies on the floor and all 'em two stepping
From L.A. to Harlem, two steppin'
So iced out, it's easy to point them haters out

[Verse 3: Nas]
We start with Bellini's and end with Patron shots
H. Lorenzo belt buckle from Chrome Heart
Alife tag popper, it'd be sad not to walk out the store with bags
Worth a hundred cash shoppin'
Violence only when have to, have to to swell you up
Prefer peach Schnaps, Perrier-Jouet, a vanilla dutch
Mets cap, that's Queens, I'm a vet, bet that
300 carats the average up on the neck, black
Paid the cost, be the boss, Black Caesar floss
Weekends at the Venetian, pull up in that black Porsche
Top down, new fashion
Seein' me is like seein' through the lens of Helmut Newton's camera light, flashin'
And I'm laughin', my plaques' from album sales
Y'all is ringtone platinum, but ninety-nine cents adds up
I don't hate 'em, I congratulate 'em
The new young Prince with young Mike Jackson on the same track, what

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Nas]
Now let's toast to the hustlers
We make the world go round
Tell the hustlers, toast to the gangstas
We make the world go round
Tell the gangstas to toast to the ballers
We make the world go round
And tell the ballers pour a glass for all us
We make the world go round
