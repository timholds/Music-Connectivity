Yo, let me have your concentration, weather you on the toilet constipated or you've to pull your dick out of a chick because your condom's breaking, if you have to get incarcerated
Listen to me rhyme while driving intoxicated while the cops are chasing obligate the population abide the compilation
Top cop a watch with diamonds the size of raisins
Let me have your cooperation cause if this song is playing on the radio to the waiting you gotta save it
But i'm the hottest topic of conversation, i want the confirmation and got the church congregation to follow satan
Confrontation with this rhyming abomination to be a doctors patient with a combination the operation complications under medical observation to find that the sick shit Mali spitting is not contagious, cause I'm better than all y'all and we can rap in the court of law to see her deserves the source of all
Stop and face that I deserve a nomination election and inauguration into the presidential occupation cause I'd be president if rap was the government, my verse is so hot you'll needing oven mits to touch the shit


You can catch Mal dressed in all red but I don't run with the clique, but you still busting a liver weather you blood or you crip, I rap solo if you don't include the gun on my hip and a couple of clips that'll make you tumble in fifth
It's like when Mal's rhyming niggas got nothing to spit cause my verse is scarier than finding bumps on your dick, I got chicks rubbing they clits while they sucking my dick and I'm humble exist, hit 'em back with a hummer with tits, got bubbles and chips but I do it for the love of this shit, cause half of my money goes to taxes the government gets
You have been caught on like niggas holding they thumb in they fists, a nigga as nice as Mal just doesn't exist, ya'll only got some of rhymes I'm only feeling some of your shit, the sun is a hit you problem got from some of your bit, but it's alright ya'll can bite because ya'll supposed to be biters cause my style is grrrrrreat like Tony the tiger, Imma tell the truth since you want me to rhyme, tell you something on my mind that make me want to rewind, I was the one, shooting in the club with the nine by blending on public in shine and said the gun wasn't mine, ya'll want me to type and hope that I fail like I was sober in jail cause before I was discovered ya'll were spitting with courage, what's the matter? I'm too nice? Ya'll getting discouraged? Scared like you crossing the border with two grits in your luggage have nightmares about Mal, pissing your covers, I'm sicker than others, I'm sick like infectious diseases, lyrical miracles like I'm the resurrection of Jesus

So pass this, motherfuckers better go back home and practice
