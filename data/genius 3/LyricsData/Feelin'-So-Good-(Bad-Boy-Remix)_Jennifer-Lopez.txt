[Verse 1]
When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me
That everything is going my way

I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened up for me
That's why I'm feeling

[Chorus]
I'm feeling so good,I knew that I would
Been taking care of myself like I should
Because not one thing can bring me down
Nothing in this world going to turn me around

[Verse 2]
Now that day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine

Like the stars above I'm going to shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm going to have a good time
Call a few friends of mine because I'm loving life
And tonight's for feeling

[Chorus][x9]
