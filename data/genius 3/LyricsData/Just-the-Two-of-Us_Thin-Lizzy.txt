Just the two of us
No one else to trust
So let's not make a fuss and then moan

We've got to take the bus
Throw for win or bust
All is lost unless we go

It's not that I think it's right
To leave home in the darkest night
But I don't think that it's wrong
Gotta take you away from
Got to take you away from home

If I had a second chance
I make better plans
But that's the way it stands
And that's the way it goes

Waiting for the phone
Something's going wrong
Like in the song, I'm the last one to know

It's not that I think it's right
To leave home in the darkest night
It's not that I think it's wrong
Well I gotta take you away from
I gotta take you away from home

I can't cope. We must elope

There's just the two of us
There's no one else to trust
So let's not make a fuss and then moan

We've got to take the bus
Got to win win or bust
All is lost unless we go

It's not that I think it's right
To leave home in the darkest night
It's not that I think it's fair
But I gotta take you away from
I got to take you away from
Got to take you away from
There
Oh I don't care
