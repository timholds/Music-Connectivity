Welcome
The doors are open, Strydes

Yo, I weren't invited here and I ain't leaving in a hurry
And that's exactly how I feel so I quoted it from Dizzee
The flow is like a heart attack, I'm cardiac arrest with it
I see them demons crawling back so I sign of the cross, I'm blessed with it
They would love to see me fail like him, they would love to see me skint
They would love to see me turn to the roads and wait for the day I visit Bing
Some think I don't deserve this, irrelevant thoughts are worthless
Cloud 9 don't touch no surface, if they're big in the game, I'm Elvis
It's me, myself and I, when I'm boxed in, I'll survive
I'll box myself out, little left and right
Left him there with an awkward eye
Music, I live this, I caught this like a sickness
And where is my witness? Music shot me down, I bleed this
Music, I sing this, but to them, it's business
When you're hot, they cherish, when the flame dies out, it's finished
This is why I'm sinning, with a masterplan I'm killing em
This is why I scheme with Jack and Arch, it's why we're winning, winning

Yeah, it's nothing but the realness
Straight from the heart
You've gotta feel this
