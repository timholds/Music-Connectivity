I just wanna be close to you

The way you look in the morning
I can see your face and your daze
The way (the way, the way)
Your silence always has so to say, to say
With you
My king is where I belong
Our castle is beautiful and strong

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you

How you own this body
Smoke your cigarette
Sing to me in bed
The way (the way, the way)
You hold me
Like you're protecting your throne
I'll be your queen
We'll fit so well
Yet near me darling is where dwell

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you

You say I'm talking and laughing
I'm not
Breakfast in bed
Have a play pillow fight
We'll hang like homies
'Cause your my best friend
I know I'm safe just as long as I feel your skin

Not that I need
I'm secure with myself
Space
Trust
And respect
I understand well

Baby, I just see such beauty in you
That I need is being close too
If near me, darling is where you dwell

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you

I just wanna be close to you
I just wanna be close to you
