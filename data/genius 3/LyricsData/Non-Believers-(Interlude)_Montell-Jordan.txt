Before we get started (Yeah, uh)
Before we get started (Sounds good, yeah)
Before we get started (Yeah)
Before we get start
For all you nonbelievers

Ya heard it first, Shaunta peels off the paper
Make it, put it in my face, watch me take it
I'm swinging with everything I got behind my logo
And don't be asking nobody where I'm at
Here the fuck I go

I'm bangin' on your cassette and CD
Let Montell through, he came to see me rip shit from the balcony
May I spray these murderous verses
Can I keep 'em clappin after the curtains
Now, who you hurtin', pick the spot
You talk about your jam being def, no it's not
He makes it hot, you know his name, that's right
With the platinum or gold, he's the king of hip-hop soul
