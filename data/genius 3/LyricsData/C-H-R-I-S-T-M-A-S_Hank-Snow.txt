(And that's why there's a Christmas Day)
When I was but a youngster Christmas meant one thing
That I'd be getting lots of toys that day
I learned a whole lot different when mother set me down
And taught me to spell Christmas this way
C is for the Christ Child born upon that day H's for Herald Angels in the night
R means our redeemer I means Israel S is for the star that shone so bright
T is for three wise men they who travelled far M's for the manger where he lay
A's for all he stands for S means shepherds came
And that's why there's a Christmas Day
( ac.guitar )
T is for three wise men...
