[Verse 1]
Wait for the chances of love
Spend every friday at home
Watch days go by
Burning desires

[Verse 2]
It's not your fault
You give them they won't
Wait for the chances
Take a year off

[Verse 3]
Give them more answers
But from above
Try for a week
Pay to retire
Faith can go wrong
Looking so tired

[Chorus]
And know that you can
Let's see if you dare
To leave all your friends out there
And know that you can
Let's see if you dare
To cancel your plans instead

[Pre-Chorus]
Wait for the chances of love
Spend every weekend at home
Watch days go by
Burning desires
It's not your fault
You get what they want
And know that you can
But see if you can
To leave all your friends out there

[Chorus]
And know that you can
Let's see if you dare
To leave all your friends out there
And know that you can
Let's see if you dare
To cancel your plans instead

[Verse 4]
And the clears taint your name
Arise through the same
And go in sainty-ness
And rise through the same

[Outro]
And know that you can
Let's see if you dare
To leave all your friends out there
And know that you can
Let's see if you dare
To cancel your plans instead
