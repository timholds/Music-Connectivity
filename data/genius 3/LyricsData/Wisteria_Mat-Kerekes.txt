Oh, what a life for a lover
I was underneath it all as you stumbled
Tell me, where did you go?

And, oh, what an end to your summer
I was bandaging your bones
I carried on
Although I know you won't

And, oh, you speak your words but you stutter
I find the cure in my heart - it's stone - and in bathroom stalls
I figured you'd know

I was hiding, where were you?
Had something to lose
I was hiding, where were you?
Had nothing better to do

And, oh, how you love one another
Wishing for some kind of hope, is that what you want?
You always seem to know

And, oh, what's it like to be under?
Yeah, I saw your face fold as you got to close
Slipping out of your clothes

I could never bare the thought
Spent all year on my bedroom floor
I've been walking someone to my car door

And, oh

And, oh, I loved you most in the summer
Now your body has been put to shame
That innocent face has gone to waste
