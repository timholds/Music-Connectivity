[Verse 1]
Say the K-R-I to your favourite artist
And that's the only reason that you came to party (ay)
Put your hands in the air one time for the way that we ballin' the way that we grindin'
And who you know flow like me
Off two mixtapes gon' blow like me
And a lame ass nigga all in my face
And a bad young shawty wanna give me a taste (hold up)
Check my footwork nigga
My music that kush I got good work nigga
I slide to the right music game in a wrap
Niggas slide the left then move back to the trap
Boys wanna know my [?]
They mad cuz they just entertain like [?]
All the young ladies like he's the best
The cocaine [?] I'm just so fresh

[Hook]
Ay have you ever seen a playa so fresh
Cup full of lean and I'm lean two step
You know I ain't from round here shawty I'm on some classic shit
Hit the club with the [?] straight nasty chick
Have you ever seen a playa so fly
I pull up to the club in a 745
You know I ain't from round here shawty I'm on some classic shit
Hit the club with the [?] straight nasty chick

[Verse 2]
Say the K-R-I-T your favourite rapper
Cuz he keep it real and he far from actors
Two step his way to the top with no crashing
Meet a hoe greet her and fuck her in pimp fashion
Nigga didn't know that his girl gon' turn
She admires my clothes my car my shoes
[?] on the 'lac know that K's the best
I'm a hustler til' i'm rich get them lames a cheque
Nigga talk a lot never really man up
Same nigga I was sittin' down never stand up
So I'mma put the pressure on em make a stop to this
Bad young shawty in the club make her rock to this
It's a sold out show when I hit the stage
I'm this close from a mil' one hit away
I got the swagga nigga who won't ride
[?] askin' themself how he got so fly

[Hook x2]
