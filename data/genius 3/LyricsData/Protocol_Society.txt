[Verse 1]
Where's the surface?
Where's the breath you need to take?
Where's the broken state?
Where's the future you said we'd make?

[Pre-Chorus]
Thanks to you
I'm out of place
Thanks to you

[Verse 2]
Driven mad by lunacy
I've heard sirens
We can fool the world
We can take it all away

[Pre-Chorus]
Thanks to you
I'm out of place
Thanks to you

[Chorus]
Baby, baby what you do
Can't fight alone
Help me, help me like you do
Stripped to the bone
I can't do, I can't say
24 blows

[Verse 3]
Cleverly he deceived them all
Cause he made them certain
Took them to the edge of town
Took their holiness away

[Pre-Chorus]
Thanks to you
I'm out of place
Thanks to you

[Chorus]
Baby, baby what you do
Can't fight alone
Help me, help me like you do
Stripped to the bone
I can't do, I can't say
24 blows, straight to the nose, 24 blows

[Bridge]
Thanks to you
I'm out of place
24 blows

[Chorus]
Baby, baby what you do
Can't fight alone
Help me, help me like you do
Stripped to the bone
I can't do, I can't say
24 blows

[Outro]
If I ever get there
If I ever get there
If I ever get there
(It hurts to go on?)
If I ever get there
If I ever get there
If I ever get there
If I ever get there
