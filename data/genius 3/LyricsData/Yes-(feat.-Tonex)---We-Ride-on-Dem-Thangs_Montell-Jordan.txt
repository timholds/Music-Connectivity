Intro
This song goes out to anyone out there
Who has been fighting temptation?

Verse I
The ice was so thin
Where I was skating
I heard you calling me and
I kept procrastinating
Does anybody out there
Know what I'm saying
Do you hear God's voice?
And keep him waiting

Pre-chorus
When everything
I ever needed
I can't believe that
You provided, the moment I said

Chorus
Yes, that's what you said
That's what you told me
You called my name
I said yes
Yes to your will
You know what's best for me
All of my life I'll say yes

Verse II
It was me, myself and I
And I admit it
But the truth is
Without you Lord
I can forget it
I'm so thankful (thankful)
For the love you gave me (you gave me)
Guess I'll never know (never know)
Why you forgave me

Pre-chorus
When everything
I ever needed

I can't believe that
You provided, the moment I said

Chorus

Bridge
Yes yes yes
Yes (don't know what to do)
Yes (I give it all to you)
Yes

Repeat chorus, adlib, vamp, and end
