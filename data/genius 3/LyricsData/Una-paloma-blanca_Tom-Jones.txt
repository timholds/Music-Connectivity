When the sun shines on the mountain
And the night is on the run
It's a new day
It's a new way
And I fly up to the sun
I can feel the morning sunlight
I can smell the new-mown hay
I can hear God's voice is calling
For my golden sky light way
Una paloma blanca
I'm just a bird in the sky
Una paloma blanca
Over the mountains I fly
No one can take my freedom away
Once I had my share of losing
For they locked me on a chain
Yes they tried to break my power
Oh I still can feel the pain
Una paloma blanca
I'm just a bird in the sky
Una paloma blanca
Over the mountains I fly
No one can take my freedom away
Una paloma blanca
I'm just a bird in the sky
Una paloma blanca
Over the mountains I fly
No one can take my freedom away
