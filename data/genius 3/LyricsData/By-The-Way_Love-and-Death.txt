[Verse 1]
My life, your death
I've been contemplating
And I let you go
As you disappeared
I didn't see it standing there
I didn't see it fall apart
And everything was so unfair
I had to walk away
To get it right

[Hook]
And by the way
I'm doing alright and you don't know
What I had to give to walk away and live again
I'll always miss you and
And by the way
I think about you and the memories
Are never gonna leave
I know I'll see you there with me
Where we will always be alive

[Verse 2]
You're gone, I'm here
It's completely unfair
And my gifts, your scars
I will carry now
Did you see me standing strong
Dying with a broken heart
From your fatality
So why'd you have to go
Why did you die

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I don't know how to go on
I hate you didn't make it, I'm so devastated
I don't know how to go on
I'm holding onto memories, dying in my misery
I don't know how to go on
I never felt pain like this
I don't know how to go on
Tell me how to go on

[Hook]
