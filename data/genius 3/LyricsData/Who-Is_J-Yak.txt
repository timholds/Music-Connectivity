And if you asked, who the fuck is j yak, well i'd laugh/
Start scratching my back, and not know how to react/
I'm undiscovered, my whole life's been covered protectively/
By my mother, my father, sister and brother, respectively/
Found it necessity, to seek out my destiny/
Until I tossed it away, like back when teams started pressing me/
I played ball, when I was about a foot shorter/
Sported a black sleeve, and didn't drink any water at quarter breaks/
I didn't break pace, or work hard to make plays/
I spaced out, dreaming of the day when I would break out//
And get called like take out, places, would fate not trace us?/
What I used to ask God about this girl I always/
Stayed out late with, wanted to make kids..../
But that was way before I even knew how kids were made, I was jaded/
Like ex-ing out the d from her name, my friends said that id be famous/
If I kept up at this game, but that was never what my aim was/

"So they telling me I'm wrong/
And if I don't have plans then whats the point in making songs/
And if you don't know jack, then you can't know whats going on/
But as soon as kids ask, what the fuck you working on, ill say/
Yo, I jus jus I just wanna be me, I jus jus I just wanna be me/
I jus I jus I jus wanna be me, and if you dont like that answer, then dont ask em who he be/"

Who is who is who is J YAK/
Whhy do why do why do he rap/
And who is who who is j yak/
And who got who got who got his back, they ask me/ (x2)

And so I give em it, a youngen born in michigan/
Until his father got hired, we hit the road like michelin tires/
With his entire empire looking much brighter, it seemed wiser, from/
The increase of house size, and the pool on the outside/
But swimmin was downtime, see life had got hectic/
As a kid, I felt neglected, my pessimism detected, infection/
As I quit messing with friends, got shyer/
Contemplated the end, so many times I grew tired of being tired/
My writing branched a year later/
The pad turned to my savior, I laughed, rapping for neighbors/
Who said damn, man, I swear that Jack's greater/
Then the radio plays, I retained " it's nothing major"/
Way too humble, quietish mumble, stumbled in rubble/
Built a bubble around myself, undetected by hovering Hubble shuttles/
I still sah sorta stutter when im nervous/
But my articulation better show em im feeling perfect, being me/

Who is who is who is J YAK/
Whhy do why do why do he rap/
And who is who who is j yak/
And who got who got who got his back, they ask me/ (x2)
