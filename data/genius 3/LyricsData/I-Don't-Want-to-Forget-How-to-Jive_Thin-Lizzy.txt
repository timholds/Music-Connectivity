I don't wanna forget how to jive
Get my mookie, keep 'em alive, baby
Don't wanna lose ya
Goodbye, a-huh, huh, yeah

I don't wanna forget how to rock
Lose, wearin' toll
Well, it show ya, oh yeah, oh well, well

I don't wanna forget how to jive
I just wanna keep 'em alive
I don't wanna forget how to die
I just cold shower

Don't wanna forget how to jive
Went bobbin' with a bip-bop
Bop bop bop bop bop
Billy bop, a-billy a-bop, a-billy a-bop bop bop bop bill bop
Uh-huh, oh yeah

I don't wanna lose ya
I don't want you
Shush my dragon
You got new chil'
Ow!

I don't wanna fotget how to jive
I just wanna feel alive
I don't wanna forget how to rock
No child
Don't wanna forget how to jive
Went boppin'...{fade}
