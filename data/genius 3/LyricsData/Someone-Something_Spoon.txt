[Verse]
Everything moves so fast I should know it won't last
Take some stock what you are what you see what you got
It tells me true I want a connection to
Someone something
Edge of a knife been missing it all my life
Someone something
They get you where you live
Don't go back you can't go back again
Yes it's true just a connection to
Someone something
Been up all night feeling like sucking an arm lite
Someone something
Everything moves so fast I should know it won't last
I want a settled life I want to be calm and polite
Someone something
I'll get this right when I get there now
Someone something
