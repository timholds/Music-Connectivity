[Verse 1: Jason Derulo]
I like the way that your body move all over the floor (na na na)
I'd like to find a way to get lost in you (yeah yeah yeah)
I wanna talk to ya, baby, say what's on your mind
Girl tell me anything that you wanna do (yeah yeah yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Ain't we all just looking for some loving tonight?
Got a crazy feeling that I fit you just right

[Chorus: Jason Derulo]
Try me in the morning when the sun comes rising up
Try me in the afternoon, bet you just can't get enough
Try me in the evening, satisfaction guaranteed
Baby, I got what you need, you gotta try me
Try me
Talk to me

[Verse 2:  Jennifer Lopez]
Let's go and find a place and get to know each other more (na na na)
It's all on your face, I know you like what you see (yeah yeah yeah)
I'm the one for you, baby, but you can take your time
Let the music bring your body to me (yeah yeah yeah)

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't we all just looking for some loving tonight?
Got a crazy feeling that I fit you just right

[Chorus: Jason Derulo & Jennifer Lopez]
So try me in the morning when the sun comes rising up
Try me in the afternoon, bet you just can't get enough
Try me in the evening, satisfaction guaranteed
Baby, I got what you need, you gotta try me
I know
I got what you need, you gotta try me

[Bridge: Jason Derulo & Jennifer Lopez]
Bring that body closer, I wanna feel your skin up on mine
Like I already know ya, I'm grabbin' that ass from behind
As we dutty wine, I got chills down my spine
As we dutty wine, girl, we might be meant to be

[Chorus: Jason Derulo & Jennifer Lopez]
So try me in the morning when the sun comes rising up
Try me in the afternoon, bet you just can't get enough
Try me in the evening (I will) satisfaction guaranteed
I got what you need, you gotta try me
I got what you need, you gotta try me
Yeah, right
Yeah, try me baby
