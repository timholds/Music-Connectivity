Yeah uh uh

Hook:
I've been around the world and every day I stay
Every time I land they talking show and A
Show and A, yeah show and A
Is show and A, yeah show and A
I'm always in the street and every place I go
They always running up talking bout the show
Show and A yeah show and A
Is show and A yeah show and A
We addicted to the story the name and the glory
The name and victory
We pay the price see the pain that has brought me
The game has thought me
Never give up so what I do is givin' more me
If not I'm back int he hood with the forty
You know the pg the .. that record me
Huh but that's a small B I got too many in the..
I'm gonna need more chips
I'm getting list
But I still have the influence
All I need is one mike
Show bang and the instruments
Same crowd same stage so you want the differences
The magnificent bitches act in ..
See I'm on some different shit
Like the way I'm ..with it
Then they start with..
The stick she shiff in it
The piff I'm piffing it
They get me energize
Thought they friend of mine
Talk it minimize
See the .. from the bronz is like stimulate
One hit get too high
Talking bout ice smooth
If that nigga fly I'm the sky
You tell me he the truth then I'm alive

[Hook:]
Fascinated by the rush that I get from being free
Plan on the level most of all you'll never see
Turned ..something most of y'all I never be kept rosing
Kept tryin be a better me
Is hard to get a grip without sleeping sleeping
I'm convinced that big brother ain't my sibling
Check the first LP
Ain't nothing different
Beats and bars then we just bar then
Can't turn bar now we too far in
She's far in, got a..she could star in
Cut nigga what you wifed in
'cause she gotta smile in a bigger..
They can't do what we do
Himï»¿ and his machine, me and my 16s
I front me up rappers who miss things
Wrong..now you'll never get me sing showing
..for life never switch things
