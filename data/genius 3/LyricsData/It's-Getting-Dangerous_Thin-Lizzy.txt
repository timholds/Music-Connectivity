The man finds himself alone
For the first time in his life
He's always got a problem
He's got to work it out wrong or right

He's got to work it out
He's so lonely in the night
He's got to work it out
All alone

Now who in the world would believe
That he's got another trick up his sleeve
And who in the world wants to know
Which way should he go

Which way should he turn?
Which way should he learn?
Which day should he stop?
Which way to the top?

I remember him when we were friends
When we were young way back then
I still can recall when we were small
How he tried his best to warn us all

This living on his own has turned his heart to stone
And it's all pain
He sits out on his own and eats his heart out alone
In the pouring rain

Now who in the world would have known
That just a few years ago
His love could have grown and grown
Through the rain, the sleet and snow

But the rain, the sleet and snow
Chills the heart and kills the soul
So the let the cold winds blow
What he doesn't see he doesn't know

I remember him when we were friends
When we were young way back then
I recall it all when we were small
How he tried his best to warn us all
I remember it still, I always will
When we were friends way back then
I recall it all when we were small
How he tried his best to warn us all
Of the danger

He said, "Watch out for the danger"
He said, "Watch out"

The man is a winner
For the first time in his life
He looks a little thinner
But he says, "Hey, that doesn't matter"

But if you look closely
You'll see a cold
Smug self-satisfactory smile
Behind his evil eyes

And now that he has won
It doesn't matter how or which way it was done
Now that he's in control
Revenge is in his heart and soul

The power is at his fingertips
Vengeance is on his lips
But the power he fought to control
Now has got him in its grips

I remember him when we were friends
When we were young way back then
I recall it all when we were small
How he tried his best to warn us all
I remember it still, I always will
When we were friends way back then
I recall it all when we were small
How he tried his best to warn us all
Of the danger

I remember him when we were friends
When we were young way back then
But now we're all grown up and we're strangers

Ou see, bit by bit, part by part
We slipped and slipped till we'd grown apart
And now we're strangers

I remember him when we were friends
When we were young, it was way back then
I still can recall when we were small
How he tried his best, he said watch out for the danger

Ou see, bit by bit, part by part
We slipped and slipped till we'd grown apart
And now we're strangers
