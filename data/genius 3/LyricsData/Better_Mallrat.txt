[Verse 1]
At the time it was alright, but
Looking back I hurt my eyes
Maybe all the angels had to fly

[Pre-Chorus]
You get a little bit high
You're looking better than I
Better, better
I hope you're feeling better
You get a little bit high
You're looking better than I
Better, better
I need you feeling better

[Chorus]
And the sun was in my eyes
But its home is in the sky
And I couldn't ask for anything
You're always on my side and
Everyone's alive so everything's alright
But maybe when the summer ends I'll drift away from all my friends
And the sun was in my eyes
But its home is in the sky
And I couldn't ask for anything
You're always on my side and
Everyone's alive so everything's alright
But maybe when the summer ends I'll drift away from all my friends

[Verse 2]
Everyone is really nice
Sugar sweet and sugar high
Wait and see if this will last the night
So I'm slashing all my tyres and I'm cutting all my ties
And I'm sorry that I even let you promise that you'd try
And all your friends are nice but you like throwing dice so
Maybe that's the reason all the angels had to hide

[Pre-Chorus]
You got a little bit high
You're looking better than I
Better, better
I hope you're feeling better
You got a little bit high
You're looking better than I
Better, better
I need you feeling better

[Chorus]
And the sun was in my eyes
But its home is in the sky
And I couldn't ask for anything
You're always on my side and
Everyone's alive so everything's alright
But maybe when the summer ends I'll drift away from all my friends
And the sun was in my eyes
But its home is in the sky
And I couldn't ask for anything
You're always on my side and
Everyone's alive so everything's alright
But maybe when the summer ends I'll drift away from all my friends

[Outro]
At the end you just got high
Now I've got an angel in the sky
Now I've got an angel in the sky
