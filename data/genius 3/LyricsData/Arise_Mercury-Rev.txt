She has a way that is beautiful to behold
Movements of silence and calm
A universe of life folded up inside her
A symphony of strangeness and charm

An she knows

Every now and them there's an ocean of silver
Concealing herself as a stream
Scars in her life that she once tried to hide
Healing themselves as she breathes

An she knows
What she knows

Feel yerself arise
Feel yerself arise
Y' let yerself go
An tell yerself you'll know when you know

She has a way that is beautiful to behold
An every now and then you can see
A universe of light splashed in her eyes
Revealing the only light she needs

An she knows
What she knows

Feel yerself arise
Feel yerself arise
Y' let yerself go
An tell yerself you'll know when you know
