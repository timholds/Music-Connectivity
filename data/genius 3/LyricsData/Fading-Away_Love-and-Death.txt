[Verse 1]
Contamination feeding the masses
Procrastination killing us all
We can see it decay and we play with it
Will we ever know
That we’re livin’ a lie
We can say it’s okay and keep fakin’ it
Will we ever know

[Hook]
Lie down and let go
We’re fading away
Time, time is so cold
We all die one day
Lie down and let go
We’re fading away
We won’t be around

[Verse 2]
This masquerade is falling to pieces
This escapade is coming apart
We can see it decay and we play with it
Will we ever know
That we’re livin’ a lie
We can say it’s ok and keep fakin’ it
Will we ever know

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Lie down and let go!
Lie down! Let go!
Lie down! Let go!

Our pictures are so clear
We’re fading away

[Hook x2]
