[Jerry Butler]
Oh, ooh, thank God for you
(I thank God, I thank God)

You were woman enough
Girl, not to try to hide
(I didn't try to hide it, baby)
You didn't try to hide your love
(I didn't try to hide it, baby)
For this other guy, baby
(I didn't try to hide it, baby)
No need to explain

Oh, I thank the angels for you
That you were woman enough
To try to make it easier for me
Well (try to make it easy)
(Try to make it easy)
(Try to make it easy)

Wherever you go
I want you to know
You happen to call on me
Then I'll be right by your side

[Brenda Lee Eager]
Oh, oh, thank God for you
(I thank God, I thank God)

For it's very nice to see
There's a man who understands
(So understanding, baby)
How hard it is to take your hand
(So understanding, baby)
And try to explain

Oh, I thank the angels for you
You're the kind of man you are
To be so understanding
(So understanding, so understanding)
(So understanding, so understanding)

Wherever you go
You happen to call on me
And I'm gonna be
Right by your side, yes, I will

Oh, thank God above
We were able to see
Just how wrong we were
Ain't understanding mellow

(Ain't understanding mellow
Could we have this love of ours)
Ain't understanding mellow
(Ain't understanding mellow
Could we have this love of ours)

Ain't understanding mellow
(Ain't understanding mellow
Could we have this love of ours)

Oh we wake up in the morning baby
(Ain't understanding mellow
Could we have this love of ours)
Oh, baby, be mellow
(Ain't understanding mellow
Could we have this love of ours)
