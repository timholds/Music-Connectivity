[Intro]
All night, be left alone
Take my name as my own

[Chorus]
So come on and take my hand, come and
Come on and take my hand, come on and[x2]
Take my, take my, take my, take my[x2]

[Bridge]
Words are not much to say
Face the, gets in the way

[Chorus]
So come on and take my hand, come and
Come on and take my hand, come on and[x2]
Take my, take my, take my, take my[x3]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Take my, take my, take my, take my[x4]
