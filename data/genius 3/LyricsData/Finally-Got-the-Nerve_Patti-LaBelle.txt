Here you come
Walking my way
So much inside me
I wanna say
I've been holding on
For the longest time
Yeeesss...

[Chorus:]
Finally got the nerve
To tell you how I feel about you
The nerve
I can't live without you
The nerve
To tell you
What's been on my mind
For a lifetime
I finally got the nerve
I found the words to say
I got the nerve
Can't wait another day
Got the nerve
I don't wanna lose it
This time, noooo...

I'm trying to make
Trying to make a connection
But I'm afraid that there
Might be rejection
On your part

It would break my heart
In a million pieces
Can't go through it (through it)
Another day
I gotta let you know
I feel this way
About you man
I just dream about you
In my life

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
When you walk by me
My heart skips a beat
I contemplate
The thought of you and me
I get weak for you baby
I can't speak
But that's how it is

I know I gotta, gotta keep it real
'cause you know how
You know how I feel
I'm wanting you
And I'm needing you
Every day

[Chorus]
