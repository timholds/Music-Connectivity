Christ knows it is easy
So goddamn easy
So come on and give me your best shot
Please criticise me
Come analyse me
Because i can take it all
Let me tell you now

I know that the game is over for me
But i am just too stuck in my ways
I suppose that the game is over today
And i am not going quietly

You know it is easy
It is so plain to see
So come on and give me your best shot
Talk comes so cheap
And i am not going to go quietly
And i can swallow it all
Let me tell you how

The game is over now
