[Intro]
It's like I'm lost
I don't know
But this feeling that I have about you
Will you ever know

[Chorus]
Secretly
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you

[Verse 1]
Whatever I see (when I look at you across the room)
Whatever I hear (I wonder if he loves me too)
Whatever I do (I just think about you for hours)
Oh baby
And it's got me thinking of you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Whenever you speak
Whenever you move
Whenever you breath
Baby
Let me touch you
Please

[Chorus] x 2

[Verse 3]
You smells so good
I just want to... kiss you
I want to... lay with you
I don't know how to tell you
