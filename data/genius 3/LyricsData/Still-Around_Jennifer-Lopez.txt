[Verse 1]
Do you remember what you said to me the day I met you
Like yesterday I still can hear your voice, you promised to be
Still in my life no matter what you had to do to be there
Well, it's been a while and here we are looking back on times that we've shared
I still imagine us being young and so in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Seems like it's always just been us

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I would be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around, still around

[Verse 2]
I still believe in all the things you said to me in those days
You gave me love and kept your word with every promise you made
I sing your favorite song inside my head when you are not with me
Until you come back home and take me in your arms and hold me
I can imagine us being old and still in love
Never apart, you are my heart
Makes me smile, we're still in love

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I would be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around, still around

[Verse 3]
Looking back through all the years
You remember the first time I went to your house
And your father looked at me like I had three heads?
We were so in love...
You were so beautiful and so young
I can't believe you're still mine, that's crazy
I love you

[Chorus]
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I would be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around, still around
I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I would be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around, still around
