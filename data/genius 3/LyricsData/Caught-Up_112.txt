Couldn't help myself
She was so fine, oh yea
I told her I had a girl
But she didn't mind
Now were gettin serious, serious
Cause I mad the wrong decision
Caught up in the middle
In the middle
In a love triangle

How'd I get caught up
In this situation
Don't wanna lose my girl
Cause she's my world
So don't get caught up
In this situation
Don't wanna lose your girl
If she's your world

She wanted me every night
To hold her tight, oh yeah
After I did the things
Her body likes, oh yea
Now it's gettin serious
Were serious
Cause I made the wrong decision
Caught up in the middle
In the middle
Of a love triangle

How'd I get caught up
In this situation
Don't wanna lose my girl
Cause she's my world
So don't get caught up
In this situation
Don't wanna lose your girl
If she's your world

How'd I get caught up
In this situation
Don't wanna lose my girl
Cause she's my world
So don't get caught up
In this situation
Don't wanna lose your girl
If she's your world

Don't get caught up
Don't get caught up
Don't wanna lose you girl
Don't get caught up
Don't get caught up
Don't get caught up
Don't wanna lose your girl

How'd I get caught up
In this situation
Don't wanna lose my girl
Cause she's my world
So don't get caught up
In this situation
Don't wanna lose your girl
If she's your world
