[Verse 1]
I wish that you will find all you need
I wish we could've been a reason for you to believe

[Verse 2]
I wish I could take the weight for both of us
I sure did try to, never wanted to give up

[Pre-Chorus]
Could we have made it, somehow?
Could we have made it, somehow?

[Chorus]
My man, my man
My man, my man
