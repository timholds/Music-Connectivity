What if i was right?

You tell me not to worry about the simple
(sounds like: crack of dawn)
It'll go away by morning
Its the usual twisting turning (sounds like: gold and plenty head)
Theres no place to go from here

What if i was right?
I've been waiting here
My life
What if i was right?
(sounds like: my was fella) finally a lie

I could put my place, man get no rest
Run through fields of glory
(sounds like: the party would be thrown together in thee faithfully)
Find the roots in everything

What if i was wrong?
(sounds like: give up everything in for my song)
What if i was wrong?
(sounds like: broke my indesicion
Broke it all along)

All along inside i was ready for it (i was ready)
All along outide i was waiting for it (i was ready)
All this time i was ready for it

Time for this to end
(sounds like: i've had hestitate to play for why?
Just a final test
I knew ever coming on it all along)
