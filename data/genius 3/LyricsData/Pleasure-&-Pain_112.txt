(Verse 1 - Q)
You Always Said You Loved Me
Though My Mind Right Now's Not Sure
You Always Were There For Me
Though My Heart Never Feels Secure
Why Can't You Take The First Step
To Let Me Know You Really Care
Cuz Now I'm Feeling Driven
Into A Love That's Not Right There

(Chorus)
Why Do You Make Me Feel This Way
Feeling Betrayed Feeling Pushed Away
Why Do You Make Me Feel So Bad
Feeling So Hurt Feeling So Sad
What Have I Done To Make You Turn
Feeling So Lost I'm Feeling So Burned
If You Really Cared You'd Make A Change
So I Can Feel The Pleasures And Not The Pain

(Verse  2 - Daron)
After All I've Said
You Still Have It Set In Your Head
That You Don't Really Care About Me
Why Can't You Seem To Believe
That I'm The Only One For You
I Gave All My Love To You Oooh
And After All I've Done For You
You Never Seemed To Love Me The Way That I Love You

Chorus

(Bridge - Slim)
Baby Can You Feel Me
It Hurts So Bad
It Hurts So Bad
I Just Can't Take It No More Baby
Girl Make A Change
So I Can Feel The Pleasures And Not The Pain

Chorus To End
