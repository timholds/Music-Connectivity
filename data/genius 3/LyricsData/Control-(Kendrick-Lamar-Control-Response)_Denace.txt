[Intro]
Wow. All I'm saying dude, if you're ready - thats all I'm asking, because I'm fucking ready to do this ok. I just need you to count me in, cause I don't know how to get my bars in and I just need to know - let me know when to come in, cause I'm not ready - well - I'm ready, but you're not ready, ready?

[Verse]
I bent up a car with Kendrick Lamar in it
I'm arsenic sent from hell with a large? Oh
You set up the bar high well I set it to Venus
The Incredible Hulk outta' control with a prosthetic penis
I'm ready to brawl machetes and all
Make a medical call tell 'em I cut em and wrapped him in gauze
Left him severed and plenty of jars
I'm a son of a dog I'm authentic
You're all fake you're all printed
Take it from the real I'm consulting it
Your wound I throw salt in it
Shit on your grave after put y'all in it
I ain't messin' around this ain't the 3rd grade
I'mma monster I cause earthquakes
Im an adoption that turned straight
I find you on your birthday, crash a Merce-Des benz through your house blasting tunes in
I call that house music
A roundhouse to your face and leave your mother's mouth oozin'
Amoxicillin to kill my sickness
Its not workin, its maybe tetanus
This may be sicker this may be what doctors never witnessed
You cowards won't never listen so listen I enter with friction and
And break the condom like AW shit I came in this bitch again
Hip-Hop is my bitch get of my bitch she ain't talkin' to you
She's on my balls and dick
Her jaws and lips suckin' like a ballsy tick
Mc's lost me quick when they watch me drip
Venom when I hawk and spit
I'm often layin yall in the coffin shit
I'm awesome when I boss and terrorize and then I off the click
You think I'm awful when ya boys think I'm awfully sick
Next to Tracy like hey baby you can call me dick
Don't you cross me bitch
Hip-Hop just lost a tit
I milked it for what its worth
Yall pussy like Barbies clit
I bomb like army vets when I map shit out like architects
Claim yall freestyle when your bars on text
I'm off beat intentionally so yall can start to bitch
About half of these rappers on the charts swallow dicks
25% should just feed themselves hollow tips
The other 25 are rarely or ever on the list
I kill mics, I drill mics into these hearts of pricks
Man fuck it these puppets are strung up
Me and Hip-Hop in a relationship no strings attached I'll have you fuckers hung up

[Outro]
Man, what? No fuckin' way. Yeah I gotta go now, I got shit to do
