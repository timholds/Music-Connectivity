( Intro : Maestro )

Eyys , eyss bring one indian roll
Mo fe fa gbon
We don tire, We don tire for this life wey we dey
We wan go higher heights
We wan reach a better place, we want to see first class trips
Its me and apex, Maestro , everybody here
Get it on a low


( Verse 1 : Apex )

Roll it up for a nigga
Smoking on that you dont need to know, Go figure
Eager, to roll another blunt quite bigger
Look at it mehn, longer than my middle finger
Nigga , Feel it in the blood clot
Tryna get it in , something like a jump shot
Seen ah girl wtih them tight ass bum shorts
Say she wanna bang, i said do it like a gunshot
E na d'ya place, Till the morning time
Ever got it good while you still on cloud 9
I just wink at her cos she know the sign
Then she blow me off my feet like a landmine
She ah bad girl but she tell me im her top one
Treat her like my car imma ride her with no top on
Alcohol good but Mary Jane better
Thats my girl never came down since i met her, never
Weed got my eyes like a cataract
If she ever go then you know im after that
Chase it like a cat tryna catch a rat
Gunshot to tha head ratatatabrat
And im just tryna go green
Manna got a lot of kush for the whole team
Take the seeds out nigga just roll clean
If you thirsty ma nigga you can drink codeine


( Chorus : Maestro )

Blood on my face , Cos if they look my way
Me na walk on by
Smoke it away, cos this reefa good
Swear na man no lie

Say me just wan get high, Me and my niggas
We just wan get high, Me and my niggas
Say me just wan get high, Me and my niggas
We just wan get high, Me and my niggas


( Verse 2 : Maestro )

We got that high grade blow
Got that migraine flow
Got that Otonna Votali
Got that ice cream toke
Its me and my team forever till that fat girl blows
TRK, double digits, we just stack and go
Words of wisdom, thoughts of high places
Fuck the same girls, these broads with light faces tho
The one i want to be with's got some braces on
Cush said its all we do just getting wasted
Sure Boi the prophet, tell you just how it is
Said these girls would always turn, No matter how it is
Bolaji said to wait, relax and then i'd see
That these girls ain't wanting love, they just wanna be free
I guess its me , the team and this here rizzla
The reefa in the joint, profess my nigga sizzla
We just put it in that Dominoes pizza and some coldstone
Till we getting higher than the big man
Feeling like kendrick in this fucking city
A toast to the niggas that be fucking with me
You can tell that that'd be the niggas that be getting pussy
And fucking bitches in the moment so they never miss it
I mean i'm getting scared
Last year i was ghost mode, but this year, my music getting everywhere
Got down with that high shit, chasing girls in denim skirts
And my girl left, and now my city feeling bare


( Chorus : Maestro )

Blood on my face , Cos if they look my way
Me na walk on by
Smoke it away, cos this reefa good
Swear na man no lie

Say me just wan get high, Me and my niggas
We just wan get high, Me and my niggas
Say me just wan get high, Me and my niggas
We just wan get high, Me and my niggas


( Verse 3 : Maestro )

Hate on me, hate on my success
But dont forget that everybody has his own address
I'm making music and getting paid for every verse
Cold world and i'm the hottest in the universe
And it went straight to my head, with all the kush in the air
Went from the butter and bread, to sushi and caviar
With all the smoke in the air, me and my team yeah we here
We at the front of the class, you in the deriere


( Verse 4 : Apex )

Feel it up, feel it in the sky
Nothing feels better than a nigga when he high
Manna got that grade a like a passed class
Round of applause girl let that ass clap
Manna need the smoke, manna need the toke
Manna need the syrup with a bottle of the coke
Manna need the spark, manna need the rizz
Manna need the filter just to roll it up with ease
Tryna light it up wouldn't stop aiming for the top
Couldn't drop even if i tried men im blowing
T.R.K we the crew that be running tinz
Eyes red cos a nigga still puffing green


( Chorus : Maestro )

Blood on my face , Cos if they look my way
Me na walk on by
Smoke it away, cos this reefa good
Swear na man no lie

Say me just wan get high, Me and my niggas
We just wan get high, Me and my niggas
Say me just wan get high, Me and my niggas
We just wan get high, Me and my niggas
