I'm singing songs about the ocean
And every night's a lullaby
To the coastal breeze and the salty seas
I've never felt so far from home
And as we cast on through these mountains
I keep my back to western skies
Where the sun it seems to always sleep
Where I wish I was going

She's the sea, she's the hardest thing to leave
I wish that she would notice, but the sea will never notice
Jolene, Jolene, that's what she sang to me
But it ain't nothing but her favorite country song

So this old van becomes a vessel
A beast of burden and a home
But those eastern shores are never yours

Where I wish I was going
Going, going

She's the sea, she's the hardest thing to leave
I wish that she would notice, but the sea will never notice
Jolene, Jolene, that's what she sang to me
But it ain't nothing but her favorite country song

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene
But it ain't nothing, no it ain't nothing
