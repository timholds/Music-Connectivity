[Verse 1]
I sat down to say it
The words wouldn't come, I just couldn't play it
And it tore me all apart
The bell I tried to ring it
The words wouldn't come, I just couldn't sing it
I used to know this song by heart

[Chorus]
I used to sing this song to you for days and days
In so many different manners, in so many different ways
I used to think this dream we shared would never come apart
I used to know this song by heart

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I used to sing this song to you for days and days
In so many different manners, so many different ways
I used to think this dream we had would never come apart
I used to know this song by heart

[Bridge]
So when I sat down to say it
The words wouldn't come, I just couldn't play it
Tore me all apart
Used to know this song by heart

[Outro]
Said I, used to know this song by heart
Said I, used to know this song by heart
