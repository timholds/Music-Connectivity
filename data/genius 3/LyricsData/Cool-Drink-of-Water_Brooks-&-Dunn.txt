[Verse 1]
I bought my girl a diamond
It was our engagement ring
She took it to a pawn shop
Like it didn't mean a thing
She went right out and bought herself
A brand new party dress
She'll be looking good tonight
When we go out I guess

[Chorus]
She's a cool drink of water
She's done hocked the ring I bought her
She might be the devil's daughter
But she's a cool drink of water

[Verse 2]
I took her to a night club
Where we used to go a lot
The beer is cold and frosty
And the band is blazing hot
I went back for a refill
And this guy walked up and said
There's a blonde out on the dance floor
Turning everybody's head

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well I'd had on too many
So she took my keys to drive
She said we'll have more fun
Tonight if we get home alive
Well that copper clocked her doing
Ninety in a twenty zone
But she didn't get a ticket
Just the number to his phone

[Chorus][x2]
