Everyone that I meet on the street tells me I look so sad
I just lost my gal and the truest love I ever had
Left the trouble in mind here behind
Lord I wish I was dead

This ravin' and cravin' around of my old heart hurts me so
I was born to be blue not a dream to come true don't know
I'm hazy half crazy
Oh where did my sweet baby go

Break (steel guitar)

I'm weak and I'm weary so worn out from cryin' for you
No use tryin' sleepin' I can't sleep without weepin' that's true
There's no one to turn to
Oh where can I find you my own

Guess I'll have to start quittin' just sittin' here singin' these blues
When I'm singin' it seems to keep bringin' old mem'ries of you
So lonely if only you'd help me
Oh what can I do

Break (guitar)

Slowly losin' my mind through these tears I can't find where to turn
Way down deep in your soul does your love hold a spark that still burns
Please don't roam come on home
Mend this broken old heart that still yearns
