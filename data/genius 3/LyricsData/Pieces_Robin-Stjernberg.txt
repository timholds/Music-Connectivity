We pick up the pieces that are left of us to find
Yeah we might not see them but we'll reach them if we try
Losing our ground but we're keeping our hearts holding the line
I guess I'm still broken but with you I will be fine
With you I will be fine
We're moving on and on and on and face the day
And we're growing stronger not afraid what's in our way
Now they think we've lost it they think we're gone
But we're gonna prove they all are wrong
We're moving on and on and on
And seize the day
You stopped me from shaking when you found me in the rain
Making me feel alive you took away the pain
Now we're facing tomorrow don't look back on yesterday
Back on yesterday
We're moving on and on and on and face the day
And we're growing stronger not afraid what's in our way
Now they think we've lost it they think we're gone
But we're gonna prove they all are wrong
We're moving on and on and on
And seize the day
No matter what's in our way
No matter what's in our way
We're moving on and on and on and face the day
And we're growing stronger not afraid what's in our way
Now they think we've lost it they think we're gone
But we're gonna prove they all are wrong
We're moving on and on and on and face the day
And we're growing stronger not afraid what's in our way
We pick up the pieces that are left of us to find
