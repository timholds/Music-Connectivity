[Verse 1: Claas]
Yeah, these mother fuckers still talking
Staring at a bunch of dead men walking
The commotion, it keeps my brain numb
But I'm about to just snap and then go dumb
Here we go turn the lights off
Cause y'all don't really want to see me when the mic drops
And when the rhyme stop, and when the fight starts
Bitch I'm a big bear, with a lion heart
Fuck them all if they hate me
Cause I don't give a fuck about them Imma brush them off, Jay Z
I'm a little bit crazy
But at the same time people always tell me I'm amazing
That's all I'll ever be, and I love it
Mother fuckers begging please they can shove it
Hah, I'm not above it, my mind has gone nuts
I'm Lil Jon now nigga I don't give a fuck

[Hook: Kasland]
People all talk, but it's all the same
They think they know me cause they know my name
Half the shit they say drives me so insane
Imma snap one day and you're all to blame
Now pause the game, buy some ecs
Start sipping on a 40 while you drive and text
All insanity, profanity, the lies are next
I'm just mentally insane and these are side effects

[Verse 2: Kasland]
When the screws get loose and I lose it who's
Going to be there to stop what these illusions do
I'm elusive too while I'm cruising through
Every track that I do with a noose and two
Different voices in my head could be caused by the sleep aids
Filled with medication got me gone in a deep phase
Wake up in the mornings by the toilet with the seat raised
(Are you crazy?) Only on the week days
Hah, and I never thought about it
But I shout at everybody then my angers automatic
Like I barely get upset and I just lose control
Stop asking me to change before I lose it oh
And you don't want to run up into someone in the place so
Well equipped with hellish shit and mentally erased no
Body ever saw me til I caught up with the pace though
Now you want to say that you're a fan if you say so

[Hook: Kasland]

[Verse 3: Lil Tin]
Yeah I'm crazy, don't fuck with me
Tired of dealing with these hoes
Fucking sick of y'all bugging me
Before these side effects explode (go and get it mother fucker)
Tell me why you stupid bitches got to ask when I pass
Why can't Lil Tin just holler back, God, he's mad
Now I'm mad, I'm just barely sticking it out
Instead of my name we'll put my dick in your mouth
Say fuck you, fuck you, fuck you all
Oh this shit's a fucking game, what you busting my balls
Man this ain't the fucking card that you're wanting to draw
You're the reason why I cuss so fucking much in this song
I said now I'm getting really pissed off, add my withdraws
Anger's about to lift off, peaking to the tip top
Get off, I'm jumping like a tip off
Sick of all this shit, middle finger's up for lift off

[Hook: Kasland]
