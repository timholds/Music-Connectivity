She's so lucky that she had to suffer some
Left her happy home began to drink and slum
She's got problems?
C'mon name me one?
She makes problems
Like makin' new friends

She had to suffer some
Be like everyone
Had to suffer some
She gets in free down at the scream
Oh yeah

All night running through her living room
All her sucked up her friends and daughter too
You poor mother! You cashed your little one in
For a three bag fill up and a new syringe

She had to suffer some
Be like everyone
Had to suffer some
Was in the pink now she's in the blue
Oh yeah

And you know
She's seen better days
Did you hear?
How far she's gone?
Far away
Far away
She's gone far away

May be the last song you'll be sung
Ain't no sweet left in that emotion
She's got problems
And more problems to come
'cause it's worse than murder
That's what you done
Now you go suffer!

Yeah she had to suffer some
Be like every one
Had to suffer some
Was in the pink baby's feeling blue?
Yeah she had to suffer some
Be like every one
Had to suffer some
She gets in free
Always was a freak
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
