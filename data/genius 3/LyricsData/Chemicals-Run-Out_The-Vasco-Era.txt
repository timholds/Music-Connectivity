I can hold myself
Maybe I can hold myself
Maybe I can hold myself
Maybe I can hold myself
Yeah I have suffered from
Delusions of significance but
Sister I am no longer there
Go looking for the
Sickness that was in me
Cause that's all you will find back there baby
You'll find it in spades otherwise I'm gone
I can hold myself
Maybe I can hold myself
Maybe I can hold myself
Maybe I can hold myself
I hear clocks ticking
Reminds me of us
Always overtaken by much stronger things
But unable to stop until the chemicals have run out
I was born here but I won't die here baby
You'll find it in spades otherwise I
I hope to find them, but instead
In a silhouette
I find heart crane's head
On the clouds above
Above the west gate bridge again
