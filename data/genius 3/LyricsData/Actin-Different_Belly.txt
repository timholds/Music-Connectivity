[Verse 1]
I say I'm goin' ham but it's against my religion
Came in this bitch, never ask for permission, uh
Mix it, sip it, drink it, try to think it over and you'll prolly overthink it, uh
Am I trippin', sh, listen, sh grown men talkin' like bitches
These days I can barely even tell the difference
Hate in their blood like a motherfuckin' sickness
Wet pussy drippin', got 'em all slippin'
And you wanna act livid cause we all livin'
There's enough to go around, we can all get it
And they say small world, I say large prison
I'm a savage I've been actin' vicious
All this money got me actin' different
I just need a pack of bad bitches, that'll blast for me like they sacrilegious

[Hook]
Lately I'ma savage I've been actin' vicious
They say this money got me actin' different
They say this money got me actin' different
They say this money got me actin' different
I fell in love with this shit, got myself addicted
You can't complain about the pain, when it's self inflicted
I'm talking jealous friends, these selfish bitches
They say this money got me actin' different
Oh Lord

[Verse 2]
You must be from Hell for Heaven's sake
She make holy water evaporate
I might eat the pussy for half a date
Revenge got a better aftertaste
24/7 my mama pray
12 never ever cracked a case
I'm crackin' cases to celebrate
Money is all I will ever chase
Talking birds, ooou you say that you selling weight
You know we call that shit feather weight
I snap on everything Velous made
Opportunity knock, I answer the door in my robe and my socks
She take some shoes for the pussy
You sell your soul for the box

[Hook]
Lately I'ma savage I've been actin' viscous
They say this money got me actin' different
They say this money got me actin' different
They say this money got me actin' different
I fell in love with this shit, got myself addicted
You can't complain about the pain, when it's self inflicted
I'm talking jealous friends, these selfish bitches
They say this money got me actin' different
Oh Lord
