She stands there looking at me
I know she's wonderin'
If she should kick it with me
Cuz you all got that somethin'
If she be wanting to freak
The shakin' thunderin'
And now she's starting to creep up on me

Man she looks so good (Man she looks so good)
And she looks so fine (Looks so fine)
Steady takes me high
Singing 'My Oh My' (Oh my my my my)
Got to get with her (Gotta get with her)
Have her in my world (In my world)
Hold her in my arms

Run around in the rain with you
Everyday now only you

Ds:
It's getting tough in the scene
The place is jumping now
I grab her hand and proceed
To the crowd that's tumbling
I really want her with me
Some one-on-one romance
What she keeps doing to me
Got me feelin'...

Sr:
Man she looks so good (Oh~)
And she looks so fine (So fine~)
Steady takes me high

Got to get with her (Gotta get with her)
Have her in my world (In my world)
Hold her in my arms
That's forever yo
