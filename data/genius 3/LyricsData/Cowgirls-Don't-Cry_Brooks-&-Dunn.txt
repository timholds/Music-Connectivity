[Verse 1]
Her Daddy gave her first pony
Then told her to ride
She climbed high in that saddle
Fell I don't know how many times
Taught her a lesson that she learned
Maybe a little too well

[Chorus]
Cowgirls don't cry
Ride, baby, ride
Lessons in life are going to show you in time
Soon enough your going to know why
It's going to hurt every now and then
If you fall get back on again
Cowgirls don't cry

[Verse 2]
She grew up
She got married
Never was quite right
She wanted a house, a home and babies
He started coming home late at night
She didn't let him see it break her heart
She didn't let him see her fall apart

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Phone rang early one morning
Her momma's voice, she'd been crying
Said it's your daddy, you need to come home
This is it, I think he's dying
She laid the phone down by his head
The last words that he said

[Chorus]
