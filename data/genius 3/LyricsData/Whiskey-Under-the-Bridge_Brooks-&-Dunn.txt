[Verse]
There's not a heart that ain't been broken
A lie that ain't been spoken
A shattered dream that brand new love can't fix
I've been burned, I've been cheated
But this old heart's still beating
Ain't no big deal
It's just whiskey under the bridge
Let's dance a little closer
I'll help you get over
The hurt you thought you never could forget
The bitter tears you tasted
All those nights you wasted
Don't look back
It's just whiskey under the bridge

[Chorus][x2]
All those nights of drinking
Finally got me thinking
Heartache is just a waste of time
I've been burned, I've been cheated
But this old heart's still beating
Ain't no big deal
It's just whiskey under the bridge

[Outro]
Ain't no big deal
It's just whiskey under the bridge[x2]
