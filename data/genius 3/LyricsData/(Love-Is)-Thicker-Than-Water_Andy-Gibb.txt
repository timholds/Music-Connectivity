[Chorus:]
Love is higher than a mountain
Love is thicker than water
You are this dreamer's only dream
Heaven's angel, devil's daughter

[Verse 1:]
Say, my mind
Should I go with her on silent nights
She'll drive me crazy in the end
And I should leave this paradise

But I can't leave her
While I need her more
Than she needs you
That's what I'm living for

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
Say, my thought
Should I find out she don't care at all
She'll leave me crying in the end
Wandering through the afterglow

But I can't leave her
While I need her more
Than she needs you
That's what I'm praying for

[Repeat Chorus x2:]

La, la, la
La, la, la, la, la...
