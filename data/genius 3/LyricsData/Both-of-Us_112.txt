[Verse 1]
You might be the reason why
Everyone wanna be a star
(Be a star)
Everyone wanna be a star
Hoping that I meet you one day
Hoping we can take this far
(Yeah, yeah…Ohh)
You might be the reason that I
Ever wanna get some paper
Ever wanna stop them haters
Ever wanna get my weight up
You might be the reason why
You might be the reason why
Reason why I stay so fly
Pull up for you every…time
(Pull up for you every time)
You’re the reason why I get it

[Chorus]
I’m doing this for both of us
All these different shows
All these albums on this road
I’m doing it for both of us
Girl, you know I love my fans
But this job, it be demandin’, now
Doin’ what I’m doin’ ‘cuz I do it for the both of us
Use it but don’t lose it ‘cuz I do it for the both of us
Treat you like a trophy but I’m never gonna hold you up
I’m leaving but I need you I don’t ever wanna lose your touch

[Bridge]
What does it profit a man
To gain this whole world
And lose your soul mate
It’d be like check mate

[Verse 2]
You’re the reason that I shine
Like a star in the sky
I’ve got legions of the fans but
All I see is you and me
Just on this road tryin’ to get to the good life
But Lord, just don’t let it rain (Lord just don’t let it rain)
‘Cuz the money it never made me
I’d give it all away

[Chorus]
I’m doing this for both of us
All these different shows
All these albums on this road
I’m doing it for both of us
Girl, you know I love my fans
But this job, it be demandin’
Doin’ what I’m doin’ ‘cuz I do it for the both of us
Confusing but don’t lose it ‘cuz I do it for the both of us
Treat you like a trophy but I’m never gonna hold you up
I’m leaving but I need you I don’t ever wanna lose your touch

[Breakdown]
Never wanna lose your
Your sweet love
I can’t see it no more
(As soon as I get home)
As soon as I get home
I’m turning off this phone
And I’m making my way home

[Chorus]
I’m doing this for both of us
All these different shows
All these albums on this road
I’m doing it for both of us
Girl, you know I love my fans
But this job, it be demandin’
I’m doing this for both of us
All these different shows
All these albums on this road
I’m doing it for both of us
Girl, you know I love my fans
But this job, it be demandin’
Doin’ what I’m doin’ ‘cuz I do it for the both of us
Confusing but don’t lose it ‘cuz I do it for the both of us
Treat you like a trophy but I’m never gonna hold you up
I’m leaving but I need you I don’t ever wanna lose your touch
