Captain's hair
Shone softly in the sun
Rode on his best mare
To Sarah

Schoolboy eyes
Would stare in innocent fun
Never told no lies
He loved Sarah

Whispered by a bramble
Carried by a brook
To every fishers hook
"Sarah"

Fragrant fields
Playing croquet in the sun
Nothing appeals
Like Sarah

Whispered by a bramble
Carried by a brook
To every fishers hook
"Sarah"
