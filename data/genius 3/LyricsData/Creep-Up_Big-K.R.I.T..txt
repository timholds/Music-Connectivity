[Verse 1]
I hit them with the sub, watch them buckle under pressure
Too many hoes hate cause I got gold on my dresser
Too many nigga watching, praying I might fall quick
Same nigga was in my face last year and that's some flaw shit
Lords knows I've been dying, so this year I can't give up
Creeping like caterpillar, shoes and belts made of lizard
Tweeters, speakers, and kickers
Flow colder than blizzard
Shine brighter than nova, so mother fuck your flicker
I play to the grizzle, that's the bone for you city folk
Give it all I got, pushing chrome with a city ho
Putting on my friends and my kin, hollerin' Multi!
Rep it til the end we gonna win til the sun die
Tell them haters that, now tell them haters this
Instead of jocking mine, go get your own shit
I battle through the buzzard and the cluckers on that fuck shit
Now I'm riding clean and my team ain't nothing to fuck with
A player told me...

[Verse 2]
Now I ain't no chump, I'm known for flowing proper
She bopped off my top you blocked and tried to stop her
Yall flex don't even fakes with chrome and candy paint
You thought that shit could float on it's own but that shit sank
Mister sucka ducket, If you lucky she'll let you finger fuck it
You cuff or buss it, I stretch that pussy like Kangol buckets
Your game too rusty, my game was polished to play a primp
Not even them gators or suits to tailor could save a simp
From a flame spitter, lame nigga
Never had a chance
Break his bitch and the bitch that came with her
And ride off like a thief in the night
Ain't no sense in doing shit if you ain't dying to do it right
What's the word ho?! I got it jumping like a six four
Truck shaking like a nympho
I had to be a king in my past life
Cause I got a crown and my mothafuckin' cash right
A player told me...
