Rock the mic!
East
Circle

(Take one)
[Choc] Choclair says do what you like
(Take two)
[RoDo] Ro Dolla here to rock the mic
(Take three)
[Sauk] Saukrates most casually
I feed your energy, say it
(Tell em that's it's alright)

[Saukrates]
We represnting the T.O
Gritty, city lights from the East Coast
Niggas be on the grind 'til we bleed toast
Hot money, funny how the weed goes
Out the nose, 'til we Rosco Pecko training hoes
Sneak a peek through the peep whole
Scarborough swingin', swimming in fish like eco
Where'd the weed go?
Give me the blunt back my man

[Choclair]
I'm cruising eastside ot the T.O
Me, Impala, Sox in the Volvo, C-7-0
Dolla, Ro, shotgun hands steady on the doe-doe
Cadillac style, big balls swinging
Rooftop bar-B-Q, ten pound chicken
[Ro Dolla]
Head down to Hill Top to meet Winnie who be clipping
At the shop that keeps me looking so fresh so clean
Can't forget Block Thirteen
Home of the "Doctor"
Twin Rivers thinking bout life so much
Pop my clutch, catch the groove, just too smooth
Basket case, giving you a taste

CHORUS (all) [Saukrates] {Choclair}
(Tell em that it's alright)
The East all up in your face
(Tell em that it's alright)
{If you're squeezed tell 'em give you space}
(Tell em that it's alright)

[Solitair]
From the old to the new, we keep giving it to you
Circle (ha) I thought you knew, nigga, don't front
If you want go ahead, let em know I said to
(Tell em that it's alright)
Tell em that it's alright
(Tell em that it's alright)
I said to tell em that it's alright
(Tell em that it's alright) x3

[Choclair]
Buffer's park, after dark
Is where I did my thang
Latex out the window when I'm done my thang
Head to Johnny's on a late night stroll
Back to the crib, feet kicked up with a grips on the Schlitz
A new year turned my Schlitz straight to a spliff
My eyes stay glazed all day
My food for thought, it holds weight
And now worldwide for ten G's a plate
So fuck what you want me to say, it's Scarborough kids

[Saukrates]
So wobble it, I follow it
Her ass built like hard doe bread
Get your Benz repossessd by Auto Feds
Auto Feds really stand for Scarborough kids
They'll steal your shit, for ornaments
Hang 'em on a Christmas tree in August
My promise is, heavier than Harpo tits
I mark those kids with heart conditions
(Pump)

[Ro Dolla]
Ro Ro Deez, yeah the East on a mission (pump)
We hold it down for our homies in prison (I said pump)
My words shine, stop, look, listen
Could give a fuck where you came from
High-rise or slum, Ray 'n' Nef W
Bringing trouble to who, try and step in my shoes
Dog, I'm worth like ten Mill'
West Hill, a spot where you got to chill
Hatin' on the Circle Fam still
(Tell em that it's alright)
Ladies in the East what the deal?
(Tell em that it's alright)
[Choc] If you late paying on your bills
(Tell em that it's alright)
[Sauk] Tell em that it's alright
(Tell em that it's alright)
(Take one)
[Choc] Chocleeze off the Heeze
(Take two)
[Sauk] Saukrates be getting the freeplay
(Take three)
[RoDo] Ro Deeze chop your girl easy, morning of a weekday
(Tell em that it's alright) x4

[Solitair]
From the old to the new, we keep giving it to you
Circle (ha) I thought you knew, nigga, don't front
If you want go ahead, let em know I said to
(Tell em that it's alright)
I said to tell em that it's alright
(Tell em that it's alright)
Go ahead and tell em that it's alright
(Tell em that it's alright) x6
