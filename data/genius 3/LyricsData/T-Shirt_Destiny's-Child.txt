[Spoken: Beyoncé]
Hey baby
I wish you could see what I have on right now
You so sexy
Imagine how intense it would be to hold me right now
Our song's playing

[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
At night, when you're far and I'm alone
I feel the fabric from your t-shirt flow with my body
I can still hear your baritone in my ear
Telling me you'll take it slow
And I was in the mirror playing a role
Like you were here, I couldn't turn me on
So I fell asleep with the music on
Woke up again hearing the same old song playing

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly]
Give it to me deeper
Giving me the fever
Now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing
Oh, we tried to stand up
Hold me while my hands up
And the music kicks off
Fantasies were shook up
I’m thinking to myself again

[Chorus]
When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Outside I hear the rain on my window pane
Hold up a minute, thought I heard your name
My mind, playing tricks on me again
I hear knocks at the door, is that my baby home?
Why couldn't it be reality?
Looked at the clock and it says 4:03
At nine, he’ll be arriving on a plane
Then we'll be making love and hearing the song again

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly]
Give it to me deeper
You're giving me the fever
Now you got my feet up
This one is a keeper
Now the second verse is playing
Oh, we tried to stand up
Hold me while my hands up
And the music kicks off
Fantasies with shirts off
I’m thinking to myself again

[Chorus]
When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne

[Bridge: Michelle]
Ooh, boy I’ve been waiting
Got my body shaking
You're so deep, baby please, take it easy
I look at your face and
Got my heart racing
You're so deep, baby please, take it easy

[Spoken: Beyoncé]
Keep it right there
Oh wait, wait…
Yeah, keep it right there
You driving me crazy

[Chorus]
When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I wish you were here (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
When I need your feel (I sleep in your t-shirt)
I need your help (to take off your t-shirt)
After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
Wake up in your t-shirt
Still smell the scent of your cologne
