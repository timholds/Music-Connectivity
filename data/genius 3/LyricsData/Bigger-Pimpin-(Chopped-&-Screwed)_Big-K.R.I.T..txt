[Hook:]
Bigger pimpin' they know me
Killa K that OG
Give respect that they owe me
Give respect that they owe me
Bigger pimpin' they know me
Killa K that OG
Give respect that they owe me
Fuck niggas can't hold me

[Verse 1:]
Sitting low in my seat drop it's top down it's summer cuh
Never falling off, all day for ballin', my flow stay magnificent
Know the K got flow for days, I raise the bar, and I'm stabbin'
Motivated by all these haters, so celebrate my action
Bigger pimpin' while I diminish all terrorists and competition
That (?) with me going gold, set a plan, I'm making millions
How I learned means how I'm livin', so I be tellin' her till I'm gone
In a Jag with a yellow throne and a yellow bone (?) on
DVD's in my dash, pimpin', 24 with that glass in it
Stretch my paper like rubberbands, my nickname's elastic
Battle me in that 8-Mile, I'm similar to that rabbit
Track poppin', my (?), you just got your ass kicked
Be amused by trappin' nigga, either way I'm slabbin' nigga
Shine out, shine later, either way I'm makin' paper
Close mouth, don't get fed, that's why I hit the block
Twistin' corners and breakin' laws, paper chasin' and wreckin' shop

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Second round, it's going down, I go hard in the paint boy
Hate me and my (?) boy
Second round, it's going down, I go hard in the paint boy
Hate me and my (?) boy
Sittin' pretty where I wanna be, I'm the first pick of this industry
Whole team, going hard, write tracks and making beats
Clear as day, I gotta grind and gotta shine to get on
Oh shit you might (?), Oh shit you might (?)
Lay it down all on the table
I'm spittin' facts, they tellin' fable
Moral of day kids? Don't believe that fake shit
Wanna learn? no problem cuz, I'd gladly be they teacher
Showin' out, you leanin' like the tower of Pisa
Either respect my grind or keep your ass on the sideline
Everytime you seein' me, you slowin' up like caution sign
Often I'm labeled the best
North, South, East, and the West
(?) with K, do a show?
See a 10, nothin' less
