[Verse 1]
Yes, she blew through the door like TNT
Put her hand on her hip, pointed a finger at me
Said: "I'm a whiskey drinking, cowboy chasing, helluva time
"I like Kenny, Keith, Allan and Patsy Cline
"I'm a full grown Queen Bee looking for honey
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."
Yeah, the band took a break
The DJ played P Diddy
She said: "I didn't come here to hear
"Something thumping from the city."
Said: "I, I shaved my legs, I paid my money
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."

[Chorus]
Crank up the band, play the steel guitar
Hank it up a little, let's rock this bar
Threw back a shot; yelled: "I'm a George Strait junkie
"Ha-ooh-hoo, play something country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, aw, play something country."

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the bartender yelled: "Y'all, it's closing time."
She got this wild look on her face
An' said: "Your truck or mine
"I know a place down the road
"It's kinda funky
"Ha-ooh-hoo, all out in the country
"Ha-ooh-hoo, now, play something country."

[Chorus][x2]
