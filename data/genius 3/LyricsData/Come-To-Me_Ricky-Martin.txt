This is not the way I wanted things to be
I hope someday you'll understand
My heart beats stronger when I know I'm close to you
Its helped me be a better man

Why must all of the love come falling
Why don't we just take our chance
I could walk this road again with you
My love....oh,oh

Why can't you come to me
Don't save your love for some
Elusive dream
Why can't you find your way
I will fall for you no matter where
It leads

This is not the way we started you and I
How was it that I lost my way
Two souls can drift apart
Without a word
Were those the words I did not say

Why must all of the dreams
Come falling
Why don't we just take our chance
I could walk this road again with you
My love...oh, oh

Why can't you come to me
Don't save your love for some
Elusive dream
Why can't you find your way
I will fall for you no matter where
It leads

I would walk this road again with you my love

Why can't you come to me
Don't save your love for some
Elusive dream
Why can't you find your way
I will fall for you no matter where
It leads
