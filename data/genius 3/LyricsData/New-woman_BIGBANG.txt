She´s got the sweetest dispositions
Warmth and compassion in her eyes
She would make a loving mom we´d always be on time
She knows how to make me relax when I get tense
I also think she´s got good fashion taste
When we go somewhere the men and the women stare
Nothing´s wrong with my new woman
But something is wrong with me
When we listen to the music
I don´t know what to feel
She never leaves this world
Got no reason to
She never made me write this song
Because this song is about you
She´s got a fine education
And good friends that could help me get started too
She takes good care of herself
She´ll do anything for me
She gets a lot of attention
She could be a lot of fun
And whereas I bring the gloom
She´ll mesmerize the room
Cause nothing´s wrong with my new woman
But something is wrong with me
When we listen to the music
I don´t know what to feel
She never leaves this world
Got no reason to
She never made me write this song
Because this song is about you
My new woman I apologize
I´m just so full of old bad love
Never going to die
Well they can call me a liar
I´m just a leaf in the wildfire
Around you
