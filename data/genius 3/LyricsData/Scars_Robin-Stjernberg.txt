Everybody suffers days of doubt
Mmm
This when you let all your deem inside
Ohno
When your confidence is torn to pieces
Conversations in your mind
Telling you that you’re the ugly one
Ohno
Are you strong enough to rise up when you fall
Have you hurt enough when you’re scarred from it all
Never forget to let your fire shine
Deep in your heart you know you’ll find
That you’re strong enough to go far
Carrying the scars
Sometimes breaking up’s like breaking down
Hey yeah
It leaves you crying, laying on the ground
And the things that people say to hurt you
They can cut you down inside
But know that ugly is what ugly does
Are you strong enough to rise up when you fall
Have you hurt enough when you’re scarred from it all
Never forget to let your fire shine
Deep in your heart you know you’ll find
That you’re strong enough to go far
Carrying the scars
People always trying hard
Trying to hide away just who they are
Doesn’t matter now, the words they say
All the scars are gonna fade away
You are strong enough to survive what you feel
But it scars enough that it takes time to heal
Are you strong
I am strong
I am strong
Are you strong enough to rise up when you fall
Have you hurt enough when you’re scarred from it all
Never forget to let your fire shine
Deep in your heart you know you’ll find
That you’re strong enough to go far
Carrying the scars
