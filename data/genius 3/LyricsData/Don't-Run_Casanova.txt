[Pre-Chorus]
Niggas tryna catch me in a drop
Niggas tryna book me for my watch
They ain't know I had the Glock
Now everybody getting shot
Boom, boom, boom
Niggas tryna catch me in a drop
Niggas tryna book me for my watch
They ain't know I had the Glock
Now everybody getting shot
Boom, boom, boom

[Chorus]
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
They ain't know I had the gun
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
They ain't know I had the gun

[Verse 1]
You know where the Nets play
Out in Brooklyn shootin' niggas in broad day
Runnin' off on the plug, nigga that's no way
Out in Brooklyn, gettin' brick from the oyay
It's two times, comma that
Brooklyn bring that money back
Tried to catch me slippin' Lust
Left with a hunnid pack
Shooters like a quarterback
Money long, I ordered that
You should never thought of that
Now you can't get your daughter back

[Pre-Chorus]
Niggas tryna catch me in a drop
Niggas tryna book me for my watch
They ain't know I had the Glock
Now everybody getting shot
Boom, boom, boom
Niggas tryna catch me in a drop
Niggas tryna book me for my watch
They ain't know I had the Glock
Now everybody getting shot
Boom, boom, boom

[Chorus]
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
They ain't know I had the gun
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
They ain't know I had the gun

[Verse 2]
No good morning, it's get money, you know what's up
Big timer, headliner, my money up
I see them watchin', I see them plottin'
Just come and get me
Lord my witness, this 40'll knock him off his pivot
Man down, swiper came to take his life
Paid down, rent a shooter somethin' light
I be movin' militant, I don't fuck with many men
Gettin' to the mula, ya I know that shit be killin' 'em

[Pre-Chorus]
Niggas tryna catch me in a drop
Niggas tryna book me for my watch
They ain't know I had the Glock
Now everybody getting shot
Boom, boom, boom
Niggas tryna catch me in a drop
Niggas tryna book me for my watch
They ain't know I had the Glock
Now everybody getting shot
Boom, boom, boom

[Chorus]
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
They ain't know I had the gun
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
Fuck boy don't run
They ain't know I had the gun
