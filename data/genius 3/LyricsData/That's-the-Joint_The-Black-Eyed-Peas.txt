[Intro]
That's the joint...
That's the joint {*6X*}
That's the jam
Play it again

[Verse One]
I like the way the rhythm makes me jump and move
It gots a feelin that makes me wanna do my do
Got me feelin joy, turn my grey sky blue
And when you hear a cut baby doll I know you
Will feel it huh? Get up on the floor start movi' some
Body parts that got brothers actin dumb
And they be actin dumb-D-D-D-D-D-D-DDDDDDDD-DUMB
And they be actin dumb from the cut that's playin
People break they neck from this demonstration
We about mass appeal, no segregation
Got black to asian, and caucausian

[Hook: repeat 2X]
That's the joint... that's the joint...
That's the jam... play it again...

[Verse Two]
Let your body collide to the rhythm provided
By the mind state affairs, classified to make y'all
Heat up and flare, I swear
I serenade the soul and, so beware
And what's happenin here, seek one to help you
Feelin a piece of mind, let your spine unwind
Maybe in time we can stop this crime
But until then, yo I'ma rock a rhyme sayin

[Hook]

That's the joint {*8X*}

[Verse Three]
Got some streets appeal with the junk's that real
I don't need no steel to make my point
Get down and dirty cause that's my joint
Ha! Ha! Ha! That's my joint
Ha! Ha! Ha! That's my joint
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha that's my joint
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha that's my joint
We preferably, make our point
Through a nation we build, off the musical field
Or a visual thrill, we do what we feel
Any time or place, on stage in your face
Orbiting in Earth, and outer space

[Verse Four]
We rock that {*shuh*} we flip that {*shuh*}
Some East coast, West coast, cosmic {*uh*}
Some Borthbound {*shuh*} some some Southbound {*shuh*}
Some overseas London out of town {*uh*}
Rockin the joint, rockin the jams

[record slows down]
Turn that shit up, play it again
Cause that's the joint, that's the jam
Turn that shit...

[Hook]

That's the joint

{*instrumental to end, then record slows to a stop*}
