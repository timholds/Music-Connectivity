My moneyponny
Took all the money
Never touched my heart, but torned me apart
Lord, i dont know really where i belong
But i
Want you to ease my troubled mind
Know that you gotta leave right on time
If you could understand
I think you could be my right hand

My moneyponny
Boy am i running
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee
And leave me hanging in the apple tree, singing

Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee

Hey hey!
Dont pull the trigger
Get someone bigger
Dont touch my heart, torn me apart
Lord, i dont really know if i belong at all but i

Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee

You got me hanging like a man boy, in the apple tree
I got the sound
I got the feeling
I got the, swet
And i need a job!
So come on
Want you to ease my troubled mind
Know, that you gotta leave right on time
If you can understand
I say, you could be my right hand

Woohoo!

Singing!
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee

Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee
Fly like a butterfly, sting like a bee
