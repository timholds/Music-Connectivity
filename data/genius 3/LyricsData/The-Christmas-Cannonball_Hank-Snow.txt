From up the frozen northland, to the bitter covered clime
Theres a train that comes a rollin' every year at Christmas time
All the kids are in their glory, when the snow begins to fall
Cause they know its bringin' Santa Clause and the Christmas Cannonball

It takes from the North Pole, with a jingle and a roar
Its partly run by reindeer, till it gets to Baltimore
If you hear the cry of timber coming out of Montreal
You can start to look for Santa Clause and the Christmas Cannonball

Its loaded down with nice things
From a doll to fancy toys
And its bringing all the presents
To the good little girls and boys
So listen to your mothers
Do the things she wants you to
If you can't be good till christmas
Then its just too bad for you
Take it easy with your cryin'
And be careful one and all
Cause its almost time for Santa Claus
And the Christmas Cannonball
