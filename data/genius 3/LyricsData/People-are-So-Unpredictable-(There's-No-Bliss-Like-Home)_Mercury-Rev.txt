Opened up by a stranger
At an uncertain hour
You opened yourself
Like a curious flower
Opens herself
Wide to the moon

Life is uncertain and people are so...
Unpredictable
Unshielded by booze people are so...
Unpredictable

One moon, and one you, one chance to kiss you
One moon, and one you, I've one chance to kiss you
One moon, one you... and one chance to kiss you

There's no bliss like home
There's no bliss like home
There's no bliss like home
