[Verse 1]
I forget where I'm going in my own house
I got myself in this, I'll get myself out
I talk out loud, at the top of my voice I sing
Whoa keep the faith, see what tomorrow brings

[Chorus]
I can't get over you
Try as I may oh it no use
My heart just can't leave you alone
My mind won't believe you're gone
I can't get over you

[Verse 2]
I got a front row seat here to a fool's masquerade
And that fool in the mirror keeps saying I'm doing OK
I stare at that door that you walked out
It hits me hard and leaves no doubt

[Chorus][x2]
