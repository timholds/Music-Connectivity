[Chorus]
Get money, don’t be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss
Get back up if you fall, and when yo' number called
You better give yo' all
I hope you give yo' all
You gotta play until the end
The only diff' between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

[Verse 1]
Ain't nothing for free so get yo' ass up
My partner scared if we don’t speed then they might pass us
So we hit 85, tryna keep this dream alive
All I see is green, I think these screens is fucking with my sight
Nowadays hoes claiming that they crushin'
Bop a darling in my bucket 'til their heads catch concussions
But please don’t push my buttons, I don’t know you like that
Can't do no favors for these haters, I don’t owe you like that
Well, I guess it’s the allure like when you need to score
One second on the clock and the shot's all yours
Hit or miss, we take the risk
Cause anything is better than Viennas and warm grits
Trading bust-it-babies for fly divas that buck
Her only concern is if my car match her clutch
Yeah, she's a gold digger but that pussy good
So what the fuck, don’t be late for this player's ball
Hurry up and...

[Chorus]
Get money, don’t be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss
Get back up if you fall, and when yo' number called
You better give yo' all
I hope you give yo' all
You gotta play until the end
The only diff' between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins

[Verse 2]
They told me life is what you make it
So what you been creating on your free time?
I’ll lend you bars if you need rhyme or reason
Some people change, it’s a part of life like seasons
Just be aware that everybody ain't your friend
They’ll be gone with the wind once your jump shot don’t go in
Or your ACL torn and you're a couple yards short
From a Super Bowl Championship and it was down four
Gotta play the field, be willing to ride, willing to dive
For what you desire, call your pop fly, but never collide
With other players that play the game
Don’t be eager to run with crowds, stay in your lane
Pass this knowledge on to your team, but carry the flame
Cause it's yours and yours alone to brighten your way
Put God first and free your soul
Cause even Olympic runners sometimes lose their gold
So...

[Chorus]
Get money, don’t be no lame
Bench warmers never ride foreign so play the game
Never drop the ball, never accept a loss
Get back up if you fall, and when yo' number called
You better give yo' all
I hope you give yo' all
You gotta play until the end
The only diff' between a winner and a loser is a winner plays until he wins
