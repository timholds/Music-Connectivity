[Verse 1]You got me turned on, upside down, you got me looking in the mirror, seeing brand new things
You got me racing in my mind, tossing, turning, yearning for you, when I fall asleep

[Hook]Is it a great expectation? Am I falling away from me?
You give me human fixation, will you be more than just a memory?

[Pre-Chorus]Am I making it up?
Falling in love or wasting my time?
You were shaking me up, giving me love
Are you just in my mind?
Am I making it up?
Falling in love or wasting my time?
You were shaking me up, giving me love
Are you just in my mind?

[Chorus]Just in my mind
Just in my mind
Just in my mind
Just in my mind

[Verse 2]Each time I hear you saying my name, I feel my body going under, do you feel the same?
Every time I see your face, you make me wonder, am I rushing, do you do the same?

[Hook]Is it a great expectation? Am I falling away from me?
You give me human fixation, will you be more than just a memory?

[Pre-Chorus]Am I making it up?
Falling in love or wasting my time?
You were shaking me up, giving me love
Are you just in my mind?
Am I making it up?
Falling in love or wasting my time?
You were shaking me up, giving me love
Are you just in my mind?

[Chorus]Just in my mind
Just in my mind
Just in my mind
Just in my mind

[Verse 3]Every time I see your face
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Do you feel the same?
Or is it just in my, just in my mind?

[Pre-Chorus]Am I making it up?
Falling in love or wasting my time?
You were shaking me up, giving me love
Are you just in my mind?
Am I making it up?
Falling in love or wasting my time?
You were shaking me up, giving me love
Are you just in my mind?

[Chorus]Just in my mind (x8)
