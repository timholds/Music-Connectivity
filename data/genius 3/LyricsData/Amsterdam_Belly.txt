Might end up dying at LIV
That’s like going to heaven
Then we hit 11 until the clock hit 11
Might end up dying at LIV
That’s like going to heaven
Then we hit 11 until the clock hit 11

[Verse 1]
I’m talking hundreds of bands
Money all in the palm of my hand
I did it all for the fam
I really hope god understands
I be back in a month
Stacking up packs in the back of the trunk
Acura strapped from the back to the front
Paper bags but we ain’t packing lunch
Three eighty but the shit pack a punch
I hit you and see what you had over brunch
Strapped like I’m Rambo, bitch I’m too fast for the Lambo
Back in the bando, birds like I’m trapping from Nando's
I can’t get no higher man
Preach to the choir man
She slide down the pole like a fireman
Put this vitamin D in your diet plan
Put this vitamin D in your diet plan
Put this vitamin D in your diet plan

[Hook]
I get my kush from Afghanistan
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
I get my kush from Afghanistan
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
I get my kush from Afghanistan
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
I get my kush from Afghanistan
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
Tonight I might leave in an ambulance
I love when she call me the candy man
Cocaina by the avalanche
Plug riding in the caravan
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
Shipment from Amsterdam
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
Shipment from Amsterdam

[Bridge]
Might end up dying at LIV
That’s like going to heaven
Then we hit 11 until the clock hit 11
Might end up dying LIV
That’s like going to heaven
Then we hit 11 until the clock hit 11

[Verse 2]
Savage killer, half man half gorilla
Flipping chickens raw, salmonella
Spanish villa, windows floor to ceiling
Just so I can get that Florida feeling
Pills from Switzerland
Blue and yellow like Michigan
Send the bitches in
Hit once, she won’t see this dick again
Paid back, the wait is over
Remember way back, 88 Corolla
Now it’s Maybach like April’s over
Maybach like April’s over

[Hook]
I get my kush from Afghanistan
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
I get my kush from Afghanistan
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
I get my kush from Afghanistan
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
I get my kush from Afghanistan
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
Tonight I might leave in an ambulance
I love when she call me the candy man
Cocaina by the avalanche
Plug riding in the caravan
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
Shipment from Amsterdam
Just got a shipment from Amsterdam
Shipment from Amsterdam
