[Verse 1]
I've been so
Caught up in the thought of me and you
Even though I love
Someone else I know my heart belongs to you
Tell me, how did we ever let the situation get this far?
Maybe we should just try to hide the things we feel inside
Things I know we can't deny

[Chorus]
Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go

[Verse 2]
What did I
Do the day I let you slip into my soul
It was then, when I
Realized that I would always want you in my life
No one else can know
Of the things that we've been saying on the telephone
It would be so bad
If they ever knew that me and you were secretly into each other

[Chorus]
Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go

[Bridge]
I'm so scared, trembling inside
Cause I'm feeling like somebody else already knows
Oh my God, I love you both so much
And to have to choose between the two
Is hurting me so deep inside

[Chorus]
Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go
Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go
