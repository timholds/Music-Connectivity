[Verse 1]
She said, "Out with the boys don't cut it no more"
And I'm sorry's just noise, she's heard it all before
Said that ring on her finger, well it feels like prison
She's talked 'til she's blue, and I don't listen

[Chorus]
I went too far this time
Crossed over that line
I'm past the point of no return
Livin' proof some fools never learn
Well I pushed my luck
Now she's givin' up
Somethin' tells me
I went too far this time

[Verse 2]
She said, "Save your breath boy, I've heard it all"
And, "Keep your place there with your back to the wall"
Said, "I'm leavin' you lonely, 'cause I've had my share"
"Save those worn out 'I love you's' for someone that cares"

[Chorus]
I went too far this time
Crossed over that line
I'm past the point of no return
Livin' proof some fools never learn
Well I pushed my luck
Now she's givin' up
Oh, somethin' tells me
I went too far this time

[Bridge]
Well I pushed my luck
Now she's givin' up
Oh, something tells me
I went too far this time

[Outro]
Oh, somethin' tells me
I went too far this time
