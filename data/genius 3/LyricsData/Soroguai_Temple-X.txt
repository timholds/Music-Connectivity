Taken by surprise
Meet the king of flies
Someday

Bruises never burn
Single no return
Somehow

The dancing samurai
Electric soroguai
Restless

Hated gloryfied
Twisted paradise
Completes his grace

Chasin' the voice
Pullin' the strings
Silent moves the clown into the dark
Facin' his love
Held by his wings
Lost and found for all time in your heart

Taken by surprise
Met the king of flies
Today

Hated gloryfied
Twisted paradise
Completes his grace

Chasin' the voice
Tellin' me nothing
Even though i forget about something
Friendship above
Physical nothing
Never forget your spiritual something

Chasin' the voice
Tellin' me nothing
Even though i forget about something
Friendship above
Physical nothing
Never forget about

The dancing samurai
Electric soroguai

Chasin' the voice
Tellin' me nothing
Even though i forget about something
Friendship above
Physical nothing
Silent walks the clown into the dark
