[Intro]
Dun dun du du du du dun unh
La da da da da daa
Listen

[Verse 1]
You know I've had my share of ups and downs
You live and learn, this world keeps on turning round
Sometimes those rainy days
Seem like they last forever
Wish I could turn the page
And move on (and move on)
Been longing for the days we used to sit here talking
(All through the night)
Trynna keep my spirits high
So I can walk in (into your life)
Used to be right next to me
All the things you dream about when you're a teen
Now it seems like everything's so far away
Then one day you know

[Chorus]
I heard a word
Saying, Girl you'll be fine
I heard a word
That would ease my troubled mind
Took all the hurt away
Warmed me up inside like a summer day
So glad you said you'd never break your promises
I thank you Lord
I thank you now

[Verse 2]
Cause everybody needs (needs)
Somebody stand by their side
You look at the road
It's get rough
Still you say to yourself
Gotta drive
Now I'm ready for the fight
Send a little help; let your angels fly, (fly)
Heard the words deep down inside
I will survive
I'm stronger cause I

[Chorus]
I heard a word
Saying, Girl you'll be fine
I heard a word
That would ease my troubled mind
Took all the hurt away
Warmed me up inside like a summer day
So glad you said you'd never break your promises

[Bridge]
You promise me you'd love me (love me)
You promise me you'd bless me (blass me)
You said to me that
On you shoulder I could cry
And if I did you dry my eyes and hold me
I'm so glad that you
Took all the hurt away, (took all the hurt away)
Warmed me up inside
So glad that you never break your promises
You got me singing la la la la da oh oh oh oh oh oh
Sing la la la da da oh oh oh oh oh oh ooh ooh

You took, you took my
Took all the hurt away, (my hurt away)
Warmed me up inside (warmed me up inside like a summer day)
So glad you said you'd never break your promises. (oh oh oh ooh oh ah)

[Chorus]
I heard a word
Saying, Girl you'll be fine
I heard a word, (I heard a word)
That would ease my troubled mind
Took all the hurt away, (warmed me up inside like a summer day)
Warmed me up inside, (yes you did)
So glad, so glad, so glad, yeah, yeah ih yeah ih yeah yeah

[Outro]
I heard a word (wo ho oh aaaah)
I heard a word (I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad)
