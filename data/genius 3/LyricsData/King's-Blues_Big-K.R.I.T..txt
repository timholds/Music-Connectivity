[Hook: Big K.R.I.T. & (Erykah Badu)]
I got no time to waste
I got more bills to pay
I got more mouths to feed now, now, now
I got no time to play
I got no need to stay
When ain't no money around, round, round
What's a king without a crown?
(Time's a wastin')
What's a car without some sound?
(Don't you take your time, young man)

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Never been on that silly sucka shit
Rather ride pimped out four-doors
With the wood-grain dashboard, and a rim that sits swole
And the embroidered headrest
Yeah, that be dead fresh
In your ear like headsets
Sleepy eye, forever grind, no bed rest
I can't depend on that next check 'cause it ain't bout shit
The type of broke that got me searching through my mama's couch
For some loose change, got that dollar menu
McDouble, a small fry, lemonade and sweet tea blended
Now here it is Monday, will that get me through 'til Wednesday?
Itâ€™ll kill them hunger pains even though it ain't fulfilling
I make do with what God give me, and I take it day by day
I would come by more often, but I can't stay, 'cause...

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Try not to step on my toes
Wit' your swole bankrolls you blow and throw
On stripper pole pros you barely know, make it rain
If I was paid with no knowledge or two months late on my mortgage
In the hood that ain't safe, I'd do the same thing
But wishful thinking ain't shit without genius
I can't define how I feel, that's why I'm searching for meaning
No need to pinch me in my player suite, I know when I'm dreaming
My mama tell me 'be careful,' 'cause she know when I'm scheming
Lottery winners don't run in my family
Nor do seven dots when dice starts, so ain't no sense in me gambling
We just crap out
Maybe they'll listen to me, if I pulled the strap out
Like 'give me everything, or I'mma black out', 'cause
