Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
Don't you worry, you be strong, help you get along
Everything is gonna be alright, find someone who would treat you right
He don't deserve a woman like you, woman you are

You never knew that goodbye could hurt so much
Till the morning he told you he was going away
He lied to you, mistreated you, he even raised his hand to you
You weathered the storm, but ended up in the rain

It's driving you crazy, you're wondering maybe
Think it's something you did wrong
You carried his baby, but now, now, now, lady
Can't you see that you're so strong?

You were so strong
The sun's gonna shine again, it won't be long

Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
This is something that you must go through
Everything is gonna be alright, find someone who would treat you right
Very sorry that he hurt you

Oh, the time has come to place all your fears aside
You owe it to yourself to give love another try
With someone who'll care for you, true to you
Make dreams realities for you, the rain is over
Just dry all the tears from your eyes

It's driving me crazy, I'm telling you, baby
You ain't done nothing wrong
Take care of your baby, but na, na, na, lady
Can't you see that you're so strong?

Oh, baby, you were so strong
The sun's gonna shine again
It won't be long

Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
This is something that you must go through
Everything is gonna be alright, find someone who would treat you right
Very sorry that he hurt you

Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
This is something that you must go through
Everything is gonna be alright, find someone who would treat you right
Very sorry that he hurt you

Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
This is something that you must go through
Everything is gonna be alright, find someone who would treat you right
Very sorry that he hurt you

Everything is gonna be alright, broken hearts are a part of life
This is something that you must go through
Everything is gonna be alright, find someone who would treat you right
Very sorry that he hurt you
