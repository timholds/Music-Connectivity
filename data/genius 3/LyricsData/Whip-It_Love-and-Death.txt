[Verse 1]
Crack that whip and
Give the past the slip
Step on a crack
And break your momma's back
When a problem comes along
Before the cream sits out too long
When something's going wrong

[Hook]
Now whip it
Into shape
Shape it up
Get straight
Go forward
Move ahead
Try to detect it
It's not too late
To whip it
Whip it good

[Verse 2]
Crack that whip
And give the past the slip
Step on a crack
And break your momma's back
When a good time turns around
You will never live it down
No one gets their way (whip it)

[Hook]

[Bridge]
I say whip it
Whip it good
I say whip it
Whip it good

[Bridge 2]
I say whip it (WHIP IT, WHIP IT!)
Whip it good
I say whip it (WHIP IT, WHIP IT!)
Whip it good

[Hook]

[Bridge]
