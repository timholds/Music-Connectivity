Give me a song
Makes my heart feel open
Give me a song
Makes my hair stand on end

So when I hear that song
Does my heart good
So when I hear that song
Does my heart well

Tell me tell me true
As true as you're living
Be the medicine for my broken heart

So when I hear that song
Does my heart good
So when I hear that song
Does my heart well

I listened for you in the pouring rain
Listened for you over roaring seas
Silent as a lamb
The beating of the heart is calling
"I will always be there darling
I was always there."
"I am always there darling
I was always there."
Listen?

Make me dream of a time we set
A day we wed
Take me to the place
Where we call "Our Song"

So when I hear that song
Does my heart good
So when I hear that song
Does my heart well
I want to hear that song
Does my heart good
I want to hear that song!
