[Verse 2: ScHoolboy Q & Travis Scott]
Bottom bitch say ho!
Know you on top when the top get floored
Crib where the cop won't go
Rollie on bling bling, neck on ice
Tell a bitch get right, make a nigga miss that flight
Can a nigga hit that twice
Should have never let us niggas in
Got my first M 2012
Now a hundred K in the mail
Free another homie on bail
Money low her pussy gon' sell
Tryna tell me money ain't shit
When you tried to tell me water won't whip
When you tried to say this quarter won't flip
Since Snoop who the other rich crip
How Groovy get the Pringle man chip
Walk on with a twenty yard clip
Walk on while a real nigga limp
Black nigga green grass no golf
So on turn the satellite off from the set
Feel like I died on that cross hang on

[Hook: Travis Scott & ScHoolboy Q]
Ok, ok, ok
Already know it's gon' be alright
Way we going up we might be all night
Ok, ok
Now we gon' blow like the wind
Should have never let us niggas in
Ok, ok, ok
Should have never let us niggas in
Should have never, should have never let us niggas in
Should have never let us niggas in
Sh-sh-should have never let us niggas in
Should have never let us niggas in
Sh-sh-should have never let us niggas in
Ok, ok
