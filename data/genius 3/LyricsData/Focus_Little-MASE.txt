(Intro)
Yeah it's Little MASE
It's that time of year again
What I got to do this year?

(Hook 1)
You need to to get up in your zone and focus hold shit down  for the lo and its notice
Own this  contest this time just rhyme  don't speak nonsense reach for the moment
Hit them with a quick left then step midwest and let them witness a unique  explosion
Increase exposure  don't derp around  set up goals first round release what your holding

(Verse 1)
I should of took control of the jack o lyric cypher
But was preparing for a party had 2 packs some beer and wisers
I dawned a verbal mask then which I task ya to decypher
It's written like a meme cause once you catch it you'll be mindfucked

If hip hop was a game I'd be a aggravated miner
Working underground no funds around no coal or even iron
No ore to forge a sword nor a store to be a buyer
But these crafted lines from 8 bit blocks of clay could slay a spider

But if this shit was cod your ghost I'd have to play a sinpa
If you camp big Shawn and Tyler from The Masters here would find ya
Catch you camping in a corner throw some flash grenades to blind ya
Never mind cause I don't play games I can't afford to waste the time ta

(Hook 2)
You need to get up in your zone and focus hold shit down  for the lo and its notice
Own this  contest this time just rhyme  don't speak nonsense reach for the moment
Hit em with a quick left then step midwest and let them witness a unique  explosion
Increase exposure  don't derp around it's the  second round go beast on opponents

(Verse 2)
The game to me is work and I'm a active nine to fiva
Bout to grab the axe designed To slash though spines and tackle rhymas
Force the acts in back to step to bat on wax attack and blast the gat
At cats who smash on tracks for laughs as fast as they can find em

The purpose of this verse its not enacting rage inside ya
It's to push the fucking bar up so you have to raise it higha
Cerebral Token PFV Syko Solja ya'll all seem to be
The emcee's in my league to beat  for fascinating writes


You've came and conquered  contests causing caskets to retire
But how you think you size up to the stacks of names that's brighta
Do you only have a comeback when guys masturbate behind ya
Or will you choose to get in line ta prove whose actually nica


If your new I've gotta tell you to retract in fear of fightas
That are practically perfectionists whose practice makes then tighta
Then some ratchet hoes that go round stashing crack in they vaginas
Take a snort then hit the airport to go catch a plane to china


Which mid atmosphere ignite and ends up crashing in Regina
So they cash out and they catch up with their cash up in a diner
Pouring catch up on their fries you cannot match up to my rise I
Bet you cats still wouldn't catch up if you grasped what my disguise was
