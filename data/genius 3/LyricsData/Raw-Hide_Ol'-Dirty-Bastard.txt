[Intro: Ol' Dirty Bastard + (some Jamaican woman)]
Yeah!
I wanna let allllll y'all niggas know in here tonight
That this is that Wu-Tang shit
This that shit that's gonna get you high... {*echoes*}
See when you stimulate your own mind, for one common cause
You see, who's the real motherfuckers
See what you see, is you what you see
(You nuh see it? Wu-Tang a-run tings!)
Be the original G
Rhymin on timin and in the place to be
(Run blood claat tings!)
They love see meeeeeeee!

[Verse 1: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
You're a crossbreed, I'm a knowledge seed
I want ACTION, that's what I need
I never put doubt in my mind
Cause I know when I touch the mic it's the rhyme
See murder which is caused
When you fuck with the negative and positive charge
Then they came up, out my garage
With the hit that's gonna be LARGE
Tired of sittin on my fuckin ass
Niggas I know, be runnin around with mad fuckin cash
Who the FUCK wanna be an emcee
If you can't get paid, to be a fuckin emcee?
I came out my momma pussy -- I'm on welfare
Twenty-six years old -- still on welfare!
So I gotta get paid fully
Whether it's truthfully or untruthfully
With my Boston bloodthirsty posse
P-E-A-C-E

[Chorus: Method Man]

Move em in move em in
Move em out move em out
Stick it up {*whip sound*} raw hide!

[Verse 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yea, gotta come back to attack
Killin niggas who said they got stacks, cause I don't give a fuck
{*inhales*} I wanna see blood, whether it's period blood
Or bustin your fuckin face, some blood!!
I'm goin out my FUCKIN mind!!
Everytime I get around devils {*breathing hard*}
Let me calm down, you niggas better start runnin
Cause I'm comin, I'm dope like fuckin heroin
Wu-Tang Bloodkin, a goblin, who come tough like lambskin
Imagine, gettin shot up with Ol Dirty insulin {*sucks air*}
You bound to catch AIDS or somethin
Not sayin I got it, but nigga if I got it you got it!!
WHAT?!? {*echoes*}

[Verse 3: Raekwon the Chef]
Yo, check the bulletproof fly shit, strong like thai stick
Then I'll remain to tear your frame, while I freaks it
Like some fly new sneaks and shit
Now EAT my shit, bitch tried to creep and got hit
Now regulate, and I'll be out to set up a date
Wu-Tang, is bangin like a Ron G tape
RZA pump the shit just like a shotty
Watch me run it John Gotti
Collidin on the track, like gin and watty
Check the calender, I warn any challenger
To step up {*whoosh*} feel the blast from the silencer

[Chorus]

[Verse 4: Method Man]
Comin soon to a theatre near you it be the Wu
Yeah find yourself in the square and see it's true
Actual facts to snack on and chew
My positive energy sounds peace to you
A wise man killed one horse and made glue
Wicked women puttin period blood in stew
Don't that make the stew witches brew?
I fear for the eighty-five that don't got a clue
How could he know what the fuck he never knew?
God-Cypher-Divine come to show and come to prove
A mystery god that's the work of Yacub
The Holy Ghost got you scared to death kid boo!!

[Outro: Ol' Dirty Bastard]
Yeah, we always gotta keep it fly
Fly for you to feel, what you wants to feel
See Wu-Tang'd like to thank, all the people across the country
All the people in America, all the people outside of America
For listenin to our music
We gotta keep it fly for ya
See this ain't somethin new
That's just gonna come out of nowhere, no!!!
This is somethin OLD, and DIRTY!!
And DIRTY!!
Yeah..
