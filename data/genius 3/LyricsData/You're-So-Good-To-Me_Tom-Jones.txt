When I feel low, I go to your embrace
You know the way to put a smile back on my face
Just the touch of your hand can change a man
Oh, girl, you're so good for me

And when it seems the dreams I build upon
Will all come tumbling down and everything goes wrong
Just by holding me tight, you make everything seem so right
Oh, girl, you're so good for me

Girl, you give me something more than love
Something I never know
Even when you're by my side
I don't feel so alone

I'll give you everything I have to give
I'll go on loving you as long as I may live
And whatever I do, I'll do for you
Oh, girl, you're so good for me

You're so good for me
