Intro:

"You'll feel some pain, but I know, you can here me"
"Get out of my head" *gun shot*

What, ("You feel some pain..")
It's like this, what, what
Check it out, yo

[Shogun Assasson]
This is war niggas, a duel to the death
You better make sure your swords sharp
And you got a lion heart
Cause, I strike for the throat
And stab them with a deadly note
That pierces the eardrums
Dose off the equilibrium
Now you're stunned
Another victim of the Shogun
A spinal tap to the cerebrum
So, go ahead, try to run in advance
Cause I stand firm on my warrior stance
Ready to be-head you, dead you
Rid your body of a soul, make it an empty vessel
Because, your rhymes ain't punctual
Not actual or factual, that's why I verbally attack you

[Islord]
Yo, aiyyo, aiyyo, aiyyo check this
Thousand dollar line for line paragraph causin' ruckus
Towards y'all, weak motherfuckin analog niggas
Tryin' to come into the mist of my digital shit
You get flipped on, snapped on your collar bone
And a spike, cause I don't like snake niggas in my eyesight
Cause, I'm so agile and so quick to pull
My razorblade sharp sword out the case
And chop your face, disgrace y'all to another place with
No traces left behind, where the body was laid out
For the coroners to figure out
That it was one swing by the guillotine
That decapitated his head from his shoulders

"You can here me"
"Get out of my head"

[Beretta 9]
Yo, we're holdin' straps of fire to make gunmen retire
Or pristine slugs that penetrated your entire
Physical, that left niggas critical
Killarmy the black son to make all fuckin nine planets digable
With the science to control ninety-nine, keep all minds aligned
All the selfish will be dealt with by the nine
M-M which stands for marksman, regard the last swordsman
Which chop off your head if you don't live accordin
I sincerely love Allah's mathematics, camouflage fabrics
I got a revolver, fuck automatics, the black Asiatic
Lickin multiple shots at your motherfuckin attic

[9th Prince]
Yo, I'm a legendary swordsman, bionic man like Steve Austin
Seven horsemen, wu-ninjas move across coarse sands
I murder niggas wit my bare hands
It's darkness in the wu-caves
We hang crusades, salute grenades, the sixty waves like a raid
My pistol has an infrared, Desert Eagle
Loiter or lead, blast the brains out of apple heads
I leave MC's and DJ's on twin set deathbeds
Underworld status, the black knight like Gladys
Destroy the midnight train, my domain is built like galactics
Beretta 9 the killin' machine
Shogun Assason is that nigga who chases you in your dreams
Killa Sin will kill again with the same knife
The Thief of Bagdad could steal your life
PR Terrorist and Prince Saddam rules the middle-eastern region
It's razorblade season, so all you putty-faced niggas is badly bleedin

[Killa Sin]
Yo, I'm like a landmine, schemin' on air-time
Keepin' on the standby, flight and blow the crowd with their hands high
From Now Y, amplify sounds shut the coliseum down
First round, face down, lace clowns like a nightgown
Light brown, dick em down
Eyes wide as I recite, beamin' the mic
With satellites, tri-state cream
To travel right, fleein' the scene
Team fight with the livest MC's
So, Killarm, strike your moment of silence
Live degrees, well you're eatin' them off
That's the reason why your legion fell off
You popped corns wanna be war pawns
Once, the war's on, and Al Pachino won the last of red dawn
Open mic session, bury you
Spark a party up, somethin terrible
The pain that my niggas bring forth is unbearable
Yo, I'm tellin' you...it's da fuck

Outro:  *various talk over samples*

"Arm make them, Killarm's born man"
"You'll feel some pain, but I know, you can here me"
"Get out of my head" *gun shot*
"...born man, Killarm's born man"
"You'll feel some pain, but I know, you can here me"
"Get out of my head"
"You'll feel some pain, but I know, you can here me"
"Get out of my head" *gun shot*
