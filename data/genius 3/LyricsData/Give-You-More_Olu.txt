[Verse 1]
(She Said....)
Give in or give up, its in or its out when you're dealing with us
Go through pain and fight and fuss but without that there'd be no love
Somethings just don't last forever, We're just tryna last together
Say we need to spend more time and I agree, I really wanna
But I'm caught between my wants, your needs, and what I'm tryna be
Tryna be the best I can successful with this music thing
And tryna be the best for you, but you can probly do better
Can't see enough of eachother, spend all my time making records
Girls like her are hard to find, plus shes more than feeling me
Careless bout my rapping status, she just wants to be with me
She's different than them other girls, money ain't a thing to her
And drama ain't a problem cus she's only tryna make it work
Uh, Uh, She tell me she's just tryna make it worth it
Uh, Uh, And that I gotta put my work in
I told her tell me how to act, I'd hate to see you hurtin
Then she said just give me more, I told her: you my world girl I will...

[Hook: The xx]
Make you feel like never before, I can give so much more
Please don't say we're done when I'm not finished, cus I can give so much more
And I was struggling to get in...left waiting outside your door
Please don't say we're done when I'm not finished, cus I can give so much more

[Verse 2]
Now she'd be blowing up my phone but I'd be burried in the studio
Got her calling, talking bout the things she wanna do to me
We skypin on a friday night she's sexier on video
Lil ma was home alone so I ain't bout to give that up
Instead of laying tracks I had her laying on her back
Pressing, kissin her ribs, naval, hips, and all of that
We was grindin.....but together like it should be
Until she took my phone, she read my texts, and gave this look to me
Lied bout where I said I was. Some things you just gotta do
Girl I gotta life to live, add that up with work and you
Last night I was just partying instead of in the studio
I've only got one life to live girl why can't you just let this go?
She think I'm cheatin, think I got one on the sidelines
Just cus I'm that rapper who the groupies wanna ride on
I keep you close cus you the first that didn't want to stay
Its hard to find a love that's real when those who say they love you fake

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I said some goals to be the best there ever was with it
But that's on hold cus you the best I ever was with
You gotta man but your man's got demanding fans
I hope you understand that I can only see you when I can
That just wasn't good enough, now she don't respond my texts
Left me looking for a new chick I'm compatible with
This be the life of most of the rockstar and the rapper types
Say we play and can't commit, Now I hope you realize why
This song goes out to anybody grindin, workin hard
Who couldn't make it home in time to see the one they love
And tried to balance out their needs with everything they want
But couldn't so they had to let go and just move on
There comes a time in life when you will break somebody's heart
Intentional or accidental, shit it could be yours
So I just hold my own, avoiding love right from the start
And maybe soon I'll rest my heart but till that happens I'mma just....

[Hook]
