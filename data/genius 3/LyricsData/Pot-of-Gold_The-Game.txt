[Hook: Chris Brown]
Oh, the spotlight is not for me
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home
I miss the days when life was simple
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow
In search of the pot of gold
Woah, woah
In search of the pot of gold

[Verse 1: The Game]
It's a mother out there right now 'bout to have the next LeBron
Searchin' for a pot of gold like a leprechaun
They say death comes in threes, who's next in line?
And I just lost a best friend for the second time
Now I'm on a quest to find peace
Still gotta carry my piece and, "Soo Woo!" when it's reppin' time
Y'all don't understand, I'm misunderstood
Give Interscope two more albums then I'm done for good
Sold 10 million records, ain't leave the hood
It's a cold world, everybody need a hood
And everybody doin' time, stay headstrong
You still got a chance to live even though you dead wrong

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Oh, the spotlight is not for me
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home
I miss the days when life was simple
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow
In search of the pot of gold
Woah, woah
In search of the pot of gold

[Verse 2: The Game]
Sometimes I try to do good but I just can't be
It's hard to get myself to do things that ain't me
And y'all should thank me
But my haters busy tryna send me home early
But you can't New Orlean Saint me
I ain't a saint B, I ain't a god, God
I ain't a angel neither, but I try hard, y'all
I'm lightin' up for all my soldiers at war
As I sit back and watch the ashes on my cigar fall
Wayne just came home and Tip back on the yard dawg
Guess Pujols ain't the only one playin' hard ball

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Oh, the spotlight is not for me
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home
I miss the days when life was simple
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow
In search of the pot of gold
Woah, woah
In search of the pot of gold

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
Oh, see the thing about all of us is
We never know just what we were

[Hook: Chris Brown]
Oh, the spotlight is not for me (no it ain't)
I close my eyes and imagine I'm home (home)
I miss the days when life was simple (yeah)
But if I never tried to follow that rainbow
In search of the pot of gold (in search for the pot of gold)
Woah, woah
In search of the pot of gold (in search for the pot of gold)
