Lexi Lulu I see you out here shining
Looking good, purple suit, fresh gators
Carolina Country, coming from the bottom
You know they hating, but you doing your thing

Lexicon
Thank you honey, I appreciate it
You know me, blessed to breathe

Verse 1 (Lexicon)
Used to eat peanut butter for dinner
No one thought I could utter this vision
Got touched when I was young no grudge its forgiven
Leave it to karma too much drama to worry about intermissions
The lure that I endured leave you shaken like Parkinson's
I don’t whine all my breezys sipping moscato dipping for papo
Wonder if it be a blunder to fondle
I don’t take credit cause Id rather get cash
Where I'm headed  got indebted to the life fast
Thought about suicide but losing life is selfish
Try to be moving right up in a hellish environment
I relish conspiring on consignment
Some talk so loud but they actions so quiet
I don’t like fiction but she got a tall tale
Can I enjoy flesh's vision  living in lords wealth
Fantasize better days forever lay in success
Today I'm blessed to stand glamorized where I rest

Chorus (Lexicon and Lanee' Jones)
I been blessed to breathe
And life priceless so today gets the best of me
I been blessed to breathe
In a crisis but the breathe of god gone set me
Free
Repeat(1)

Verse 2 (Lexicon)
I favor the accomplished like I did something for you
Perception is a problem when so many adore you
Step forward headed toward  green like a stop light
Just to bless another brother vexed in block life
Cold outside  trends of men make you cop ice
3 below give you fever though when the heat cock right
Here's a picture of my life but that get taken
So I'm given you a portrait  I'm the artist that made it
Savoring my savings for a taste of wealth
This your outlook if you had faced my death
Black bastard basking in the fires of the father
Black doubt telling me I can't go farther
But I persevere through burning tears
Daddy drank to much fire water
Approaching light ain't no curtains here
So tell your vision boy and time a warn you
Trying to get a mill let me make my order

Chorus (2)

Verse 3 (Lexicon)
Might burn the clutch if you the first in gear
Them metals gone rust from being round the peers
I'm moving at an optimal pace
Caught my stride so I guess I'm in a optical race caught in the chase
They fast out here cause they ain't eating
Tainted demon trying to pull u from your blessings teaching
I'm just trying to have a pleasant time
Elevate the peasant mind
By lines said in rhyme of present finds
Life ain't fair but I'm on a roller coaster
Trying to get there so I maintain focus
Actions be vial like them red tops
A village of villains the block a skillet watch lead pop
I eat with herbivores turning war for the green trees
Lawyers absorbed with cutting corners so they fiend fees
Used to prey for wisdom but I couldn’t hunt it down
The feats I achieved know I done my momma proud

Chorus
I been blessed to breathe
And life priceless so today gets the best of me
I been blessed to breathe
In a crisis but the breathe of god gone set me free
I been blessed to breathe
And life priceless so today gets the best of me
I been blessed to breathe
