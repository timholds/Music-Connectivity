Cruising cruising
Take care stand there watch out for meter rights
Take care stand there right at the traffic lights
Cruising cruising
Take care stand there stranger approaching sight
Take care stand there cat's eyes are shining bright

Don't complain you might never feel like this again
On the windowpane you see the rain you move into the outside lane
And you want to change remain the same before you go insane
And i still maintain if you never brake you'll overtake the pain
And you know you'll learn a lot and every time that you stop
Feeling good behind the wheel cruising in the mobile

Cruising cruising
Take care stand there if life's not fair
Take care stand there twilight's only ware
Cruising cruising
Take care stand there if life's not fair
Take care stand there twilight's only ware
