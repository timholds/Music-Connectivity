[Verse]
One-two, one-two, testing, I said one-two
One-two, one-two, ya'll niggas know just how I do
Let's get more paper, more bread
It grindtime, I ain't fucking 'round, kid
Got a new case, D's ain't got no proof
Got a new coupe, it ain't got no roof
Test me, see if I won't shoot
I'll cock that and bang that quick for the loot
Trey deuce, got it stashed in the booth
If there's a problem I get to the roof
Go 'head get your ass shot then Q
You talk too much, boy, I'll put you on mute
Even me would need more than a vest
And more than one strap I guess
You got me all fucked up
I might just get your whole clique stuck up
Then come back and sell you your shit back
I'm known for grimey shit like that
Ask around, niggas know me good
South Side, nigga, this my hood

[Hook]
Well, if you're leaving then leave
On your way out leave my keys
Well, if you're leaving then leave
If you're leaving then leave
Well, if you're leaving then leave
Get to walking and leave my V

[Interlude]
So happy, huh?
Yeah, what happened, girl?
What's happening?
Come on, yeah, come on, come on

[Hook]

[Interlude]
So sorry, I'm sorry
No no, come on, come on
We gonna take it up a notch now

[Hook]

[Outro]
Ho, calm down, baby
You're overreacting
Oh, I got y'all back in Bentley's
Can't mistreat me, baby
I won't let you, no
Quit lying to me
Cause I'mma retry the V
You make me feel crazy
You know you my first baby
You're not gonna go away
Sit your ass down right here
It's 50, come on, bounce with me, come on
Just makes me feel good, man
Yeah, next level shit
Uh uh uh, come on
Well, if you're leaving then leave
You want me to be your man
You know you need me, girl
I don't know why you're acting the way you're acting
You love me, let me hear you say you love me
Oh, now you don't wanna say it cause everybody listening
Oh, you full of shit, man, it's cool, it's cool
You love me later, you love me long time
