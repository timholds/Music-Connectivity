[Intro]
Heh-heh... I'm The Rib Man

[Chris Rock]
Emperor, contemperor
So many girls they call me the Pimperor
Never date a girl with a weave! (Why Chris?)
Because a girl with a weave's got a trick up her sleeve
My wallet's so fat, had to put it on a diet
A sucka said run it and I said don't try it
He thought I was a punk just because I was quiet
Smacked him with a brick; got a suite at, the Hyatt
My future's so bright that I gotta wear shades
My pocket's so fat that my dog's got a maid
My manager's name is Reuben Kincaid
The only white boy with a high top fade
Now I'm chillin hard (hard!) I used to be poor (poor!)
They used to tease me when I worked at the store
Now your hamster's dead, your girl's name is Fred
And to top it off, YOUR MOTHER'S GOT A BIG HEAD!

[Chorus]
Big head! YOUR MOTHER'S GOT A BIG HEAD!
Big head! I said YOUR MOTHER'S GOT A BIG HEAD!
Big head! I said YOUR MOTHER'S GOT A BIG HEAD!
Big head! YOUR MOTHER'S GOT A BIG HEAD!

[Interlude]
Aight aight, first off, you wanna sign on me?
Bet bet, you big Marion-Berry-haircut-havin' muh-
Yo, first of all, your mother got a Nike tag on her wig
And they call her Hair Jordan

[Chris Rock]
Ace of the staff, top pick of the draft
You're so dumb, you failed first grade math
I'm quicker than Leonard, hit harder than Hearns
Your mother's so old that she fucked George Burns, ha!
My rhymes are fixed and your rhymes are broken
I drive a Benz, you drive a deuce and a token
You have no friends, you have no will
But like a skinhead on Soul Train - YOU DON'T FIT IN, BOYYY!
When I was a kid, I used to be plump
But now I get more rump than Donald Trump
You're so broke, you got a bird for a beeper
When it goes off, it goes "Cheap-cheap-cheapa"
Now I'm chillin hard (hard!) I used to be poor (poor!)
They used to tease me when I worked at the store
Now your dog is dead, you still wear Keds
And to top it off, YOUR MOTHER'S GOT A BIG HEAD!

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
First of all, ya big Foghorn-Leghorn-belly-havin'
Yo yo, your mother got an afro so big
When she sat in my car it had instant tint windows

[Chorus]
[Chris Rock]
My jeans are ripped and yours are corroded
Your mother's so big that her panties exploded
I don't wanna say that your mother's FAT!
But I saw her put BBQ sauce on her cat
Your breath's so stink that you need Binaca
Your girl looks like Orville Redenbacher
I live to save life and my pockets get bigger
You're a daredevil, they call you Evel Kni-NIGGA
You see my Rolex and you lose your smile
Cause all you can afford is a Flintstone sundial
My jeans are ripped and my drawers are silk
Your mother is so cheap she gave you cereal for breast milk
Now I'm chillin hard (hard!) I used to be poor (poor!)
They used to tease me when I worked at the store
Now your hamster's dead, your cat's got dreads
And to top it off, YOUR MOTHER'S GOT A BIG HEAD!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
A rib about your mother!
Yo, peace to everybody, my homeboy Eddie Murphy
Yaknomsayin, Damon Wayans, Michael Jackson
Yo, you don't know Michael Jackson! Yo, yo' mother
Yo' MOTHER don't know Michael Jackson!
Man you better stop eatin that pork, boy~!
YOUR MOTHER'S GOT A BIG HEAD!
