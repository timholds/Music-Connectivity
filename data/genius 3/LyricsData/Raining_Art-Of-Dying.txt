Jonny Hetherington
I'm scared to look down
Never been so high
And I can't look up
With a closing mind

I'm scared to be touched
I don't like the feel
It's way too close
Way too real

'Cause inside it's rainin'
It never lets up
I know I'm crazy
Crazy enough
To know that I'll find
A way to make this all go away

Adam Gontier
I'm scared to be me
'Cause I look like you
I don't wanna be somebody
I never knew

I'm scared to go out
I'm so far in
I hear it's nice
But I never been

Jonny Hetherington
'Cause inside it's rainin'
It never lets up
I know I'm crazy
Crazy enough
To know that I'll find
A way to make this all go away

I found my only out
So just forget about
Talkin' me down
(Yeah!)

I'll put this fire out
And stop the burnin'

Inside it's rainin'
It never lets up
I know I'm crazy
Crazy enough
To know that I'll find
A way to make this all go away

Inside it's rainin'
It never lets up
I know I'm crazy
Crazy enough
To know that I'll find
A way to make this all go away

Inside it's rain...
(Gontier: I'll make this all go away)
Inside it's rainin'
(Gontier: I'll make this all go away)
Inside it's rainin'
(Gontier: I'll make this all go away)
Inside it's rainin'
(Gontier: I'll make this all go away)
