[Verse 1]
Days pass by in this lonely abyss
Falling sky and the worlds closing in
Dance with demons, so I'm not alone
I won't break cause revenge is a place I call home

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Soon you will know
Not to throw stones
The glass house, oh

[Chorus]
Locked in a cage, feeling the rage
I'm alone inside (alone inside)
Counting the days that we escape
I will eat you alive (eat you alive)
Like a [?] I still [?] at night
Locked in a cage, feeling the rage
Burning up inside
With my last breath of life
I will eat you alive

[Verse 2]
Time of the eye I've learned to embrace
Better memories I know like the taste
Swirling up like a phoenix inside
From the ashes, I'll find you, there's nowhere to hide

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Biting my time
You can't confine
Watching my mind

[Chorus]
Locked in a cage, feeling the rage
I'm alone inside (alone inside)
Counting the days that we escape
I will eat you alive (eat you alive)
Like a [?] I still [?] at night
Locked in a cage, feeling the rage
Burning up inside
With my last breath of life
I will eat you alive

[Bridge]
Digging a hole
Bleeding in the dirt
Lighting a flame
Er, it's gonna hurt
Like a stone in the ground
There's a devil within
I'm coming for you
I'll never give in

[Chorus]
Locked in a cage, feeling the rage
I'm alone inside (alone inside)
Counting the days that we escape
I will eat you alive (eat you alive)
Like a [?] I still [?] at night
Locked in a cage, feeling the rage
Burning up inside
With my last breath of life
I will eat you alive
