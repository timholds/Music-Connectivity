I gotta feeling

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling (Ooo-hoo)

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling (Ooo-hoo)

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feel...

Tonight's the night

Let's live it up

I got my money

Let's spend it up

Go out and smash it

Like, oh my God!

Jump off that sofa

Let's get - get off

I know that we'll have a ball

If we get down and go out

And just lose it all

I feel stressed and

I wanna let it go

Let's go way out spaced out

And losing all control

Fill up my cup

Mazel tov

Look at her dancin'

Just take it... off

Let's paint the town

We'll shut it down

Let's burn the roof

And then we'll do it again

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

Let's do it, and do it, and do it

Let's live it up

And do it, and do it, and do it, do it, do it

Let's do it, let's do it, let's do it

'Cause I gotta feeling (Ooo-hoo)

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feeling (Ooo-hoo)

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good night

That tonight's gonna be a good, good night

A feel...

Feel the shot, body rock

Round and round, up and down

Around the clock (Clock, clock, clock, clock)
