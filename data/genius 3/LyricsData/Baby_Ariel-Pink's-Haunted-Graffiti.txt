[Intro]
Oooh baby
Oooh baby

[Verse 1]
When we're out in the moonlight
Looking up at the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you
Holding hands and making love

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh baby
You're baby
You're baby
Yes oh baby

[Verse 2]
Sandy beach and just making love
As the tide moves in on us
Feels so good walking side by side
Want to be with you all my life

[Chorus]
Ooh ooh baby
You're so baby
You're so baby
Yes oh baby

[Verse 3]
Dreams of you all the time
Feels so good, I want to get that right (ha ha ha ha!)
Just can't wait until tomorrow
Hey come on, baby, let's shake it

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oooh baby
Yes oh baby
Yes oh baby
