[Verse]
I know a woman
Her husband died and he left her
With two little children
So she went back to school
And she got a degree in business
Yeah, now she owns one
And she taught those kids
You can do anything
With the heart of a true believer
Yeah, she's an American dreamer
And I've got a woman
And she waits for me with the light on
Because she knows I'm coming
And she talks about babies
And building a house in the country
Yeah, where it's sunny
And she's got faith that can do anything
But she'll never know how much I need her
Yeah, she's an American Dreamer
Back in the sixties, well Haggard's in prison
He's thinking about writing a tune
And a guy named Armstrong was crazy enough
To think he could walk on the moon
And a preacher named King, well he had a dream
He believed we could all live as one
And a soldier somewhere is praying for peace
While he's cleaning his gun
American dreamers
And I had a father;
He said son if something ain't real
Then you don't even bother
And he wasn't a saint
But, I'd swear the man walked on water
Yeah and he taught me
I ain't just a long-legged hell-raising
Son of a pipe-lining, honky-tonk singer
Yeah, I'm an American dreamer
I'm an American dreamer
