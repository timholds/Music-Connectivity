[Verse 1]
Timing can’t help me out
As a way to get better
Feeling is all I have
To get a little bit closer

Find the words I need to see
I can feel my fever start to break
Taking time to hesitate
And I know the season’s about to change

[Verse 2]
Timing has caught me out
But the days keep living
Throwing my heart around
It’s been a long time coming

Even if it sounds surreal
You can always find it in my hand
Think of what's the play appeals
Before I know my instinct leaves the scene
