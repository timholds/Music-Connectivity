Carrying my own in the afternoon
Hiding a spoon she will be soon
Waiting fork brings a knife
Spends me her joke, she slips me alive

Carrying my own in the afternoon
Hiding a spoon she will be soon
Waiting fork brings a knife
Spends me her joke, she slips me alive

Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care

Carrying my own in the afternoon
Hiding a spoon she will be soon
Waiting fork brings a knife
Spends me her joke, she slips me alive

Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
Oh, sitting on my chair where nobody want to care
