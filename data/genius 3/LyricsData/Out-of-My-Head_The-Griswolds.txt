[Refrain]
Don't call my phone, coz nobody's home
It's all your fault, I want you out of my head
My head
My head, my head, my head

[Verse 1]
You got your reasons wrong
You can't complain, you can't complain, you don't have anyone to blame
I got the message home
I realized, I realized, I didn't read between the lines
Sweet sensations gone
There was a time, there was a time your eyes would give me butterflies
But now the season's done
You can't deny, you can't deny, I was the reason we survived
Hope you understand
That you fucked it all

[Refrain]
Don't call my phone, coz nobody's home
It's all your fault, I want you out of my head
My head
My head, my head, my head

[Verse 2]
And when I hear your song
It reminds me, it reminds me of a perfect summer night
We danced to Elton John
And I can't pretend, I can't pretend I ever wanted this to end
I hope you understand
I did everything I could with my two hands

[Refrain]
Don't call my phone, coz nobody's home
It's all your fault, I want you out of my head
My head
My head, my head, my head

[Bridge]
I hope you understand
This wasn't everything that I had planned
I hope you understand
I did everything I could with my two hands

[Refrain]
Don't call my phone, coz nobody's home
It's all your fault, I want you out of my head
My head
My head, my head, my head

Don't call my phone, coz nobody's home
It's all your fault, I want you out of my head
My head
My head, my head, my head
