Shut your mouth cause you're talking too much
And i dont give a fuck anyway
You always seem to be stepping in shit
And all you really do is complain
It's your lie, tell it how you like
Small minds tend to think alike
Shut your mouth cause you're talking too much
And i dont give a fuck anyway

[Chorus x4]
LET YOURSELF GO!
LET YOURSELF GO!
LET YOURSELF GO!


GOTTA LET IT GO!
GOTTA LET IT GO!
GOTTA LET IT GO!
GOTTA LET IT GO!

Cut the crap cause you're screamin' in my ear
And you're taking up all of the space
You're really testing my patience again
And i'd rather get punched in the face
You're getting on my every last nerve
Everything you said i already heard
I'm sick to death of your every last breath
And i dont give a fuck anyway!

[Chorus x4]

GOTTA LET IT GO!
GOTTA LET IT GO!
GOTTA LET IT GO!
GOTTA LET IT GO!

I wanna live with Normal People
I wanna breathe with Normal People
I wanna work with Normal People
Wanna be with normal people
Or i'm 'bout to

[Chorus x8]
