[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
I sit around and watch the tube, but nothin's on
I change the channels for an hour or two
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit
I'm sick of all the same old shit
In a house with unlocked doors
And I'm fuckin' lazy

[Hook]
Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind and I smell like shit

[Verse 2]
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key

[Hook]
Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind and I smell like shit

[Bridge]
I got no motivation, where is my motivation?
No time for motivation, smoking my inspiration

[Verse 3]
I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will
My mother says to get a job, but she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun, you're fucking lonely

[Hook - Variation]
Bite my lip and close my eyes, take me away to paradise
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind
And loneliness has to suffice

Bite my lip and close my eyes, I'm trippin' away to paradise
Some say quit or I'll go blind, but that's just a myth
