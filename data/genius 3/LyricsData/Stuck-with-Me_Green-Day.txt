[Verse 1]
I'm not part of your elite
I'm just alright
Class structures waving colors
Bleeding from my throat
Not subservient to you
I'm just alright
Down classed by the powers that be
Give me loss of hope

[Chorus]
Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well, I know I'm not alright

[Verse 2]
What's my price and will you pay it
If it's alright?
Take it from my dignity and
Waste it 'til it's dead
Throw me back into the gutter
'Cause it's alright
Find another pleasure fucker
Drag them down to hell

[Chorus]
Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well, I know I'm not alright

[Bridge]
One, two, three, four!

[Chorus]
Cast out, buried in a hole
Struck down, forcing me to fall
Destroyed, giving up the fight
Well, I know I'm not alright
