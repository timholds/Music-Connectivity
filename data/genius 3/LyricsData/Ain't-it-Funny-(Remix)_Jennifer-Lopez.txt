[Verse 1: Ja Rule]
Murda Inc, ha, ha
It, must, be the ASS - that got me like damn
If they get any fatter
Man, the Rule going to have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
J to the L-O, hello
No, I'm not Lee Harvey Oswald
I'm the Rule and I shot call
"Off the Wall" like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now

[Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny?
It's been awhile since you came around
Now you want to see what's going down
Trying to tell me why you want my time
Trying to tell me how I'm on your mind
See, it never had to be this way
You should have never played the games you played
Now I'm seeing that you're kind of lame
Knowing how the situation change

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See, at first I didn't understand
Now you're looking like a lonely man
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurting 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

[Verse 3: Cadillac Tah]
C-A double D, HA!!!
Double dose ma
Fly by, red line, Testa Rossa
Oh I, never been a sucker for chocha
Spit the ism, hit them, get rid of em
And you know That get it gully
And isn't that funny
How they want me see me working with money
But Caddy isn't a dummy
What these brodies want from me
Because all I got is G, J.LO!!!
And Murda I.N.C

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
I really wish you wouldn't send me gifts
Trying to make me sit and reminisce
Trying to blind me with your blinging bling
Thought I told you love don't cost a thing
Hope you realize that now I'm through
And I don't ever want to hear from you
I had enough of being there for you
Now I'm laughing why you play the fool

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?

[Bridge: Ja Rule & Jennifer Lopez]
Baby, is that your girlfriend
I got my boyfriend
But maybe we can be friends
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah
Baby, I've got my boyfriend
Is that your girlfriend
But maybe we can be friends
Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Ain't that funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny?
