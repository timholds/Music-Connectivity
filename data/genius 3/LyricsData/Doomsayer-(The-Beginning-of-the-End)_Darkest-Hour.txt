[Chorus 1]
You are the only one with ability to turn this tide
With capacity to learn the truth and burn the lies
That signalize our disgust

So come with me, I'll be your doomsayer
And show you everything that you'll never see
Behind borrowed eyes

[Verse 1]
You're living in the end
You're not alone
Decrepit monuments sit on their own thrones
The crushing weight
Relentless in its pull
Resist or be diluted with the rest

[Chorus 2]
All we are
Leads us to inherent insurgence
It leads you to deceive yourself
When you believe you've been bled dry

[Verse 2]
And aren't you sick of waiting?
Waiting for nothing
Facilitating all your demons
Staring at the sun
I watched it rise and collide
With this dream where I had stopped

Living, stopped living in the past
Stopped living with that crash/burn longing
It'll pass
It brings you to your knees
Reliving that same nightmare where you realize...

[Chorus 1]
You are the only one with ability to turn this tide
With capacity to learn the truth and burn the lies
That signalize our disgust

So come with me, I'll be your doomsayer
And show you everything that you'll never see
Behind borrowed eyes

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus 3]
And who can save you?
Not their gods and not their masters
And who will free you?
Look in the mirror

So come with me, I'll be your doomsayer
And show you everything that you'll never see
Behind borrowed eyes
