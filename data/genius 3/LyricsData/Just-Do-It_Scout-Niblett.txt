And the voices said, "Just do it!"
And I think I agree
'Cause someone's got to do it
And it might as well be me
'Cause I'm the doer
I'm the doer
I'm the doer right now
That's some belief in your joy
That's some belief in your joy
That's some belief in your joy
That's some belief in your joy

My planets, my God
Whatever happened to me?
No urge to speak
I silenced you, my guide
And now I'm up here all alone
Like a little jumping Joan
And I'm calling
'Cause I'm wonderin'
Is my team flying?
Is my team flying?
Stand supreme
Stand supreme
Just continue with what you're doin'
Just continue with what you're doin'
