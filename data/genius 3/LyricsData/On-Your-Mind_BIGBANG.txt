Well I'm getting up now
I'm getting up and I'm strong
You'll watch me do it
Don't know why it should take me so long
So long

Now you're together my song's on your mind
Feel how it hurts oh baby it's summertime
Living is easy and I've got nothing to do
Except trying not to think of you

We're moving on now
We're moving on and as they say
It's very important
You gotta get out if you don't wanna stay

So long

Now you're together my song's on your mind
Feel how it hurts oh baby it's summertime
Living is easy and I've got nothing to do
Except trying not to think of you

You're together my song's on your mind

On your mind
On your mind
On your mind
