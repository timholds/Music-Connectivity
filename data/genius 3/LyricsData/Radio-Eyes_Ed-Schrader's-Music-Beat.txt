End it got fuzzy without documents they got radio eyes they got radio eyes
Melancholy dunce with a thimble of brains they got radio eyes they got radio eyes
All them x's and Swedish fish they got dog teeth they got dog teeth
Little Bettie Paige with a vegan disdain they got dog teeth they got dog teeth

Blackbird in the night
You dreamed it all of your life, you dreamed it all of your life
What if I end up knifed
Will I become the wire, will I become the wire?

Send me over cooked chorizo full of hate
They got radio eyes they got radio eyes
Good tats and cheep but them books ain't free
They got radio eyes they got radio eyes
Manicured spikes like your daddy's grass
They got dogteeth they got dog teeth
Walkin round rugged in your baby fat they got dogteeth they got dogteeth

Blackbird in the night
You dreamed it all of your life, you dreamed it all of your life
What if I'm crucified?
Will I become the champ, the king of all the rats?
