"Baby, here I am"

[5FT.]
It's a total eclipse, alone with this track
Once the, moon turns black, the shit is a wrap
Step back, and give this legend some space
So I can, set the pace, I'm not playin' with the case
Call me the, hungry piranha, spit it like the llama
Fifty calibur, ride the road like no tomorrow
I gotta, deliver it hotter, and hotter
Wicked like Chaka, who dealt hot? Lick you a shotgun
Nigga, I top gun, number one question that's asked
Who gonna stop son, nah, nigga, not one
Slaughter the daily order, leave you wetter than water
Rest in peace to my nigga Headquarterz
And big Rah Rah, AVK Crew thick to the sky
All dangerous, all on the front line
Heads up, ears and eyes open
I'ma wolverine with a guillotine, wicked when I stroke it
I do it for the family, the struggle of life
Bought out the hell and the man in me
Being on top of my greatness, is where I plan to be
This is serious business, no time for fantasy
It's 5, BDI Thug and Evil Dee
Duck Down, cuz we buckin' the shot at this industry
