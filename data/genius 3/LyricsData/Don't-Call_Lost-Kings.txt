[Verse 1: Roy English]
But don't stop what you're going to do
Or start a fire that you're going to lose
And don't try
'Cause I can see around you
Don't cry when you hold me back
Say you're fine when you're off the track
Don't lie
'Cause I can see around you

[Pre-Chorus: Roy English]
Trying to get in my mind
You keep calling and wasting my time
'Cause I know, know, know that you did it
Texting into my vibe
'Cause you heard I'm doing alright
Girl, you know, know, know that you did it

[Chorus: Roy English]
Don't call me when you're sorry
Don't call me when you're sad about the way we left things
Don't call me when you're sorry
Don't call me, 'cause you're mad about the way it's ended
Don't call me when you're sorry
Don't call me when you're sad about the way we left things
Don't call me when you're sorry
Don't call me, 'cause you're mad about the way it's ended
Don't call me when you're–

[Verse 2: Roy English]
Put down what you're trying to prove
No spark when you lit the fuse
Don't try, 'cause I know all about you
Don't cry when you're all alone
You say you're fine
But you're on your own
Don't lie, 'cause I know all about you

[Pre-Chorus: Roy English]
Trying to get in my mind
You keep calling and wasting my time
'Cause I know, know, know that you did it
Texting into my vibe
'Cause you heard I'm doing alright
Girl, you know, know, know that you did it

[Chorus: Roy English]
Don't call me when you're sorry
Don't call me when you're sad about the way we left things
Don't call me when you're sorry
Don't call me, 'cause you're mad about the way it's ended
Don't call me when you're sorry
Don't call me when you're sad about the way we left things
Don't call me when you're sorry (oh yeah)
Don't call me, 'cause you're mad about the way it's ended
Don't call me when you're–

[Verse 3: Roy English]
Starting up again
Like you ain't the one that ended it
Say you being real
But you still pretending it
Sliding in my DM
Just to tell me you offended
But I even get it
'Cause you been unfriended
Cut me deep
Why you cut me so deep?
Why you playing Lemonade?
This was supposed to be sweet
Why you playing like I'm Jay
Why you playing like you Bey?
Why you did it?
Why you tryin' to play me?

[Chorus: Roy English]
Don't call me when you're sorry (I bet you feel so bad, I bet you feel so bad right now)
Don't call me when you're sad about the way we left things
Don't call me when you're sorry (I bet you feel so bad, I bet you feel so bad right now)
Don't call me, 'cause you're mad about the way it's ended
Don't call me when you're sorry (I bet you feel so bad, I bet you feel so bad, that you feel it right now)
(I bet you feel so bad, I bet you feel so bad, that you feel it right now)
