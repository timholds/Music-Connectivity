[Verse 1: DL Incognito]
I rhyme about hip-hop because I live it
I'm not a gangsta, or crook, neither a villain
I've never been shot but block nigga's keep grillin'
I pack no weapon, ya'll ain't worth killin'
Never sold no drugs, but the nigga's who did
A knife in the ribs, music's how I'm speakin' to kids
I wanna live, what the fuck son you think that's wrong?
Just because I don't speak about death in my songs
I'm not the criminal type, but obliterate mic's
Nigga's skills seem so minimal when their wright
?? and criticize everyone on my tracks
If you don't like it, don't buy it, it's as simple as that
Realize that we did it ourselves
We took our own money and put it on the shelves
And now we global nigga's, catch me on live with my man opal
Artists rap all alike that's why they stay local
I'm universal like the label, everywhere like I'm NATO
So we make dough, cash prepaid under the table
(We makin' money ya'll) but this ain't got to do with wealth
I've always wanted some cash and a place to myself, so what

Everybody everywhere lemme see 'em

[Verse 2: D-Shade]
I treat every day like it was game seven in overtime
Born to shine, at home, and over border lines
I seen this kid that used to hold dimes, loadin' a nine
Said that he's rollin' in crime, and it's blowin' his mind
Got radio stations, pumpin' one minute sensations
They wanderin' aimless, with no destination
Claimin' they amazin', but nobody's movin'
If that's what you call game, man your plays need improvin'
The crowds booin' and your the crumb of the year
I see you holdin' your hand out, but I got nothin to spare
You must be buggin' like Chekov with that thing in his ear
Instead of running your mouth, you should be running in fear
I'm just putting idea's and stress down on the paper
And haters don't even like themselves so of course they hate ya
*Shhh* while d-shade ??? ???? ?????? ????? preparing the server hater
We found a plate of leftovers from the last of the challengers
And I mop the stage up with you armatures like janitors
If you got nothin' good to say why bother speak?
I heard image is everything and talk is cheap
