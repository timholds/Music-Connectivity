[Verse 1]
I was sitting at the cafÈ for a bite
Couldn’t help but overhear this guy
He just pulled up in a U-Haul truck
Tell Becky how pumped he was
‘Bout movin’ here for his new job
And what a cool little spot it was
Kinda made me jealous, made me mad
Wish I could see this place like that

[Chorus]
Yeah I wish I was new to this town
Just pullin’ in, checkin’ it out
For the first time
Wish I could go anywhere
And not be afraid
Of finding you there
Yeah girl when I see you around
I wish I was new to this town

[Verse 2]
I can’t put my feet on this sidewalk
Without hearin’ you laugh or hearin’ you talk
And every street’s a memory
Of just how good it used to be
I can’t walk into that corner bar
Without someone askin’ how you are
And how you’re doing and how you been
I gotta go through it all again

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I wonder what it feels like
To hop in my truck
And not think about us
Just go for a ride
Stop at that stoplight
Not think about you
Sittin’ here by my side

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I wish I was new to this town, oh yeah
I wish I was new to this town, oh yeah
I wish I was new to this town
Yeah
Wish I was new to this town
