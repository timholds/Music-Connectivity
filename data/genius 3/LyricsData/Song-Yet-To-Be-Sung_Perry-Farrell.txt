Let me tell you
You're at the Jubilee
Or you're all alone
Because the more, the merrier is how
My friends all tell me so
The birds wake up the grass
And they tell everybody
Say it's time to grow
The sun, whispers to the birds
Oh, the song yet to be sung

Song yet to be sung
(Song yet to be sung)
Song yet to be sung

You're at the Jubilee
Or you're all alone
Because the more, the merrier is how
My friends everybody, they all tell us so
From the heights of Zion
I hear, it's whispered in your ear
We get to play on, play on, wild designery!
A little bitty song, a song yet to be sung!

Song yet to be sung
(Song yet to be sung)
Song yet to be sung
Song yet to be sung
(Song yet to be sung)
Song yet to be sung
