[Verse 1]
Pensive and quiet
Like forever was
In a chrysalis, she waits for us
And she takes from us
Oh sweet life, why give and take from us?
It's all for you
It's all for truth

[Chorus 1]
Feels like I'm holding you down
But you won't leave me alone
And you're holding me now
But I'm so far away from you

There's no home
No home like the one I found in you
Now you're running away
Oh, to feel like a child again...

[Verse 2]
And the song he sings, he brings to life for you
It's all for you
It's all for you...

And he words he places on the page just can't admit
This song's for you
This song's for you...

[Chorus 2]
Feels like you're holding me down
But I can't leave you alone
And I'm holding you now
But you're so far and lost to me

There's no home
No home like the one I found in you
Now I'm running away
And I feel like a child again
Oh, to feel like a child again...

[Outro]
And I'm haunted by you
I'm haunted by you

Every song I sing, it brings me back to you
Cause I'm haunted by you
I'm haunted by you
I'm haunted by you...
