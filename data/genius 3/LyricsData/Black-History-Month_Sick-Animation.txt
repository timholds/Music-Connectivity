[Hook]
Don't make it such a mystery
Black history, black history
Don't make it such a mystery
Learn about black history

[Verse 1]
It's black history month kid and what have you done?
It's the "Feb" to the "ru" to the "ary" son
Now listen to my words cause I've just begun
Don't let it go in one ear and fall out the other one
And...

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Martin Luther King told white supremacy to fuck off
And when he'd go to the party he would go off
Two beers in one hand as he'd proclaim his plan
Of a unified race relation across the land
It's Black History Month so get the fuck out of your chair
Throw your hands throw your arms throw your feet up in the air
My name is Malcolm X and I came to have sex
So hit me on my cell with a nasty text
I'm like a vampire bitch when I'm biting your neck
Let my dick get hard as the blood collects
You better wet that pussy cause I'm fucking you next
Yo my name is George (Who?) Washington Carver
A lot of people think I'm just a peanut farmer, but
I did a whole lot more than that
Y'all ever heard of starch?
I invented that
I'm Louis Farrakhan and no I didn't make starch
But I got a million men and we started to march
Walking through the city as it's raining confetti
Now put your mouth on my noodle like a plate of spaghetti
You white bitch...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hey Rosa Parks
My name is Marc
I'd like to pair up with you like it's Noah's Arc
And then maybe we can go get some pizza
Do you like pizza?
I'm kidding, EVERYONE LIKES PIZZA!!
