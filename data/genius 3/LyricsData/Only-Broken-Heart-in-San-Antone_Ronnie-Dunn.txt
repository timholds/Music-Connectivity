[Verse 1]
I had to get out of Galveston
I had to take it on the run
Too many sad reminders of
Losin' a once-in-a-lifetime love
I headed west to San Antone
Oh, what a foolish choice

[Chorus]
I'm the only broken heart
In San Antone tonight
Guess this ain't no place to start
This gettin' on with my life
Everybody's hand in hand
Moonlight walkin', makin' plans
It sure is lonely, when you're the only
Broken heart, in San Antone

[Verse 2]
I look into the clear blue sky
I see the color of her eyes
I watch the river flowin' free
The way her love washed over me
I try to run but I can't hide
'Cause her memory's deep inside

[Chorus]
I'm the only broken heart
In San Antone tonight
This ain't no place to start
This gettin' on with my life
Everybody's hand in hand
Moonlight walkin', makin' plans
It sure is lonely, when you're the only
Broken heart, in San Antone

[Bridge]
Everybody's hand in hand
Moonlight walkin', makin' plans
It sure gets lonely...
When you're the only broken heart
In San Antone tonight
No, this ain't no place to start
This gettin' on with my life

[Outro]
I'm the only broken heart
In San Antone tonight
