[Verse 1]
I'm a hard working man
I wear a steel hard hat
I can ride, rope, hammer and paint
Do things with my hands that most men can't
I can't get ahead no matter how hard I try
I'm getting really good at barely getting by
Got everything I own
By the sweat of my brow
From my four-wheel drive to my cowboy boots
I owe it all to my blue collar roots
I feel like I'm working overtime on a runaway train
I've got to bust loose from this ball and chain

[Chorus]
I'm a hard, hard working man
I got it all on the line
For a peace of the promised land
I'm burning my candle at both ends
'Bout the only way to keep the fire going
Is to outrun the wind

[Verse 2]
Come Friday night
I like to party hard
I carry on with the Cadillac cuties
Spend my whole week's pay on some weekend beauty
Come Monday morning I'm the first to arrive
I ain't nothing but business from nine till five

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I can't wait to get up in the morning
And do it all over again
Well I'm a hard living, hard working man
