[Verse 1]
I know they said life is hard, but damn, can we get a hand?
Can we get a chance, to show the world what we got?
I wish everyone could live on a drug-free block
No cops, no fiends, no shots, our moms and our pops
Don't stop -- I'm inspired by niggas in my section
We're here to die with no sense of direction
One question -- Which way is up?
Wanna even the balance, a couple million ain't enough
Couple burdens is a discount, niggas on sale
Wholesale or retail, a hotel with females
That play dirty, and I should know better
She tryna infiltrate, but I ain't gon' let her
So, have you ever been introduced to a killer
But couldn't figure 'cause his calm demeanour?
It's like night and day when he palm the nina
Caught a body on Dorega and they found it in the freezer
It's never easy and you better believe it
This show is an experience, listen or leave it

[Hook]
Live hard, you could fall in an instant
Die harder, you gotta leave an imprint
It's showin' an experience, pay attention and experience
What it's like to live life
His days, his nights
My pains, my likes
We only speak from experience, pay attention and experience

[Verse 2]
I know they say life ain't easy
But why? We livin' underground
They tryna hold us down
Unlike the rapper that made a few bucks
Success can't shut me up, what the fuck is up?
With this bubblegum music
Fuck it, I said it on cue like a poolstick
I'm serious, a satellite radio
Momma said 'Ain't nothin' worse than a lazy ho'
Young'uns just livin' to die
Sex is at an all-time high
Little queen, body so mean
Had sex with a fiend, got death in her genes
And now she just waitin' to leave
The rebel in me just waitin' to bleed
We don't think of the future, we have fun first
Been to jail for bullshit, but I've done worse
I fade as the choices we make
Pain leads to anger, anger turns to hate
We all got a backseat in the hearse
Yeah I want fame, but my manhood comes first

[Hook]

I swear I told 'em right off the bat
When they let me out the cage, I wasn't coming back
So now our whole world's gon' fail
Sometimes being real can lead to jail
That's why I walk with the humbleness
And my talks on these tracks are thunderous
Homie caught a body, hood got divided
Niggas on the visit, some niggas at the wake
Some people keep it real, others being fake
She wanna be a freak, like do it on tape
Crackheads look for something to sell
Roommates with the devil, watch us living in hell

[Hook]
