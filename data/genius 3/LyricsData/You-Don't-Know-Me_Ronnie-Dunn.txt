[Verse 1]
You give your hand to me
You say, “Hello”
I can hardly speak
My heart is beating so
And anyone can tell
You think you know me well
You don’t know me
No you don’t know the one
Who wants to hold you tight
And dreams of you almost every night
To you I’m just a friend
It’s all I've ever been

[Chorus][x2]
You don’t know me
I never knew the art of making love
My heart aches with love for you
I was afraid and shy, I let love pass me by
A chance that you might want to love me too

[Verse 2]
You take your hand from mine
You say, “Goodbye”
I watch you walk away
With some, with some lucky guy
You’ll never ever know
The one that loved you so
You don’t know me
