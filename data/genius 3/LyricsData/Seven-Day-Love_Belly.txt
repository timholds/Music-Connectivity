[Verse 1: Belly]
You used to hit my phone to make a dick appointment
Used to tell me he was nothing but a disappointment
Used to watch him suffer for your own enjoyment
And he would send you checks for nothing like its unemployment
Back to the streets that I roam like Caesar's home
I sleep alone don't need a throne to each his own
She's cold my sheets cold I dream alone
Invested in her but now she'd rather be alone
I keep a black rose that in the back of a black Rolls
That I use like a black hearse no church just black clothes
Hold up, I lay back and took the last sip
I told her my dick taste like the last bitch
Pic reveal, this shit is real
And if these drugs don't kill me I swear these bitches will
Your picture on my windowsill I just get the chills
But somethin's missin' from the picture still

[Hook: Belly & Ashanti]
Layin' in this bed I don't even sleep
Summer come around we don't even speak
Say you goin' away I don't even reach ya
Seven day love got me feelin' weak
Oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord

[Verse 2: Belly]
I used dream about her even fiend about her
Bad bitches she got a team around her
I was the plug when she needed power
I show up and her leaning like the Pisa tower
Life's a bitch and you can't play in fate
Then she broke my heart and left a band-aid
I wish we fell in love with our eyes closed
Say the word and I'ma show up with the blindfolds
Flexin', you always flexin' fuck all your exes
You in the baller section tryna teach us all a lesson
So I don't bother calling you don't bother textin'
Ironically I think I get the message

[Break: Ashanti]
Hey
I haven't heard from you in a while
I just want to say
I just pray that you stay safe

[Hook: Belly & Ashanti]
Layin' in this bed I don't even sleep
Summer come around we don't even speak
Say you goin' away I don't even reach ya
Seven day love got me feelin' weak
Oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord


[Outro]
To answer your life goals before anything else
I love you

[Hook: Belly & Ashanti]
Layin' in this bed I don't even sleep
Summer come around we don't even speak
Say you goin' away I don't even reach ya
Seven day love got me feelin' weak
Oh lord
Oh lord, oh lord, oh lord
Oh lord
