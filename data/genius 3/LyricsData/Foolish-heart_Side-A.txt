I need a love that grows
I don't want it unless I know
But with each passin hour
Someone, somehow
Will be there, ready to share
I need a love that's strong
I'm so tired of being alone
But will my lonely heart
Play the part
Of the fool again, before I begin
Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore
I'm feelin that feelin again
I've been playin a game I can't win
Love's knockin on the door
Of my heart once more
Think I'll let him in
Before I begin
Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before, you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore
Foolish heart
Foolish, foolish heart
You've been wrong before
Foolish heart, hear me calling
Stop before you start falling
Foolish heart, heed my warning
You've been wrong before
Don't be wrong anymore
Foolish heart
Oh foolish
Foolish heart
You've been wrong before
Foolish
Foolish heart
Foolish heart
