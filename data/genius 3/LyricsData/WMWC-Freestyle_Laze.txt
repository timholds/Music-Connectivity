1994 and Sye can't beat box
I don't care 'cause, yo, I got on clean socks
'Cause my girl behind me washed 'em today
And um, it's 10:42 that's all I gotta' say
Matt Sutter sitting in the back of the room (hi)
With the cigarette smoking that boom
But that doesn't really pertain
To what I'm saying, I'm just sort of like, um, playing
The fattest new tracks that I've heard
Since I've came in here and so I gots to say um
Word.  Yeah, that's the word, that's the word
Um, word word word, word is the word
So, we gonna' close it out a little something like this
And talk for a little longer
