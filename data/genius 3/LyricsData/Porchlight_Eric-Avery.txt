So scared your life will end
You won’t let it begin
Your go away is here to stay
You peel your skin away
Dipped in salt you say
“I’ll never let ‘em have me, no way”

Porchlight
You pray while I say
I hope she hears you
You pray while I say I hope

No matter how it sounds
You ring the rusty bell
You never had to hear it yourself
With your head on the ground
Listen for distant sound
You just hear the pounding in your ear

Porchlight
You pray while I say
I hope she hears you
You pray while I say I hope
You pray while I say
I hope he hears you
You pray while I say I hope

Put up on the shelf
All that belong away
Let a seed become a day
I know you don’t know the way
You don’t pretend a way
The best thing for your boy is you let him hurt
