Take the ribbon from your hair, shake it loose and let it fall
Lay it soft against you skin, like the shadows on the wall
Come and lay down by my side till the early mornin' light
All I'm takin' is your time, help me make it through the night

I don't care what's right or wrong and I won't try to understand
Let the devil take tomorrow, for tonight I need a friend

Yesterday is dead and gone and tomorrow's out of sight
It's so sad to be alone, help me make it through the night
It's so sad to be alone, help me make it through the night

Lead me through the night
Take me through the night
Help me through the night
