[Verse 1]
That burning sunset in the sky
Is calling out to us tonight
I won't work for my old man
Anymore that you fit into your mammas plan
There's a place for people like you and me
True love's still got room to breathe

[Chorus 1]
And we can drive all night
Into the morning light
Let's go west
It's our ticket out of here
Yeah we can disappear
Let's go west
And that painted sky was made for us
It's everything we ever dreamed of
Let's go west

[Verse 2]
It's hard to leave this place behind
Got memories turning in my mind
Little white house with a picket fence
That protected small town innocence
But it seems like an even trade to me
That security for our destiny

[Chorus 2]
Yeah we can drive all night
Till the morning light
Let's go west
A place that we can go
Where the tall dreams grow
Let's go west
And we'll find a place to call our own
There's somewhere out there we belong
Let's go west

[Bridge]
And that painted sky was made for us
It's everything we ever dreamed of

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
Yeah let's go west
Oh let's go west
Oh let's go west
Yeah let's go west
