[Chorus:]
I don’t give a damn a
I don't, I don’t give a damn aboutx2
I don’t give a damn about
Nothing else
After this jam
I really don’t give a damn
[repeat x2]

[Verse 1:][Dynasty]
After this I really don’t give a damn
Who you want me to be
Or who you think I am
I’m what you get
When you go digging for realness
You gotta dig real deep
To get to this
I’m everything that these broads wanna be
But they scared to admit it
Because I’m so different
So they like to pretend
They don’t get it
I break every mold
I don’t fit it
My destiny written
I was born in NY
In the Spring
Q Borough
So you know I’m thorough
When I bring
Flows so passionate
I wish I could sing
These dudes on the radio
Ain’t rappin bout a thing
Don’t hear nothing else
At least hear this
Number 1 sound
So don’t you dare test
I got a big flow
And I’m so fearless
What you got going on
I could really care less
Because

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:][Eternia]
It go
I don’t really give a…
30 times 6 days
Since I spit and written
I’ve been given new direction
God’s business
So I listen
He plants the gift within me
He can take it in an instant
Believe that my bredrin
I could use distressing
Take a breather
Live life
Pause for a second
Smell the roses
Get some rest in
I’m confessin
Sometimes I don’t feel it when I’m spittin
I used to feel the spirit
But the business got me livid
I was steady climbing
But the climax was missing
And this misplaced priority
Of rap over living
I’m not gonna say it on every track
Really
So let me break it down for you one time
Simply
I don’t give a damn about the name game
I am not inspired by the fame
Or the dividends made
Put the pen to the page
When I move to create
When I got something to stay
But until that day
Hey yo

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:][Sara Kana]
Listen
You really, truly think
That I could give a fuck
About the records you sold
Shorty, you suck
You really, truly think
That I give a shit
If you get sluts tits
If you really move the brick
Bitch please
Pull your balls up
And act like a man
Don’t care about your followers, views or your fans
Your a stan
Impersonating other stans
Everybody rap these days
To insult the fans
Me, be gangsta to death
Hennessy flow
Put the burbs to yo chest
Taking birds from the nest
You’re a fraud in the flesh
It’s so hard, you upset
Bring your marketing bitch
It is what is isn’t
The glamour and gimmicks
You with it for image
But it’s gone when you pivot
Wake up pimpin’
Not tryna be mean
But grown men in skinny jeans
Is not my scene

[Chorus]
