Have I told you lately that I love you

Well if I didn't darlin' I'm sorry
Did I reach out and hold you in my loving arms, when you needed me
Now I realize that you need love, too, and I'll spend my life makin' up to you
Oh, I forgot to be your lover, and I'm sorry, I'm so sorry

First it was Pac and then Big, I know you feelin' me kid
It had me trippin' and I'm thinkin' what kind of joke that it is
And then when Pun died it made me think of his kids
And it bring the tears to my eyes when I see these babies cry
And can't forget the Eazy, and you then know that it's fo-sheezy
Got no time for flossin' when these soldiers out here need me
And them Gravediggas, and while chasin' major figures
But the things we say are seeds that we planted, they gettin' with us

Chorus
Now I realize that you need love to
And I'll spend my life makin' up tp you

Consumed by the things of this world
And never respectin' our girls
We callin' them hoes when they diamonds and pearls
And then they miss Aaliyah, so many out here wanna be her
Don't even know when the next time and when they really gonna see her
And we forgot about Him, unless we use Him in vain
And all these evil speekin' lyrics disrespectin' His name
These rappers sayin' nothin', that's why he tryin' to tell us something
While we kickin' rhymes, I see Him steady showin' signs
No more popin' pills, watchin' these young ones livin' ill
You glamorize the wicked, that's the kind of stupid that's gettin' us killed

Chorus

They drivin' Escalades, and Benz' and Lexus' and Jaguars
They rollin' on 22's with DVDs in they cars
Everyday on MTV and so they know who you are
Plus the way you live your life is like a movie star
They popin' Xs in the Lexus' Fine firls with diamond neckless'
Talkin' about how good the sexs is
And Pops gotta cry 'cuz we lost our Left-Eye
But behind the tragedy there's a reason why

Chorus
