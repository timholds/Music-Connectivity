Love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

There's nothing you can do which can't be done
There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say
But you can learn to play the game
It's easy

There's nothing you can make that can't be made
No-one you can save that can't be saved
Nothing you can do
Which you can learn how to do in time
It's easy

CHORUS
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
Love is all you need

(GUITAR SOLO)

CHORUS

There's nothing you can know that isn't known
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
Nowhere you can be
Which isn't where your meant to be
It's easy

CHORUS X2

Love is all you need (keep repeating until end of song)
