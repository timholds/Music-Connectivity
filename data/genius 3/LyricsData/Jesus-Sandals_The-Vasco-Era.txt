Throw out your old definitions babe
This bird's song will never sound the same
Walking the dismal mists I heard her sing her last song
It was called 'oh my god is it night time again'
She looked to me and said:
'No I don't want your baby I want a regal sounding name
Lost in a shopping centre looking for anyone at all that can make the world change
Cause baby I am no candidate for that.'
Just before that bird had flown
I heard her talking about the rhythm of words
I heard her take the hypocritic oath
And then walk right up to me with a placebo pill
She looked to me and said:
'No I don't want your baby I want a regal sounding name
Lost in a shopping centre looking for anyone at all that can make the world change
Cause baby I am no candidate for that.'
Oh is she coming back
Oh when the sun is down
Oh covered in avalanche
Oh covered in shoppers' stains
Now I know that I'm made mostly of water
And I can see you're wearing jesus sandals
But that don't mean that you can walk over me
While filling yourself up on your converted wine
She looked to me and said:
'No I don't want your baby I want a regal sounding name
Lost in a shopping centre looking for anyone at all that can make the world change
Cause baby I am no candidate for that.'
