[Verse 1: Bashy]
Oy, cuz they've got me (what?)
They caught me slipping up in Totty (where?)
I jumped out the ride, I ran in the KFC and they must've clocked me (ughh)
Come outside see bare man on me
I asked them, what's man on there? (Yeah)
Then the tall one showed me the shotty (cha)
And I ain't stupid...
Chantel was in the coupe and got away
They told me I best co-operate
I was like rude-bwoy later, he was like, 'Pussyhole not today
I'll blow your top away'
Then I jumped in the van, held couple bangs
They gave me the phone and told me ring up your man

[Hook: Scorcher]
Ay, Listen if you want your friend back it's best you find a ten stack
I always see you in them raves, with them chains and the best champs
Yeah I know you've got money, real talk dog I know you've got money
