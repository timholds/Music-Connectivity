[Verse 1: Scorcher]
Yeah, it used to be plenty of cooked food
Nice smile and a good mood, now it ain't either
When I'm like "give me a massage" she ain't too eager
She tells me her hands hurt
She used to help me with the bagging up when I was dealing with grams' work
But now she ain't interested
She tells me I've got Ps and have to invest it
Like I ain't got a brain in my head
But she ain't the same in the bed
She ain't slacking but the underwear ain't matching
And when I'm on top, she goes hard with the scratching
And leaves teeth marks on my neck as a mark of respect
But it was always like this
She used to love this, I used to like this
Now I'm more like "how the fuck did I wife this?"
This ain't how it used to be

[Hook: Ghetts]
Let's get back to the way things were
I'm fed up of the arguments
From my get up, it's an argument
Truthfully, this ain't how it used to be
Let's get back to the way things were
I'm fed up of the arguments
From my get up, it's an argument
Truthfully, you just ain't how you used to be

[Verse 2: Mercston]
It used to seem so right
When we spent time together
Everything seemed alright
We used to lay down and snuggle up closely at night
But them things changed
I feel saying it was your female friends
Telling you that I still play games
And that I wouldn't ever change
They claim that I'm out for the
Paper and fame, but it's bullshit, I swear
I think back to the times when you would wake
Up in the morning, yawning
Look deep in my eyes, telling me you're falling
Deeper in love, and that the past wouldn't
Ever have an effect on us
So why does it feel like we're drifting
Further apart? We ain't nothing like the start, look

[Hook: Ghetts]
Let's get back to the way things were
I'm fed up of the arguments
From my get up, it's an argument
Truthfully, this ain't how it used to be
Let's get back to the way things were
I'm fed up of the arguments
From my get up, it's an argument
Truthfully, you just ain't how you used to be

[Verse 3: Wretch 32]
Revish to the present
You was in need of my presence
I was feeling the effort you put in
Then for no relevant reason
Jealousy steamed in your attitude, reaped out, bleaching
Our atriums didn't attract but collapsed, in fact
We fell out of love like "I hate you, jinx"
We brought the chain of events
But we get new links, yeah
Breakfast in bed turned to muesli
Muesli swung from usual to usually
You soon come from half six to past three
Now you don't wanna ask or tell me
Everything, anything, I'm lusting
Like one thing, something, pumpkin
You're taking the biscuit, babe
And you're making a big mistake

[Hook: Ghetts]
Let's get back to the way things were
I'm fed up of the arguments
From my get up, it's an argument
Truthfully, this ain't how it used to be
Let's get back to the way things were
I'm fed up of the arguments
From my get up, it's an argument
Truthfully, you just ain't how you used to be
