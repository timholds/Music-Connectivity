[Verse 1]
Knock, knock, guess who's at your front door
It's Kasland in a fashion that will make them want more
Waiting for the perfect time to hit the road up on tour
And let this whole entire nation find out what I've come for
See I'm ripping it a bit different
Take the weight of this shit start lifting it
So gifted and I'm slipping in
The window with a fully loaded clip and shit
I'm mister ehh don't talk of that
I'm pissed that it won't shift a cent
So listen with an open mind
This shit don't stink get a whiff of it
Don't get mad I'm hoping that
One day this shit will show me back
To the ropes and crap when I overlap
Take another can of whoop ass open that
I'm broke and happen to be
The reason Nickelodeon just says no to rap
But I'm over that, ok no I'm not
Nickelodeon don't you hold me back
Woah was that what I think it was
Another shot down I need to stop drinking cause
Every time I do I speak and fuss
Had a couple Beam and cokes now I think I'm buzzed
I'm weak and plus I'm a little on edge
But I guess that's just what the weekend does
Then I came up slow, became the most hated rapper
In the underground and the reason was

[Hook]
I cover left, I cover right
A cause of stress, not one in sight
I clench my fists, prepare to fight
I'm coming in overnight and then I breach and
Clear, bust these doors down I'm in, they don't want me
Near cause I'm coming for the win, and then I breach and
Clear feel the changing of the wind, nothing left to
Fear just a matter now of when, it's time to breach and clear

[Verse 2]
Clear my mind of every little thing
That kept me from going and pursuing my dream
And push things forward, keep doing my thing
Until the fans go nuts as soon as I'm seen
Been stuck in the dark for so damn long
That I started contemplating suicide see
I say I'm ok, but I could be psycho
So which one is it? You decide G
It seems these days little underground
Rappers try so hard to be just like me
They change their hair and the way they dress
This could be the beginning of what might be
The new generation of a problem from the year
Two thousand and why it's hard to come by me
So will the real Kasland please stand up
As I stomp on all the fake ones I see
It's my uprising so hop on board
Or be left behind, the choice is yours
Been screaming out my pain on this mic for years
So pardon me y'all if my voice is hoarse
If no one pays attention this time around
Then Imma keep making noise of course
And if you don't like it then you can eat shit
And then go commit Rolls Royce's doors
Boys and whores it's about that time
To show the whole damn world that I'm out my mind
Call TMZ, introduce myself
Say we're about to get to know each other now that I'm
Coming up in the game spitting so damn raw
All these people want to know is how did I find
The time to develop all of my skills
Then turn it into something that could sound that fine

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Pass out at night, get wild, and wake up
In a strange place the following morning and discuss this
Blackout problem that I'm having with my doc
After last being seen late boarding a bus with
A bunch of groupie girls trying to get with me
But y'all are all too damn boring to touch this
So back to my cell, flip my manager off
As I crawl in bed with Victoria Justice
I do what I want, don't tuck my tail
Stay real and be me no matter what I sell
If I ever start slipping, end up in jail
Keep some money on the side just to front my bail
This rap is all I know, give me one mic, nail
This track so ready up Imma come by hail
Gave it all my focus and walked out of school
Screaming I don't really give a flying fuck, I fail

[Hook]
