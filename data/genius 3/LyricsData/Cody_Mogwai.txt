[Intro]
Of all I knew, I held too few
And would you stop me, if I tried to stop you?

[Chorus]
Old songs stay till the end
Sad songs remind me of friends
And the way it is, I could leave it all
And I ask myself, would you care at all?

[Bridge]
When I drive alone at nights, I see the streetlights as fairgrounds
And I tried a hundred times to see the road signs as Day-Glo

[Chorus]
Old songs stay till the end
Sad songs remind me of friends
And the way it is, I could leave it all
And I ask myself, would you care at all?

Old songs stay till the end
Sad songs remind me of friends
And the way it is, I could leave it all
And I ask myself, would you care at all?
