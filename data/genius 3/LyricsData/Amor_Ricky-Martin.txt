[Verse 1]
Amor, only in a dream
I ever thought you'd find me
Amor, fell into a kiss
And left the world behind me
Wasy to believe my lies
And never know it
Easier to throw it away
Now i look into her eyes
And i can see it
I know the reasin ti stay
Although they say

[Chorus]
Deja, deja
Cuidado que te quema
They'll say it over again
Amor te quema
Pero, deja
Lo hago por ella
I'd do it over again
Solo por ella

[Verse 2]
Amor, never was a touch
Enough to just persuade me
Amor, now that i can feel my heart
My thoughts evade me
Easy to believe my lies
And never know it
Easier to throw it away
Now i look into her eyes
And i can see it
I know the reason to stay
Although they say

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Easy to believe my lies
And never know it
Wasier to throw it away
Now i look into her eyes
And i can see it
I know the reason to stay
Although they say

[Chorus]
