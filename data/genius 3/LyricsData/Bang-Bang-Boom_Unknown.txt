Its like a disco in the sky
We watch the fireworks spill in our eyes
Its like a world without a war
A pyromaniac beggin' for more

I've got an army in my head
My bullet brains and I'm better off dead
I've got a cyclone in my soul
My hearts bleeding into a big, black hole
BANG
Sayonara
BANG
Nice to know ya
BANG
Say good bye
BANG BANG BOOM
