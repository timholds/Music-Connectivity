[Verse 1]
Arnold Layne had a strange hobby
Collecting clothes
Moonshine washing line
They suit him fine
On the wall hung a tall mirror
Distorted view, see through baby blue
He done it

[Chorus]
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne

[Verse 2]
Now he's caught - a nasty sort of person
They gave him time
Doors bang, chain gang
He hates it

[Chorus]
Oh, Arnold Layne
It's not the same, takes two to know
Two to know, two to know
Two to know
Why can't you see?
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Arnold Layne
Don't do it again
