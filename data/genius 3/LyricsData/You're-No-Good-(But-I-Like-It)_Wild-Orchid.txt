Don't worry about me, don't worry about you
'Cause everything you do, boy, I've done, too
Don't worry about me, don't worry about you
'Cause everything you do, boy, I've done, too

A little bit of heaven, and a little bit of hell
You know the words to say, and you say it well
I know your little secret, I know your little lie
So go on, tell me, I'll believe your alibi

You set the stage and you're playing a part
But I've always known who you really are
(So intellectual)

No good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good, but I like it, like it

A little bit of torture, a little bit of peace
And your demeanor covers your real need
I hear your little whisper, I hear your little sigh
But are you bored with all those social butterflies

I'll give my life, just lay in the dark
'Cause I've always known who you really are
(So intellectual)

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good, but I like it, like it

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good, but I like it

I know it's wrong, it feels so right
This candle burns without a light
The fire feeds my hunger for your open door
(And just a little more)

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

I'm gonna say it again
You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
(Don't worry about me, don't worry about you)
('Cause everything you do, boy, I've done, too)

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
(Don't worry about me, don't worry about you)
('Cause everything you do, boy, I've done, too)

You're no good
You're no good
You're no good
Baby, you're no good
