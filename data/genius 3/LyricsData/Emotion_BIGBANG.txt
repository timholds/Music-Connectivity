Kiken na peesu wakattete I cannot stop
Kimi no ruru midashite fool burning love higher
Kokoro ga mugen no shout manazashi de
I wanna touch I wanna kiss I wish with you

Oh oh oh ubaitai just you just now
Come baby come baby come
Oh oh oh ima janakya right here right now

It's already in motion bokura mou
Tashikani koi ni ochiteru
It's in motion it's emotion
Kanjiru mama dakishimete

Jikan wa mou already many juubun sugiru
Look at my eyes kimi dake ga sokoni iru
Risou to lie aitte why? Mado waseta?
Faker na guys to wa chigau I'm your destiny

Oh oh oh mayowazu ni choose me just now
Come baby come come baby
Oh oh oh ima sugu ni kiss me right now

It's already in motion kimidatte mou
Tashikani hora motometeru
It's in motion it's emotion
Ai no tobira wo mitometeru it's in motion

Ya that's the way you make me say girl it's you that I want
Everyday we no delay gotta have you in my arms
I just can't hold back and see what you be doing be killing me
Bringing inside and need you like the air I breathe

Utagattecha nothing know me kono ai mo
Take my hands follow me tashikameni yukou

It's already in motion bokura mou
Tashikani koi ni ochiteru
It's already in motion it's emotion
Kanjiru mama dakeshimete
It's already in motion kimidatte mou
Tashika ni hora motometeru
It's in motion it's emotion
Ai no tobira wo mitometeru it's in motion

It's in motion
