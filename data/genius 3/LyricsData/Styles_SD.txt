She like my style she like my stelo She like the way I talk she said she like my ego
Girl tell me whats your style
And do I fit your perfect smile

[Verse 1: SD]
Girl whats your style?
Girl why not mingle?
You ain't too very shy well hey girl nice to meet you
Just me see you smile
I got a feeling I'm your style
We could be friends or we could be cool but I really know deep down you into me too
Just let me lay you down I ain't afraid I'll hold ya down
You unsecure girl they beneath you
You know I'm here with you girl fuck them other people
We can go some rounds
We might just take this shit around all around

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SD]
I know you wild but I forgive you
And don't you ever think I go against you
I ain't the type to make you frown
We ain't to sure but I believe you
And I'll say anything to keep you out them peepholes
Girl I'll replace the clowns don't be no fool and stick around
I got your back like you stay lethel
Girl we gone ride or die and I'm gone be your hero
Girl just to see you smile
I got a feeling I'm your style your style
