Don't send me no kind of letter
I don't want you calling on the telephone
Please don't send me no kind of letter baby
I don't want you calling on the telephon
I Want you person to person
Get your fine self on back home

Don't you bother telephoning
I can't love no telephone
The time you used for phoning
You could have used that time comin' home
I Want you person to person
Get your fine self on back home

Well I don't want no kind of letter
I can't hold no paper tight
There ain't no kind of message
Gonna sit up and talk to me all night
I Want you person to person
Get your fine self on back home

Ah, lemme make a call ...
I hear it ringing ...
Kind a sounds like station to station ...
I want person to person ...
Get me the connection
I want you person to person, baby
Get your fine self on back home
