[Verse 1]
What brings you around?
Did you lose something the last time you were here?
You'll never find it now
It's buried deep with your identity

[Pre-Chorus]
So stand aside and let the next one pass
Don't let the door kick you in the ass

[Chorus]
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There’s no return from 86
Don't even try

[Verse 2]
Exit out the back
And never show your head around again
Purchase your ticket
And quickly take the last train out of town

[Pre-Chorus]
So stand aside and let the next one pass
Don't let the door kick you in the ass

[Chorus]
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There’s no return from 86
Don't even try

[Chorus]
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There's no return from 86
There’s no return from 86
Don't even try
