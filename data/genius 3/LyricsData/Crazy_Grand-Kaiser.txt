[Intro: Theory]
They ain't with it eh
They ain't with it uh
That's your bitch, bet I hit it eh
They ain't with it eh
They ain't with it uh
That's your bitch, bet I hit it eh

[Verse 1: Theory]
I been riding round that low
Right, and bitches giving me ghosts
Ride a hot head that's super dome
No Reggie bush that's only Kush
I stay screwed like Houston flow
She high and bi, I hi and bye
I'm somebody you used to know
Topless cars, ruthless hoes
But I been sipping right, I been popping right
I got a couple dollars in my wallet and my pocket right
Yeah, talking vodka straight
Oh oh let's do it, No Waka Flocka Flame
Swimming pool full of liquor then you dive in it, drown in it
Room full of bitches then you vibe in it, lounge in it
Tomb full of gold, you resting impressed with it
Mouth full of diamonds, fuck you I'm the best with it

[Hook: Rino]
Bitch, you know I'm crazy
Fucked up, my mind's hazy
Stupid disses, don't faze me
Presidential, you can't trace me
Bitch, you know I'm crazy
Fucked up, my mind's hazy
Stupid disses, don't faze me
Presidential, you can't trace me

[Verse 2: Grand Kaiser]
I get it, I live it, your bitch is, so with it
Put my team on like a fitted, now on you is where we're shitting
Cooking that white at my old crib, sell that work heavy doses
These salty ass haters just posers, and I be on street where the dope is
Let's go bitch, I'm going hard, I'm so rich and I love my job
All I do is break the law got raps stuffed underneath my jaw
Tell me singles flopping funny cos I'm the God bitch
Anybody who know me will tell you GK on his boss shit
That God shit, I'm all in, I got the pen, I'm 'bout to win
Got your bitch gonna bring her friend
Got more class than when the summer end
Smoking weed on the street screaming fuck the Feds
Can't kick it with me you might break your leg
No other senseis just me and KIN, broke dudes around me that shit's a sin
Adjectives, I'm living rich, you's a bitch, you's a dick
Settling all my loose ends let's get this money I choose to win
I rule the land, got master plans, I destroyed your world conquered the next
You told people I was not the best, now I'm bout to put all your fibs to rest
