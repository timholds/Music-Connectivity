You are my best friend
You been right here through thick and thin
You are my best friend
Gotten me through places I've been
You are my best friend
Through our situations
You have been my inspiration
My best friend
You're still here and I love you

I think you got angel wings
Hiding up under there somewhere
Michelle, my belle
Dunno where we would be if we never met you girl
I love you, I thank you
You such a blessing
I am so grateful
I truly believe the Lord sent you to me and Kelly
The smile the laughter always makes me happy
When I am too serious or too intense
With a voice that beautiful you was heaven sent

My sister my life couldn't be better
Doing what I love with my best friend
And making Cheddar Kelly
The most beautifulest girl in the world
You are my survivor and I admire you
You have no idea how special you are
Humble, talented and blessed you are
Sometimes I wish I could be more like you
Sometimes they don't wanna give your credit to you
Wouldn't be a Destiny's Child if it wasn't for you
DC-3 forever I'm thanking you

Lord thank you for your vision that we see down here on earth
Thank you for your precious gifts
Your sweet precious gift of love
Through everything can no one come between
Us three

Michelle, ah
Ain't it funny?
God always knows what he is doing
And he showed me some of that when you came
Into me and bey's life
And just let us know that we can count on you
And actually stay with a relaxed heart
Together we are sisters
Your smile has so much meaning so much life
You are the perfect fit
What more could we ask for?
We got Michelle
Your voice is like water
Your voice is like rain
And the world ain't ready for you
I love you and I will always be here for you

Beyonce, we have come so far together
And it feels so good to have travelled
Half the road of life with an angel
Walking and learning and teaching you the whole time
God is so awesome
And I thank him for answering my prayers as a child
I never told you this, but I prayed for
A lifelong friend as a child
And God just has his way of sending precious treasures
And I found mine
Everyday our relationship gets stronger
And I love you for the
Loyal, unselfish, generous, gifted, wise and beautiful
Person you are
No one absolutely no one can take that away from us
You are the definition of a true friend

B and Kelly you two mean so much to me
Only God knew that this union was meant to be
Only God knew all the things we couldn't see
But if we pray together
We'll stay together

Beyonce and Kelly
You both exemplify coming from my eyes
What love is
"Love is patient" Beyonce that's what you've been
"Love is kind" Miss Kelly, that's what you have shown
"It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud, it is not rude
It is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered
It keeps no record of wrong
Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth
It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres"
First Corinthians 13, four through seven
