[Verse 1]
My friend drove off the other day
Now he's gone and all they say
Is "you got to live cause life goes on..."
But now I see I'm mortal, too
I can't live my life like you
Got to live it up while life goes on

[Chorus]
And I think it's all right
That I do what I like
Cause that's the way I want to live
It's how I give, and I'm still givin'...

[Verse 2]
And now I wonder 'bout my friend
If he gave all he could give
Cause he lived his life like I live mine
If you could see inside my head
Then you'd start to understand
The things I value in my heart

[Chorus]
And I think it's all right
That I do what I like
Cause that's the way I want to live
It's how I give, and I'm still givin'...

[Bridge]
You know that...
I know that...
You're watchin' me!

[Chorus]
And I think it's all right
That I do what I like
Cause that's the way I want to live
It's how I give, and I'm still givin'...

[Outro]
Got to make a plan, got to do what's right
Can't run around in circles if you wanna build a life
But I don't want to make a plan for a day far away
While I'm young and while I'm able, all I want to do is...
