[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Now you've been holding me down for such a long time now
From back then till now, in my story
Straight from the hood, you've always been there for me
And you had my back when they
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything
It was you who kept me holding on
No matter what was going on
So no whatever you need, I got you, yeah

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
Reminiscing that 6 train from way back
Now it's sky blue phantoms and stretch Maybachs
From sweeping them floors in them Bronx apartments
"Mira, esta que on that red carpet"
When Pun died, you was the first to call me
I never told you but you was there for me
Whatever you need, I'll be there for you
Crack, I got your back for real, true story

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Now my loyalty, will always be with you
If you just promise me that you'll stay real, just like you are
Cause baby, you don't have to change, no

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Fat Joe] (2x)
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you down, you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, boy, I'm gon' hold you down
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you down, you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, girl, I'm gon' hold you down

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
2005 Rakim and Jody Watley
Watch me paint a picture so perfect, quite possibly
The realest, fresher from BX to South Beach
I'ma always hold you down, girl, you can count on me

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez]
So remember this whenever I call
We go back too far, we've been through it all
Even though we haven't spoke in so long
Ain't nothing changed, not a damn thing, baby!

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Now my loyalty, will always be with you
If you just promise me that you'll stay real, just like you are
Cause baby, you don't have to change, no

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Fat Joe] (2x)
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you down, you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, boy, I'm gon' hold you down
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you down, you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, girl, I'm gon' hold you down

[Verse 5: Fat Joe]
Like green is to autumn, some things must stay
This industry, yeah, I fought 'em, made me this way
Get between me and J. Lo, I simply state
You're better off sweeping leaves on a windy day, no

[Bridge: Jennifer Lopez]
So I don't care about the situation
I'ma ride for you if there's a complication
Cause every time you had my back and all
When we were young, now you Joey Crack and all

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Now my loyalty, will always be with you
If you just promise me that you'll stay real, just like you are
Cause baby, you don't have to change, no

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez & Fat Joe] (2x)
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you down, you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, boy, I'm gon' hold you down
You don't know how much you mean to me
Whenever you down, you know that you can lean on me
No matter the situation, girl, I'm gon' hold you down
