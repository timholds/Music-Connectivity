Call me
You don't need me
But I like you
And I wouldn't mind
If you'd call me
Driving me crazy
Cause I'm crazy
And easy to drive
I know that I will get nervous
Around you
And thrilled by the way you do
The things you do
The way you step on
The accelerator
Or let your cat out at night
You could do the least
Impressive thing
Call me
You don't need me
But I like you
And I don't mind
All the others
I can make you
Love me more
Than you ever loved anyone before
All I need is a bit
Of your precious time
Probably won't ever happen but
I dream on in my mind
Your foot will step on the accelerator
And let your cat out at night
You could do the least impressive thing
Call me
You're above me
You don't have to
But i don't mind
You're gonna call me
If I'm only thinking hard enough
You can't deny
Gonna wear the same
Thing you liked last time
Walk along the curb and
Not stepping on any lines
Step on the accelerator baby
Let your cat out for the night
Do the least impressive thing and
Call me
You don't need me
But I like you
And I don't mind
If you'd call me
Driving me crazy
Cause I'm crazy
And easy to drive
Call me...
