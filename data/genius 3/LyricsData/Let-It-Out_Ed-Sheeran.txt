[Verse 1]
You give me life and a loss of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight, tight enough to know
That you are mine, I'd never let you go

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's you I miss
And it's you I miss

[Chorus]
So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

[Verse 2]
And you speak to me behind your darkened stare
And you let me be as if I wasn't there

[Refrain]
It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Not another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

[Pre-Chorus]
It's you I miss
And it's you I miss

[Chorus]
So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

[Refrain]
It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Not another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue

[Interlude]
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue

[Chorus]
So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

[Refrain]
It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Not another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue
