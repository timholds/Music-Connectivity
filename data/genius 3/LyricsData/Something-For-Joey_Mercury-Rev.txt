Crash land in an obscene movie
And find yourself on an outstretched finger
A p/massive heart as a massive hole
You see faces that you did not know
It's exact their (little?) stinger's intact
They're designed (they decide?) to rule (rue?) the day (warmer days?)
Their mouths are moving a million miles an hour
It's the only way, hey
You're seeing illusions (I've seen the legions?) in this house
The things we never talk about
So place your lips around the (his?) spout
And slowly blow yourself away
