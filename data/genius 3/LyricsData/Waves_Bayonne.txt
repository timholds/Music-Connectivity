[Verse 1]
And I know there's something else
Something else, something else
And I know
That you'd be there for me

And now that you're somewhere else
Somewhere else, somewhere else
I might find
Less reason to be
I hear it now

[Verse 2]
And now that I'm by myself
By myself, by myself
You could see
That I'm healing my needs

And you reach that someone else
Someone else, someone else
You can throw
This under your feet
I see it now

[Verse 3]
And I know there's something else
Something else, something else
And you'd rather not hear it from me
I see it now

And I know there's something else
Something else, something else
And you'd rather not hear it from me
I see it now
