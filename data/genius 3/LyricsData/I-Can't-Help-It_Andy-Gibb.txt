Oh, I , baby what a fool I am
First a boy and then a man , am I
And you , you're the heart of it all
You're the things I say and do
Am I wasting my time , hangin' around
You would be gone

But I can't help it
Ev'ry moment that I think about you
Ev'ry day and ev'ry night without you
I can't survive
Love , take away the lonely days gone by
Make it ev'ry day for you and I
Givin' me the chance to go on believin'
Girl , you gotta go on believin'
(Boy), you gotta go on believin'

You , baby you're the breath I take
Coming for a heart in love , am I
And you , you're the heart of it all
You're the things I say and do
Am I wasting my time , hangin' around
You would be gone

But I can't help it
Ev'ry moment that I think about you
Ev'ry day and ev'ry night without you
I can't survive
Love , take away the lonely days gone by
Make it ev'ry day for you and I
Givin' me the chance to go on believin'
Girl , you gotta go on believin'
(Boy) , you gotta go on believin'

La.....

I can't help it
Ev'ry moment that I think about you
Ev'ry day and ev'ry night , I can't survive
Love , take away the lonely days gone by
Make it ev'ry day for you and I
Giving me a chance to , help it , help it
Ev'ry moment that I think about you
Ev'ry day and night I can't survive
Love , take away the lonely days gone by
