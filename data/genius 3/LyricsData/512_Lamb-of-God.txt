[Verse 1]
Six bars laid across the sky
Four empty walls to fill the time
One careless word, you lose your life
A grave new world awaits inside

[Verse 2]
Lycanthropic survival instincts
Embrace the beast and shun the weak
Awake the primal one that sleeps inside
Or feel the shiv(er) running through your spine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The time is slipping by no peace in sight
But the teeth of time still hold their bite

[Chorus]
My hands are painted red
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself
I've become someone else
My hands are painted red
My hands are painted red

[Verse 3]
Schizophrenic amnesia
Bid goodbye to all you knew and loved
Forget the only life that you knew outside
They bought the ticket, now you take the ride

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The time is slipping by no peace in sight
But the teeth of time still hold their bite

[Chorus]
My hands are painted red
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself
I've become someone else
My hands are painted red
My hands are painted red

[Bridge]
Another number quickly learns the rules
A hidden burner waits to point at you
A subtle gesture and you're ventilated
Talk isn't cheap here, bleed out in payment

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Six bars laid across the sky
Four empty walls to fill the time

[Chorus]
My hands are painted red
My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself
I've become someone else
My hands are painted red
My hands are painted red

My future's painted black
I can't recognize myself
I've become someone else
My hands are painted red
My hands are painted red
