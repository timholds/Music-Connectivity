[Intro]
I just want to be... I just want to be

[Verse 1]
Taking away
The fact that I care about you
It's just your way, so sweet
Everything seems right around you
Did you know
That you have this calming way about you
In your touch
And I want to know if I could be your girl

[Chorus]
You are everything
And everything is you ( your girl )
You are everything
And everything is you ( your girl )
You are everything
And everything is you ( your girl )
You are everything
And everything is you

[Verse 2]
I'm happy to say
In a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile
When you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishing away
Any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows
I really feel, I'll always be your girl

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
The one who puts her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else sees, I can see it ( your girl )
The one who knows when something's wrong
The one who knows your favourite song ( your girl )
The one who all your family loves
The one you place no one above

[Chorus]


I'll always be, your girl

[Hook] [x4]
The one who's true to you, and down for you
The one who makes you smile, and laughs with you
The one who holds you down, I'm there for you

[Outro]
I can be anything you need
