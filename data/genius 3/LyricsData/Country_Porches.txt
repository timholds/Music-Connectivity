[Verse 1]
When the air hit my face
And it smelled like the truth
I saw you in the lake
I saw you in the lake

[Verse 2]
I lay flat on the bed
Really cools me off
Keep it dumb make it soft
Keep it dumb make it soft

[Verse 3]
Watch the water drip
From my mouth to yours
I like how you take a sip
I like how you take a sip

[Verse 4]
Can you make it light
Can you do no harm
Break the water with your arms
Break the water with your arms
Break the water with your arms
Break the water with your arms
