As the new day breaks, I yearn for your mistakes
Therefore I am to reveal your master plan
To give is to die a thousand times
To live is to pay for your mortal crimes

Hang yourself to the nearest lie
For all you've done there's no salvation
As you bury your mother, we rape your mind
As you cry in your bleeding time

How much can you stand
For all the hate you give?
How much more will it take
For all the hate you give?

When all the promises shatter in your embrace
That is the reason for your destiny
To fly with the wings of tomorrow
To grief for the lost tomorrow

Hang yourself to the nearest lie
For all you've done there's no salvation
As you cry in your bleeding time
We rape your mind

How much can you stand
For all the hate you give?
How much more will it take
For all the hate you give?
