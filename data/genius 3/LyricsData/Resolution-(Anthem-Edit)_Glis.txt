Each day brings a brand new vision
So many miles so effortless
So nothing will ever change my decision
I will never expect anything less

Every time I ask for truth you tell me lies
Every time I want the answers you run and hide
Every time I ask for truth you tell me lies
Every time I want the answers you run and hide

Something seems to be getting closer
Something seems to be getting closer
We need a resolution

Something seems to be getting closer
Something seems to be getting closer
We need a resolution
We need a revolution

Something seems to be getting closer
And the day grows short again
And in my dreams I dreamt of ending
Crushing the life gripped in my hands

Every time I ask for truth you tell me lies
Every time I want the answers you run and hide
Every time I ask for truth you tell me lies
Every time I want the answers you run and hide

Something seems to be getting closer
Something seems to be getting closer
We need a resolution

So each day brings a brand new vision
So many miles so effortless
And nothing will ever change my decision
I will never expect anything less

Every time I ask for truth you tell me lies
Every time I want the answers you run and hide
Every time I ask for truth you tell me lies
Every time I want the answers you run and hide

Something seems to be getting closer
Something seems to be getting closer
We need a resolution
