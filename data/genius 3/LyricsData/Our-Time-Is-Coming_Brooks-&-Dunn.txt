[Verse 1]
Times are hard and the money's tight
Day to day we fight that fight
Nothing new, it's the same old grind
Uphill all the way
Boss man says forget the raise
Preacher says to keep the faith
Good things come to those who wait
Tomorrow's another day

[Chorus]
Our time is coming
When or where the good Lord only knows
Our time is coming
When this road we're on will turn to a street of gold

[Verse 2]
Long as we keep love alive
Something tells me we'll survive
It's the little things that'll get us by
And hold us together
I feel it when you hold me close
Baby we got more than most
Steady through the highs and lows
We'll go on forever

[Chorus]

[Outro]
When this road we're on will turn to a street of gold
