[Verse 1]
Two broken hearts lonely lookin' like houses
Where nobody lives
Two people each havin' so much pride inside
Neither side forgives

[Chorus]
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
It's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the number of husbands and wives

[Bridge]
A woman and a man, a man and a woman
Some can, some can't, some can't

[Verse 2]
Oh, two broken hearts lonely lookin' like houses
Where nobody lives
Two people each havin' so much pride inside
Neither side forgives

[Chorus]
The angry words spoken in haste
Such a waste of two lives
Oh, it's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the number of husbands and wives

[Outro]
Yeah, it's my belief pride is the chief cause in the decline
In the number of husbands and wives
