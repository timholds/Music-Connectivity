Nobody shall sleep!

Nobody shall sleep!
Even you, o Princess
In your cold room
Watch the stars
That tremble with love and with hope
But my secret is hidden within me
My name no one shall know

No!
No!

On your mouth I will tell it when the light shines
And my kiss will dissolve the silence that makes you mine!
(No one will know his name and we must, alas, die.)

Vanish, o night!
Set, stars! Set, stars!
At dawn, I will win! I will win! I will win!
