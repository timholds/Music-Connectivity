Writing down thoughts of grieving
While other people laugh and are singing
Here's another one for you to miss the meaning
Does that make sense or am I misleading?

I'd put myself out there
If I thought that you would care

Vague Descriptions of my feelings
Make perfect background music for staring at ceilings
Here's another one for you to miss meaning
And you wonder why I am always leaving

I'd put myself out there
If I thought that you would care

Pretend you can't hear me
I'll just keep on writing
