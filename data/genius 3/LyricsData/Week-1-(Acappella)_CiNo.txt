Yo, if Rap is my heart, then Hip-Hop's my soul
My veins are the chords to mix-AUX-record
I griplock control, this spot is owned
So sick of this hole, being pissed off and broke
I'm this close to schizo, the shit's not a joke
I'm kinda like a clock, cuz I'm tick-talkin' slow
So high, I assume if you trip, I'm the stone
Until I bend paper, I will not go fold
And if I said I'm in it, that don't mean for a minute
So omit it cuz I meant it, a minotaur, I'm a menace!
Many of these mothafuckas mention amendments
My opinion may mean that youz a miniature midget
Your flow is fickle, I then called you out, you shook and cried
I'm known to hit you if you talkin' loud, don't shuck and jive
Roll a spliff up, then I fog a cloud, like I took the sky
Stole a nickle from the slaughterhouse, then got a crooked eye!
