I told your best friend when she phoned that you were sleeping
I told the postman you went out shoppin' for some things
But tonight when I tried to tell the mirror that I don't love you
That's the biggest lie I had to face all day

I told the girl who does your hair that we were moving
I told the school yes you'd attend the PTA
But tonight when I tried to tell the mirror that I don't love you
That's the biggest lie I had to face all day

Now I'm puttin' on the whole town by saying you're still around
Everyone but me thinks everything's okay
When I say I don't love you I'm just trying to fool a fool
Cause that's the biggest lie I had to face all day
Yes that's the biggest lie I had to face all day
