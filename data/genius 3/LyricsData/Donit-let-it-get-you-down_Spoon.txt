Kay made it to where the most never been
Fixed up outside and broke within
She always said goodnight
Knowing the wrong from right
But on the way the top
They showed her things she never thought
And left her down in the dumps
All day and all of the night
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Kay grew up without making a sound
But skipped ahead to settled down
Aw, won't you come out tonight?
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
Don't let it get you down
