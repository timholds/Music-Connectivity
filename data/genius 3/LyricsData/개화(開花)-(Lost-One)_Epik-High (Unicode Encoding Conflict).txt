개화(開花) 의해 에픽하이 가사Hangul[Intro: Kim Jong Wan]
기억하나요?
좋았던 순간들이
먼지가 되어 쌓여가네요
실바람 한점에도
흩어질 것 같아
겁이 나네요
겁이 나네요

[Hook: Kim Jong Wan]
I’m a lost one
I’m a lost one
Everything I love makes me cry
Cuz I’m a lost one
Yeah I’m a lost one
All that I live for makes me die

[Verse 1: Tablo]
My child, when you follow
내가 밟은 길을 잘 봐둬
언젠가는 너의 옆에 걷지 못할 거야
여기 발자국을 남겨둬
보고 피해
편한 길을 택한 사람들을 따라가렴
그게 답이기에
물음표처럼 구부러진 내 길은
그저 무수한 문제만 낳기에
나를 보고 꿈꾸는
너의 그 꿈은
깨고 보니 악몽이 아니길
끝까지 달려 와보니
내가 찾던 영원, 치유, 답을 닮은 건 not a thing
이 길은 내가 달리던 이유였던 가족도 앗아가버렸어
어쩌면 출발을 알리던 총성은
내 등을 향한 거였어
잘 들어
온 세상이 너를 환영해도
그 세상이 너를 버릴 테니 gotta let go
늦기 전에
Cuz I’ve been there before
눈에 보이는 건 화려해도
Don’t be fooled by the diamonds and gold
갈채 쏟아질 때 취하지 마
때론 칭찬으로 너의 발을 묶을 거야
레드카펫 깔아줘도 잊지 마라
그게 너의 피땀으로 붉게 물든 거야
나를 보고 꿈꾸는
너의 그 꿈은
깨고 보니 악몽이 아니길
끝까지 달려 와보니
내가 배운 건
Fame and the money
Don’t mean a thing
I lost one, too many things
너가 뭐가 되더라도 응원할게
널 응원할게
나처럼 되지만 않으면 돼

[Hook: Kim Jong Wan]
I’m a lost one
I’m a lost one
Everything I love makes me cry
Cuz I’m a lost one
Yeah I’m a lost one
All that I live for makes me die

[Bridge: Tablo, Kim Jong Wan]
They took everything from me
They stole the ground beneath my feet
They left me high and dry
To sell a fuckin’ lie
I lost. I lost one
They took everything from me (they took everything from me)
They stole the ground beneath my feet (stole the ground beneath my feet)
Left me to die (it’s alright, alright)
I never bought the lie
I lost…
No
You lost
The One

[Outro: Tablo]
너의 꿈은 키가 닿는 꿈이길
쥘 수 있는 것만 보여주는 꿈이길
주는 만큼 뺏는 것이 성공이니까
너무 소중한 건 주지 않는 꿈이길

너의 꿈은 시선 끌지 않는 꿈이길
비밀처럼 지켜, 항상 숨을 죽이길
주는 만큼 뺏는 곳이 세상이니까
너무 꿈만 같은 건 주지 않는 꿈이길

Icarus lives

긴 꿈을 꾸길 바래

English Translation[Intro: Kim Jong Wan]
Do you remember?
All of our happy moments
Have turned into dust
A light breeze seems enough
To scatter them away
I’m afraid
I’m afraid

[Hook: Kim Jong Wan]
I’m a lost one
I’m a lost one
Everything I love makes me cry
Cuz I’m a lost one
Yeah I’m a lost one
All that I live for makes me die

[Verse 1: Tablo]
My child, when you follow
Look carefully at the path I tread
One day, I won’t be here to walk by your side
I leave my footsteps here for you
Steer clear of them
Follow those who chose the easy path
For they may have the answer
The path I chose is bent like a question mark
And only gives birth to countless problems
I hope the dream
You dreamed because of me
Won't turn out to be a nightmare when you wake up
Now that I’ve run to the very end
I see that there’s not a thing that resembles the eternity, healing and answers I was looking for
I ran down this path for my family, only to have it take my father’s life
It seems that the gunshot signaling the start
Was intended for my back
Listen well
Even if the whole world welcomes you
That same world will abandon you, so you gotta let go
Before it’s too late
Cuz I’ve been there before
This path may dazzle your eyes
But don’t be fooled by the diamonds and gold
Don’t get drunk on applause
Sometimes they will use compliments as shackles
Even when they roll out the red carpet for you, don’t forget
That it has turned red from soaking up your blood and sweat
I hope the dream
You dreamed because of me
Won't turn out to be a nightmare when you wake up
Now that I’ve run to the very end
I’ve learned that the fame and the money don’t mean a thing
I lost one too many things
Whatever you wish to become, I’ll applaud you
I’ll applaud you
Just don’t end up like me

[Hook: Kim Jong Wan]
I’m a lost one
I’m a lost one
Everything I love makes me cry
Cuz I’m a lost one
Yeah I’m a lost one
All that I live for makes me die

[Bridge: Tablo, Kim Jong Wan]
They took everything from me
They stole the ground beneath my feet
They left me high and dry
To sell a fuckin’ lie
I lost
I lost one
They took everything from me
They stole the ground beneath my feet
Left me to die
It’s all right
I never bought the lie
I lost…
No
You lost
The One

[Outro: Tablo]
I pray that your dream is a reachable one
I pray that your dream only shows you things you can touch
Because success takes as much as it gives
I pray that your dream doesn’t give you something too precious

I pray that your dream doesn’t attract attention
Protect it like a secret and always hold your breath
Because the world takes as much as it gives
I pray that your dream doesn’t only show you
The stuff of dreams

Icarus lives

I pray that you dream a long dream
