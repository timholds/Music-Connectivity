I got the Devil in my closet
And the wolf is at my door
I got the Devil in my closet
And the wolf is at my door
What's a man to do
When he can't trust his woman no more?
She says she did no wrong
And seeing him was no big thing
She says she did no wrong
And seeing him was no big thing
She ain't admitting nothing
But I believe she spread her wings
I touched her last night
And she rolled over in her sleep
I pulled her close
And softly kissed her cheek
But she whispered his name
As she pressed her chest to me
I got the Devil in my closet
And the Wolf is at my door
To my pride, it's very simple
I'll just pack and walk right out
To my pride, it's very simple
I'll just pack and walk right out
But my heart begs me to stay
If there's a shadow of a doubt
