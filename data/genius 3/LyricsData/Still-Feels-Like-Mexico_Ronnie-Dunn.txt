[Ronnie Dunn + Reba McEntire + Together]

[Verse 1]
You were with your friends, I was with mine
Hangin' on the beach you walked up and smiled
Stole a sip o' my beer
I didn't mind, you were so fine
Ended up in these arms of mine
Baby, you're still here

[Pre-Chorus]
We might be a thousand miles away
Thank God some memories never fade

[Chorus]
Still feels like Mexico
Still feels like the first time baby
Still feels like we're in Cancun
'Cause I'm still drunk on you, that beachside motel room
Still feels like those summer days
Those nights we went a little crazy
Who cares if we never go back
When you kiss me like that, still feels like Mexico

[Verse 2]
We don't need no string of lights
No Mariachi band that's right
Baby, we got this
Put those pretty lips on mine
Cross that border one more time
Let's take a little trip

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We might be a thousand miles away
Thank God some things never change

[Chorus]
Still feels like Mexico
Still feels like the first time baby
Still feels like we're in Cancun
'Cause I'm still drunk on you, that beachside motel room
Still feels like those summer days
Those nights we went a little crazy
Who cares if we never go back
When you kiss me like that, still feels like Mexico

[Interlude]

[Outro]
Still feels like those summer days
Those nights we went a little crazy
Who cares if we never go back
When you kiss me like that, still feels like Mexico

Still feels like Mexico
Oh, it feels like Mexico
Still feels like Mexico
Feels like Mexico
