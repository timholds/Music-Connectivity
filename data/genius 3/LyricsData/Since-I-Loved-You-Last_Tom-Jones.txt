Not a leaf turns green, not a sky turns blue
Not a blade of grass feels the morning dew
Not one single child ever seems to laugh
Since I loved you last

Not a sun comes out, not a drop of rain
Not one single word that relieves the pain
Not one cooling breeze, not one warming flame
Since I loved you last

Not an ocean rolls, not a river flows
Nothing ever moves, nothing ever grows
But life's an empty stage, love has left the cast
Since I loved you last

Since I loved you last, since I loved you last
Not a day goes by I don't want you back
No one else's heart could take up all my soul
Since I loved you last

Since I loved you last, since I loved you last
All I do is pray that you come back
While I just go on living in the past
Since I loved you last
