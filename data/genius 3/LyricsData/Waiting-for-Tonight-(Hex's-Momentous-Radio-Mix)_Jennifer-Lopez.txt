Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now i feel your lips
On my finger tips
I have to say its even better
Than i ever thought it could possibly be
Its perfect, its passion, its setting me free
From all of the sadness
The days that i've cried
I've spent all of my life(all of my life 8x)

Chorus
Waiting for tonight(tonight 3x)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight(tonight 3x)
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight(7x)

Tender words you say
Take my breathe away
Love me now, leave me no never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart
All alone in my bed
Tossing and turning
Emotions were strong
I knew i had to hold on

Waiting for tonight(night 3x)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight(night 3x)
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight

Ohh,ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Oh, oh, oh oh , oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

Gone all the days
When the sun used to set
On my empty heart all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew i had to hold on

Waiting for tonight(3x)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight(3x)
I've dreamed of (ohh)this love for so long
Waiting for tonight(tonight, tonight)
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight(tonight, tonight!)
I've dreamed of this love for so long for long(ohh,oh,oh,oh,oh)
Waiting for tonight(night until fade)
