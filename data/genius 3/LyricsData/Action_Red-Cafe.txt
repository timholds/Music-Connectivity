[Chorus: Kevin Cossom]
Wanna see some action baby
Up close and personal
Cause I've been watching baby
Had to come and let you know
That baby girl you got it
Let me see just what you can do
Turn it up tonight you gonna have me all over you
Bet you didn't know that I like your body

[Verse 1: Fabolous]
I'm so on her
I can't get off of her
I mean I be on watch like officer
So I give her hard liquor until it soften her
Then I get those tight clothes off of her
She just offered my head, how thoughtful huh?
I can see myself going back and fourth in her
I know I know, that it's awful huh?
But I ain't dead I usually would've coffin huh?
But shorty alive
If I give her mic bet shorty a five
A classic bitch

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Red Cafe]
I get paper everything else irrelevant
Before that girl met a don she was celibate
Maybe she keep it 100 maybe she lying
Fuck who she fucking tonight that thing mine
Boss nigga
You're in it everyday
If I ain't getting blocks of money I'm getting laid
Tree spark up then the champagne pour
Take her to the dog pound chop her down, scar
I'm a winner, lobster dinner
Sauvigon blanc, Tokyo, Hong Kong
Worldwide hustler
Red Cafe
Keep her on her toes she doing that ballet

[Chorus]x2
