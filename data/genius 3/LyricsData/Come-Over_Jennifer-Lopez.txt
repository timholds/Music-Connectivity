[Verse 1]
One, you come to my room for a little game
To you, I'll do very erotic things
I want to make love, babe, very slowly
Three times in a row, all night I'll go

[Chorus]
I love when you come over
And when you come
It gives me fever

[Verse 2]
Body next to mine
Love dance syncopated time
Sugar rush keeps me high
Sweet kiss on my thigh
I want to make love, baby, very badly
Feels good in the air every time you're here

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't keep me waiting, anticipating
Love, I am saving for you
Hear what I'm saying
You I am craving
Love is here waiting for you
All day you're staying
Please no delaying
Patiently waiting for you
Don't keep me waiting
No time for playing
Sitting here waiting for you

[Chorus]
