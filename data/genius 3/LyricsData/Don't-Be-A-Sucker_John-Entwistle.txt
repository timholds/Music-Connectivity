Better smarten up boy, Big city games are not your style
Better watch your mouth son, Cause you can even lose your smile

Chorus:
Eiffel Tower Brooklyn Bridge
You get poor and they get rich
Don't be a sucker
Don't be a sucker
Taken off a mouthful, Are you biting more then you can chew
Swim in deep water, Is the current gonna swallow you

Repeat Chorus:
Eiffel Tower Brooklyn Bridge
You get poor and they get rich
Don't be a sucker
Don't be a sucker
Walking down the alley, Seeing things you shouldn't see
Something deep inside you, Says this isn't where you ought to be
Eiffel Tower Brooklyn Bridge
You get poor and they get rich
Don't be a sucker Don't be a sucker
Don't be a sucker Don't be a sucker
Don't be a sucker Don't be a sucker
Don't be a sucker Don't be a sucker
