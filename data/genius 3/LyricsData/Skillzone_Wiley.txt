[Double S]
I been the flow F-A-R-D-A
Since old school iceberg Armani days
All I do is double the trouble and go acres
If you don’t double the hustle you don’t K
Ay, I repped it from day
Girls on the road to smoke the Bombay
Call me Mohammed Ali, cah I'm so great
And the flow should be in Guantanamo Bay
When I spray
Oh, my flow’s kinda breh
Fuck a millionaire, Double's gonna be a billionaire
I swear let’s come prepared
If you think they gonna compare, the funds are there
Double-ubble will put you in the air, no double dare
Tear, I don’t care
I will leave your bumba there
Give your girl my phone
And tell her leave her number there
Keep next week I’ll be in the underwear
Keep your number there

[Griminal]
Yo, it’s me
Eating all the MC’s
Somebody pass me a napkin
I’m a captain
What can’t you see
Give me the beat I'll eat
On a feature I'm a creature, beast
Got your girlfriend wet, wet, wet, wet
Like a new album I leak
Ice Tea, peach
Come tru like vrmmm, screech
When I end up with a mill like Meek, preach
Still got my hotel on deets
I’m a lab test gone wrong, freak

[Manga]
Them boy they couldn’t level with me then
They can't level with me now (trust)
Try messing with me how
Step in the square
Circle shell no turtles
Punchlines and hooks and you never went around
I been going in, ask anybody out
You never go 'ard like you never been around
Pause, they talk the talk when I walk it
Fact I'm flyest, I’m hovering around
Huarache hybrids that you've never seen out (can't see 'em)
That’s why you never seen me son
Like you spent the whole summer in your house
Usain when I speak, I’m runnin' with the sound (shout)
Don’t believe one word you say
You talk about stuff they never been about
I mean that I'm rich no Irish
When I got singles, that are doubling accounts

[Ghetts]
Firing!
I got that look in my eye again
Who’s Ghetts? I be the risky roads guy again
If another emcee says there the best in front of me
I tell an emcee don’t lie again (What blud!)
Personal and up close
Cut throat blade under ya neck like a violin
All these emcees want is a wheel
I'll 4x4 drive Michelin tyre them
Nah you don’t want it with that Westwood, Ghetts
Stoney on my head top
Emcee ganging up, spin 'em all over on Westwood set
I been away for a year
Had the new wave for a year
The line up I left should rep
I’ve already paid my dues
What am I saying?
There ain't a page in my cheque book left
There ain't a page in my cheque book left

[Frisco]
I came to get paid
So if you ain’t fam and it don’t involve money
Then don’t holla me
I’m on a road to riches come follow me
MOB be the policy, honestly
Think that I’m joking? Ask Wiley
It’s never been a joke ting
Holding a big spliff
Boy Better Know in your district
You will end up a statistic
If you diss Fris, I'm a headcase
Told you from [?]
Don’t get caught on the wrong side, from I
Put out the word it’s peak for you
I ain’t tweeting you online
I’ma keep you on sight
And of course I’m higher
And I burn trees like a forest fire
You man bun likkle trees like bonsai
From time it took to one time
You’re asleep for a long time

[Big Shizz]
My my my bare stand up in line
From way back man ah been grime
Ever cool, nah everyting’s fine
Across the border, cos I consider that bang out of order
Shizz enemy's fine
Never heard a couple indirects
But it's no long ting, I spin directs
Seen more stage, never been Wireless
It's ape
Everyone’s in my family's ape
Ever seen that fam it's bait
New wave but I take man way back
Little shit, he's been about from day
Been about from yonks
Man ah don’t care if you're big and tonks
Man ah don’t care if you're big and you got a likkle whip
When I lay you out on a song

[Scratchy]
I hit the nail on the head with a sledge
Hit a man over in the head with a keg
Nutmeg straight through your legs, I’m ahead
Catchy, Scratchy, d-ouble edge
He tried to say everything at once in your lyric
If that was anything it went straight over the head (miles!)
Stop drop roll, it's like
Hot shot flow, it's like
I might just bring that back from the dead
Splurt, you'll get yourself hurt
Oh my days did you hear what he said?
I can’t believe that he actually said that
Gonna end up in jail or dead
I’m nang, I’m nang
And I ain’t just saying that I actually am
You wanna diss me and my fam
That's when I'll go ham, lettuce and tomato!

[Wiley]
I bring donnies on the song for the synchers
Man are some Eskimo snowman creepers
If I wanna buy it, I can buy it on the cheapers
Stop me, I become a hurdle [?]
Work with the features
Even though I'm one of the teachers
I can never be around any leeches
Drop flows that I write that are sweeter than peaches
Then I'm billing up a [?] when it reaches
I'm gone, like a man in the middle of a farm
[?] spit down in the middle of a [?]
[?] in label [?]
And I've got a likkle house
But I'm living in a barn
Chilling in the West L Grove like Psalms
Any time I reach gyal, I'm ringing the alarm
Everyting calm
Been a soundman from the day I was born
