Ain't no grave gonna hold this body down
There ain't no grave gonna hold this body down
When I hear the trumpet sound
Gonna get up outta the ground
Cause there ain't no grave gonna hold this body down

You said go down yonder Gabriel
Place your foot on the land and sea
But don't you blow that trumpet until you hear from me

Ain't no grave gonna hold this body down
There ain't no grave gonna hold this body down
When I hear the trumpet sound
Gonna get up outta the ground
Cause there ain't no grave gonna hold this body down

Oh, look way over Jordan
What do you think I see
I saw a band of Holy Angels and they're comin' after me
I cried meet me Jesus meet me
Meet me in the middle of the air
I'm gonna rise to meet my Lord and I'll say goodbye down here

Ain't no grave gonna hold this body down
There ain't no grave gonna hold this body down
When I hear the trumpet sound
Gonna get up outta the ground
Cause there ain't no grave gonna hold this body down

One day if they carry me out to the graveyard
Like my grandma like my grandpa
And they lay this body down
Don't cry for me
Church-don't cry for me
