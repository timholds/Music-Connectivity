[Verse 1]
Hey, where did we go
Days when the rain came
Down in the hollow
Playing a new game
Laughing and a-running, hey, hey
Skipping and a-jumping
In the misty morning fog where
Our, our hearts a-thumping
And you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

[Verse 2]
And whatever happened, Tuesday and so slow
Going down to the old mine with a Transistor radio
Standing in the sunlight laughing
Hide behind a rainbows wall
Slipping and a-sliding all along the waterfall
With you, my brown eyed girl
You, my brown eyed girl

[Chorus]
Do you remember when we used to sing
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Just like that
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
La dee dah

[Verse 3]
So hard to find my way now that I'm all on my own
Saw you just the other day
My, how you have grown
Cast my memory back there, Lord
Sometime I'm overcome thinking about
Holding Hands in the green grass behind the stadium
With you, my brown eyed girl
Yeah, you, my brown eyed girl

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
Sha la la la la la la la la la la dee dah
