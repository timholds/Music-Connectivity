Wanna be a pretty boy
Wanna go on Solid Gold
Wanna date a millionaire
Wanna make people stare

[Chorus]
I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I wanna be on TV

Studio 54
Gonna be on the floor
Gonna make people dance
Gonna take off my pants

[Chorus]

Wanna make a scene
Gonna get some freako cocaine
Gonna wear my Calvin Klein's
Emmy awards will be all mine

[Chorus]
