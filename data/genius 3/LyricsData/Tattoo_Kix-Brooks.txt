[Verse 1]
I met her on the tailgate told me she was sweet on me
And she said I got something you might like to see
Yeah I got a little peak driving in my car
And she finally let me see it out behind the barn
She said her daddy kill us both if he ever knew
Ya I'm talking about my baby's tattoo

[Verse 2]
If you ever get to see it
Well your going to want to see it again
(want to see it, Ooo I want see it)
And it looks a little different just depending on the way she bends
It's the cutest little thing that I've ever seen
On a model, in a movie, or a magazine
Funny how some eagle make you think
There's nothing she won't do
Ya I'm talking about my baby's tattoo

[Chorus]
Ooo it looks so good
Make men crazy, baby tell me what would
Make a sweet thing like you get a thing like that
(what were you thinking)
Couple crazy girlfriends out on a dare
Drinking margaritas like you just don't care
The next thing you know well your sitting in a chair
Trying to remember what he's drawing down there

[Verse 3]
I can't tell you what it looks like
I can't tell you where it is
And chances are you never gonna see it
So I'll tell you this
(want to see it, really want to see it)
It's not a rose on her ankle, and a heart on her hand
But it'll put a smile on the face of any man
The kinda thing that'll look hot when shes ninety two
Ya I'm talking about my baby's tattoo
Ya talking about my baby's tattoo

[Chorus]
