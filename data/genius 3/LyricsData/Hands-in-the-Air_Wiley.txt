[Verse 1: Wiley]
If I've ever let you down then I'm sorry, it was my fault
That's the truth, honest, no hype talk
I respect the fans, they're still here
I was being a prick but I still cared
Anytime I win a race, champion
See a talent doing great, I stamp 'em
It's who I am, it's what I do
It's one of them musical things I gotta do

[Hook: Tulisa & Wiley]
Everybody put your hands in the air
Everybody put your hands in the air, air
Without my fans, I couldn’t do this
And sometimes I forget then
I'm reminded by the ones
Who have my back, they say they knew it
Everybody put your hands in the air, air

[Verse 2: Wiley]
You're the fifth girl I've seen tonight
Who's asked me if I'm here to party
You're one of them fit girls, I see precisely
Why I wanna speak to you 'cause you’re flighty
And I’m a cool dude, you would like me
Babe, there's nobody like me
Hello I’m Kylea AKA Wiley
And I live the life of Riley
A lyrical scripture
Led to a following, led to a picture
Came from the radio, decks on the mixer
Now I'm alright like rosé spritzer
And I share that with you 'cause you made me
And it's for that reason I can’t forget ya
Put your hands in the air, everybody one time
To be honest, I'm glad I met ya

[Hook: Tulisa & Wiley]
Everybody put your hands in the air
Everybody put your hands in the air, air
Without my fans, I couldn’t do this
And sometimes I forget then
I'm reminded by the ones
Who have my back, they say they knew it
Everybody put your hands in the air, air

[Verse 3: Ice Kid]
'Cause I'm feeling like I'm in my last days, lost in the world like Kanye
This heartache done with the parley
I wanna live life like a star
My past has been harder than bars on a park gate
Play more games than an arcade
'Till my heart change like an ace in a card game
Last chance so I can't wait
For time to pass like an R8 in the fast lane
Get it done, get it done, gotta get it done
Feel on my back but I'm getting up
It's like the fans couldn't get enough
They want me back in the seminar
Left but I'm still on the map like Edinburgh
They can act like they're better but
I’mma tell them once [?] you better run
You better laugh while you can cause the fact is
When I'm a champion, I'mma laugh at everyone

[Hook: Tulisa & Wiley]
Everybody put your hands in the air
Everybody put your hands in the air, air
Without my fans, I couldn’t do this
And sometimes I forget then
I'm reminded by the ones
Who have my back, they say they knew it
Everybody put your hands in the air, air

[Outro: Tulisa]
Everybody put your hands in the air
Everybody put your hands in the air
Everybody put your hands in the air
Everybody put your hands in the air
Everybody put your hands in the air
Everybody put your hands in the air
