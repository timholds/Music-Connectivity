If the one you'd think is true ever turns his back on you
You've still got a place in my heart
If every road you take proves you've made a big mistake
You've still got a place in my heart

For if I'm a fool to pray that you'll come back some day
Then I'll know a million fools that love has made that way
If the years should make you cry don't go on and live a lie
Baby you've still got a place in my heart

For if I'm a fool to pray that you'll come back some day
Then I'll know a million fools that love has made that way
If every road you take proves you've made a big mistake
Baby you've still got a place in my heart
Yes, you've still got a place in my heart...
