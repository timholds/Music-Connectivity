[Verse 1]
It was a surprise seeing you there last night
You changed your hair
Well I think I really like it
It was more than that
You had a glow you've never had
Looks like that other guy
Was just the thing you needed
For a while I worry
It’s clear now there’s no need

[Chorus]
You should see you now
It’s like you’re floating on a cloud
We were something I just couldn't figure out
But that’s a good thing, that’s a good thing
You should see you now

[Verse 2]
I guess it’s for the best
What good are regrets
For a second I admit it made me wonder
Oh seeing you that way
Love there on your face
I knew right then that things
Had turned out like they ought a
I was blind back then
Now my eyes are wide open

[Chorus][x2]
