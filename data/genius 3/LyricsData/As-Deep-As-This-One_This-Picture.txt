Did you see that man beat his wife, she in love and he in life?
Did you ever see a scar as deep as this one?
And see that child walk to him, broken mind and battered limb
Did you ever see a divide as deep as this one was?

I can't bring myself bring myself to say it, I hope you can

Did you hear that man confess of secrets born in tenderness
Did you ever hear a lie as great as this one was?
So how can you face the regret time has scared but shall forget?
Did you ever take a stand as great as this one was?

I can't bring myself to say it, I hope you can
Won't you say it, won't you say it please

So you see that man rape his wife, she in love and he in life?
Did you ever see a scar as deep as this one?
