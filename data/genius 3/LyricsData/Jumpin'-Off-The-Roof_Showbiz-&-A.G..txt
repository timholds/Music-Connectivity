[Verse 1: A.G.]
I'm trying to reach the masses
With my speech till I decease to ashes
I'm so deep I should speak to classes
And my curriculum: "How to be a Ruler like Rick and them"
Raped by the system
So now it's "fuck the system then"
She's swinging, I'm pitching and
Switching like six of them
Bronx embedded, impossible to edit
The same way the founders keep it, I kept it
With ease and with no effort
Yeah success is a disease but you don't breathe when you catch it
The breeze in the desert, accept it:
Show & A here for the long haul
Sucker-free and we stay away from cornballs

[Hook: A.G.]
These niggas jumping off the roof now
And I ain't even get a chance to shoot yet
Stupid niggas jumping off the roof now
Before I even get a chance to shoot

[Verse 2: A.G.]
My neighborhood resemble a jungle
Boy turned wolf but still remain humble
We etched in stone, impossible to undo
Pressure make me a diamond, pressure make you crumble
Let's just say you fumble
And I pick it up and go the other way
Dancing in the end-zone, my mother say
She so proud of what I've become, and since
I'm her only one, every day is Mother's Day
If you ain't down to ride then get the fuck away
If you a rider then fuck with A
And struggle builds character
You can't be a champ if you don't have a challenger
Come on

[Hook]

[Verse 3: A.G.]
So diverse I curse the bubblegum rapper
Turning my culture into laughter, nah homeboy
I'm a champ, see it hanging from the rafter?
So I make it harder for those that go after
The quiet storm, it's art at its highest form
Mama threw the crown on the day I was born
I'm a lion, you just lyin'
Go against The Giant,
Music is a science, not shit that we tryin'
I'm flyin', you stranded on the runway
So underground they built a booth in the motherfucking subway
Shell-Toe Adidas like Run & D and them
Sucker MCs, I find and ether them
The fourth generation that A is speaking to
Since Peanut Chews, Gazelles, and Adidas suits
To Timberlands, heirs and Montclairs
Don't matter with me, when I speak they all ears

[Hook]

[Outro: A.G.]
There's so many, so many, so many, so many things I want to say
There's so many, so many, so many, so many things I need to say
