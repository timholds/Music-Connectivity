Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear saviors birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Til he appeared and the soul felt it's worth
A thrill of hope the weary soul rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

[Chorus: x2]
Oh fall on your knees
Oh hear the angels voices
Oh night divine
Oh holy night
When Christ was born

Holy night, holy night
When Christ was born
Holy night, holy night, holy night oh holy night

Holy night, holy night
When Christ was born
Holy night, holy night, holy night oh holy night

Holy night, holy night
When Christ was born
Holy night, holy night, holy night oh holy night

Holy night until fade
