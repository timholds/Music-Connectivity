We're on this rollercoaster ride
Hold on, I'll stay here by your side
We head up to the sky then we slide back down
Upside down try to figure out
Not sure if we could work it out
I wanna be alone but you feel like home

Answer the phone, I know that you're home
I wanna get you alone, and do it again, do it again
Answer the phone, I know that you're home
I wanna get you alone, and do it again, do it again

The signals all are flashing red
It doesn't matter what was said
This bed is much too big without me and you
This all seems so ridiculous
Why can't we just get over this
Don't make me say the obvious
Without you

Answer the phone, I know that you're home
I wanna get you alone, and do it again, do it again
Answer the phone, I know that you're home
I wanna get you alone, and do it again, do it again

I practice all my lines to a telephone while you were sleeping
I practice all my lines to a telephone while you were sleeping
I practice all my lines to a telephone while you were sleeping
I remember the way you curled your toes
On the side of the stage at all our shows
And the glow on your face just because of one rose
And when I wake up in the morning and you're wearing my clothes

Answer the phone, I know that you're home
I wanna get you alone, and do it again, do it again
Answer the phone, I know that you're home
I wanna get you alone, and do it again, do it again
Do it again, do it again and do it again, do it again
I wanna do it again, do it again and do it again, do it again
