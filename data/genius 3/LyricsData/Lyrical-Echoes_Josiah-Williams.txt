I need you to hold me tight and never let go
As a reminder speak it to me through an echo

[Verse One:]
Beautiful lyric, you speak to me like we’ve never met
Lyrics worthy of changing the world, noble reason
You make emotions that have settled never want to set
And make a daisy want to sprout in a different season
Speak slowly my rhythmic triplet
Tell me that you’re clear and precise, articulate
I need you to hold me tight and never let go
As a reminder speak it to me through an echo

[Hook:]
Capture my attention
Fall in love with my ability
Fall asleep until the dream comes
And awake a new stability

I need you to hold me tight and never let go
As a reminder speak it to me through an echo

[Verse Two:]
I’m in a unity with melody & harmony
The sweetest pain without actually harming me
I’m at my lowest and I know it, call me bass clef
And you kept me steady even when the bass left
Presence everlasting, musical engraving
You give me the purpose for this surface that I’m paving
I need you to hold me tight and never let go
As a reminder speak it to me through an echo

[Andrew Durham (Saxophone Solo) – Verse 3]

[Hook:]
Capture my attention
Fall in love with my ability
Fall asleep until the dream comes
And awake a new stability

I need you to hold me tight and never let go
As a reminder speak it to me through an echo
