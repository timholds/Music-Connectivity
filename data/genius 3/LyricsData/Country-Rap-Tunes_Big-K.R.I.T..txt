[Chorus]
This for all my country folk
Slamming them Caddy doors
Sitting out on the porch
Fresh from head to toe
This for all my Southern kin
Be proud of who you is
No matter where and when
Let 'em know the game you're in
This for all my country folk

[Verse 1]
Back on my grind again, wasting no time again
Putting it on the line, been losing, I'm tryna win
Whenever, right now is the better
Hoping all those stars and planets align together
Tryna weather the storm, go beyond and gone
Find all of life's treasures and bring 'em to my home
Like, like we made it Sippi-land, country and all of that
Tell all them haters congratulate us or fall back
Cause I'm in my old school, traveling to the A
Don't worry, little baby brother, I'll be back like any day
Spread the word, I flip verbs like birds
Get flipped by dope boys that park rims on the curb
Got my CD in they deck, bop they heads, break they neck
Whispering that I got next to execs
That never heard of Mississippi lyricists
Not even visionaries envision this

[Chorus]
This for all my country folk
Slamming them Caddy doors
Sitting out on the porch
Fresh from head to toe
This for all my Southern kin
Be proud of who you is
No matter where and when
Let 'em know the game you're in
This for all my country folk

[Verse 2]
Leave it behind, the, the, the crime
Fighting for every yard across the poverty line
Any given Sunday could be my last
Pay my tithes with the gas money or let the plate pass
Cause God can understand the lows
The feeling of being stranded on the side of the road
Watching all the fancy cars come and go
Like it couldn't get no worse, but it storms some more
Cause whenever it rains, little buddy, it pours
When you need the sunshine like the most
But even a magnolia fights to grow
Under certain circumstances similar to yours
I just wanna be heavenly, I suppose
Cause success never, ever save your soul
I came from the bottom of the map to show
The world that it's more to us country folk

[Chorus]
This for all my country folk
Slamming them Caddy doors
Sitting out on the porch
Fresh from head to toe
This for all my Southern kin
Be proud of who you is
No matter where and when
Let 'em know the game you're in
This for all my country folk
