If the sun is to set
To leave us dark with regret
I will work up the strength
To pull our earth back round again
And if the ocean should freeze
Before we've sailed all the seas
I will drop to my knees
Until Poseidon agrees

We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night
(x2)

If you get scared of the space
Between now and those days
Then I will take you away
Somewhere fear has no place
We'd make ashes of our clothes
And grow a garden out of those
And watch the water as it rose
To bring the ocean to our toes

We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night
(x2)

It's true
Distance just makes my heart grow for you
And everything I want for us to do
To build an island between me and you
Build an island between me and you

We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
And we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep

We could build an island
You and I could swim beside
Where we could ride the tides
Until we fall asleep at night
(x2)

We could build an island
We could ride the tides
Oh, we could build an island
Until we fall asleep at night...
