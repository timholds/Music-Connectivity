Your natural state is enlightening. Everything else you've ever been told about yourself is a lie. We are trying to wake ourselves up, because we come from source energy and we are ALL one. We have to realize that our brothers and sisters that we are seeing in the dream, are mere reflections of our inner self. Yin and yang, love and hate. People that we dislike, are mere reflections of our own character defects. People that we like and love are true successful manifestations of our deepest most inner self. We are beings of light. Our mission, is to be creation, and create positive energy on spaceship Earth
