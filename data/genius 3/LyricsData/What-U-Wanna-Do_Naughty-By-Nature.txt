Y'all need some rock n roll in your life
Yeah, yeah, its Pink, feelin' naughty

[Hook: Pink]

I like the way you rock, I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound, the way you put it down
No way that I can fight it, I got my eye on you
You got me so excited, so what you gonna do?

[Verse 1: Treach]
I dig deep like the ship sunk, saw Pink cutie wink once
Had on fitted jeans, thong showing, pink pumps
Puppy named Fucker, back to her body, boom bow
Escalation push had ribs like, oh, child

Taking you to lunch, what you gonna do?
She said, "Im picking up the check and
Handing it to you", fine and witty, oh, so pretty
Drop the Gucci, prop that coochie, oops

I lost my train of thought watching her walk
You know, Im looking at that ass, it ain't my fault
Get drinks, get laugh, get talk, get long
Got Pink, got hash, got smoke, got blunts

Rhinestones spiffy, shes more than pretty
Lovin' my thuggin', rubbin' my fifty nine fifty
Bullets in your bra or your nipples, hey
We laughed, talked shit, then next she said

[Hook: Pink]
I like the way you rock, I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound, the way you put it down
No way that I can fight it, I got my eye on you
You got me so excited, so, baby, what you gonna do?

[Verse 2: Vin Rock]
Check it, first met her at the Fox Hill mall, getting out of her car
She had a homie with her stood about six feet tall
Both swing couldn't help but think manajatwa
So where you from we represent Crenshaw

Where they bang by law, slip your jack in your car
Oh, and Im Kelly and her name is Sherry
And she likes to sip yeagermister from her belly
Well show you if you wanna we can go hit the deli
Man, I dont think youre ready for this jelly

All pre-trick, a major erection before we go pull over at a 7-11
Protection is a must to survive and in ghetto heaven
You gotta wrap it up before you go and put your head in
We pulled up and jumped right in bed
While caressing my head, they looked up and said

[Hook: Pink]
I like the way you rock, I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound, the way you put it down
No way that I can fight it, I got my eye on you
You got me so excited, so what you gonna do?

Thats the way, kay, kay
Naughty likes it, kay, kay

[Verse 3: Treach]
What I wanna do you had to pick that question
Kiss it, lick it, extra friction, flex it
Love the kitty, tongue and tittie, till you sweat it
Toss you 'round my room like boom' Ill press it
I like, I like, back forth, heave ho

Round and round, baby, round we go
And I ain't here to taste the poom poom for hours
Im here to make your poom poom hours
In the shower, in the sauna, in the deli
Boom Machiavelli, KY jelly, ass to belly

Get peace with it, slap it, slap it
Treat the mattress like a human magnet, grab it
I like the way you slide it, ride it
Dont hide it, divide it, Im two steps behind it

[Hook: Pink]
I like the way you rock, I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound, the way you put it down
No way that I can fight it, I got my eye on you
You got me so excited, so what you gonna do?
Tell me, baby, oh, yeah

I like the way you rock, I hope you never stop
I like the way you sound, the way you put it down
No way that I can fight it, I got my eye on you
You got me so excited, so what you gonna do?

So what you gonna do? Yeah, yeah
I can't fight it, babe, you know I gotta get it, babe
You gotta give it to me, babe, oh, what you gonna do?
