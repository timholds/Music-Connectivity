[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Wondering if I'm wasting my time
Rapping about this nerdy shit
Tight like a double knit
With references ya'll never get
But fuck that man, I do it for the love of it
I do it to try and confirm I do fit
In; reference of what I love in the hopes I won't forget
Working what I love into tracks trying to submit

[Hook V1]
With my team, and Chie, that's my girl
TV hopping trying to save the god damned world
Persona style, so motherfucking save yourself
Accept the darkness that you've locked deep inside the cell

[Verse 2]
Got listeners at the ends of the earth
I'll take it for what it's worth, rhyming till I hit the dirt
Step outside yourself, and learn a damn lesson, listen to this track man, school is in session
Don't hear it, listen to the words, process that shit and think on what you've heard

[Hook V1 X1]

[Hook V2]
With my team, and Chie, that's my girl
TV hopping tryin to save the god damned world
Persona style, so motherfucking face yourself
Accept the darkness that you've locked deep inside the cell
