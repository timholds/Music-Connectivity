It seemed like just another Christmas Eve
The kids had left some milk and cookies to eat
We cuddled up and read "The Night Before Christmas" again
I headed down for one more holiday snack
I saw this fat man with a pack on his back
Call me crazy but there's toys and stuff all over the den

Santa's coming over to your house
Christmas coming down the line
Santa's coming over to your house
I know 'cause he just left mine

He left a Barbie and a video game
He filled the stockings with the red candy canes
He hid a skateboard and a football up under the tree
I heard him holler and he pulled out of sight
"A Merry Christmas and to all a good night"
I know what you're thinking
But I'm telling you, ya got to believe

Santa's coming over to your house
Christmas coming down the line
Santa's coming over to your house
I know 'cause he just left mine
