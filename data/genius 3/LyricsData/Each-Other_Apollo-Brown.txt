“...Failed to answer (“why did he leave me?”)
Why did he leave?”

[Intro]
C’mon
Check
Let’s go
Ayo

[Verse 1]
I can think of many ways that we can go our separate ways, but never this
Never imagined I would lose a path and we'd exist in separate worlds
But we came together boy and girl and it made sense
Felt like a puzzle piece effortlessly falling into place
When we walked in the space, they didn’t understand
I didn’t look like anyone you’re messing with
And even then, you rocked with me, proudly introduced me to the fam
Got me saying “god, this is heaven sent”
Planted seeds for what we planned them for
You were my daily practice rituals and action, I wanted to grow
And so I fed us, I prayed to God everyday
And I can honestly say that she answered every one of those
Opened up the doors, the windows and the glass on the ceiling cracks
So I can pass through on tippy toes
My blessings from above, I nurtured you like I would do a child in the womb
Until the tomb, my first love

[Hook]
“Why did he leave me?”
I need you, you need me, we need each other, love
“Why did he leave me?”
I leave you, you leave me, we leave each other ‘cause
“Why did he leave me?”
I need you, you need me, we need each other, love
“Why did he leave me?”
I leave you, you leave me, we leave each other

[Verse 2]
Come to be my love, you make it harder and harder, just put down the gloves
If I didn’t care, I wouldn’t bother that we came through stuff
So many times, I want to break
But instead, I stayed late awake almighty said “wait”
And so I figured love, you needed proof of my fidelity
You seen enough to make it hard to see what’s relevant
Not peoples, place, and things, but people over things
Somebody to celebrate you, the insecurity obscures your view
I think about you, but then I think about God
And think he’s greater than the both of us, the hurt that we caused
What are the odds? We’re still growing, the going is hard
Whatever it’ll be is what it is, remember the start?
I got to thinking, love, I like to open the windows
You like to close ‘em up, do you believe in what you see?
I see a world of intangibles where dreams are made up
Maybe we were brought together just so we come undone
C’mon

[Hook]

[Outro]
Lord
I feel like this beat
Anyway
I said all that I had to say
That’s it
I’m done
