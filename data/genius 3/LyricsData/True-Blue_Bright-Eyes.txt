I am a blue blood I will admit that
I dance in blue shoes and wear a blue hat
Live in a blue house, on a blue street
In a blue town by a blue creek
I write my blue songs with my blue pen
I sing the blue notes to my blue friends
Now I don't know that much about you
But I like you because you're true blue

I had a blue dream about a blue star
In it I drove there in my blue car
And when I got there, I met a blue dog
With a blue tongue, we had some real fun
We bounced a blue ball. It broke a blue glass
We banged on blue drums and called it bluegrass
Guess the thing I'm trying to tell you
Is that it's best kid if you're true blue

Once I had gangrene, I got it real bad
And so the Doc came with his black bag
I said "You know doc, I don't feel swell
If you had a blue bag I think I'd feel well."
So he came right back with a blue sack
He said, "Will this do?" I said, "Why not? Yeah."
That's how I am here today to tell you
That it's best man to be true blue

Out on the blue sea I sailed a blue ship
I had a first mate, always had blue lips
His name was Bluebeard
He had a weird twitch
We flew a blue flag on a big stick
And we ate bluegill and we ate blue chips
Oh, I felt real blue eating that blue fish
Because there ain't much that I won't do
Unless it keeps me from being true blue

Once in a blue moon there's a blue sky
I wear my blue jeans and fly my blue kite
Hangs like a bluebird until the wind dies
And then the tears pour out of my blue eyes
If it's your birthday, we'll bake a blue cake
And then we'll eat it off these blue plates
Cause kid I don't know much about you
But I like you because you're true blue
Yeah, I don't know much about you
But I like you cause you're true blue
