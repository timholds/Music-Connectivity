[Verse One]
Can't wait to get home
Baby dial your number
Can you pick up the phone
Cause I wanna holla
Daydreaming about you all day
In school can't concentrate
Want have your voice in my ear
'Til mama comes and says it's too late

[Hook]
Cause the lights are on outside
Wish there was somewhere to hide
Cause I just don't want to say goodbye
Cause you are my baby, baby
Nothing really matters
I don't really care
What nobody tell me
I'm gonna be here
It's a matter of extreme importance
My first teenage love affair

[Verse Two]
Another secret meeting
On the 5th floor stair case
I'm gonna give you this letter
Of all the things I can't say
Want you to be my first, my last,my ending and beginning
I wrote your name in my book
You last name my first
I'm your Mrs

[Hook]

[Dialogue]
Hey boy
You know I really like being with you right?
Just hanging out with you is fun

[Bridge]
So maybe we can go to first base
Because I feel you
Second base
Want you to feel me too
Third base
Better pump the breaks
Well baby slow down
I gotta go home now

[Hook 2x]
