[Hook]
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you got sideburns and a vintage tee
I said you ain't artiser than me
Cuz you pluck a guitar, that ain't fuckin bizarre
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you live in Los Feliz, bitch you ain't Jesus
You ain't artsier than me
I got a colorful vocab, watch the low jab

[Verse 1]
So what you're vegan?
It shows in your presence, you be geekin'
And you been seekin' the same light
Speakin' of game like the enemy, hang tight
I got a tail about 6 foot 1 by infinity
Full of sun, rain & potential energy
All you saw were the K-Swiss
Clean, crisp, creased jeans means this
So you thought and dipped
My walks hip, thoughts; hipper
Unzip the zipper
No I don't wear hemp or drink liquor
And that don't make me the man, just a little bit sicker
Spit kicker with an eye for the big dipper
From an island cliff emerges a loud whisper
And I'm proud of this, it's my art
You doin yoga just to look the part

[Hook]
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you chop up breaks and you dig in the crates
You ain't artsier than me
You just a trendy lesbian, dreadlock thespian
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you make weed brownies and knit wool hats
You ain't artsier than me
You pseudo-elitist old-school sap

[Verse 2]
Don't let an 808 scare ya
Shake stripes off your shirt and clear the whole area
I'm a humanoid too
And if you're cool with me then I'll look past the void in you
Instead of through
I'm down with VW's and flossed-out caddys on 22's too
I bang for good
Fools, kill for nothin'
I build for somethin'
Family and peace
Hand me the piece
I'll hit it, I'm social
Hear my opinion
I'm proud, I'm vocal
Local in a foreign place
More digital than dusty
But trust me, I be tourin' space
You be whorin' at a comfortable pace
You be skippin a chore to jump in a race
I be bumpin my bass like you collect comics
I'm not weird, I'm honest

[Hook]
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you only read books, don't watch T.V
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you shop at Whole Foods in open-toed shoes
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you speak real soft and drink Chai tea
You ain't artsier than me
I recycle too, I'm kinda like you

[Verse 3]
I just look cleaner, grown demeanor
Wear deodorant, registered voter
And a tree hugger too
Not in these clothes
Me lova you but it's gotta be both ways
Most days I'm earthy, stay grounded
Often it's a paper chase, I'm well-rounded
Straight to face, townish
It's all boundless
I make it sound universally dope
Overcome adversity, reshape the worst of me
Do it for the love and release it commercially
Like a blockbuster started at Sundance
Can't stop man you only get one chance
Presentation is key, hesitation ain't see
Innovation is my A-R-T
Dedication is free, occupation is me
Innovation is my A-R-T

[Hook]
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you drive a hybrid and carpool with three
You ain't artsier than me
Cuz you a 16th Mexican, you ain't ethnic
And you ain't artsier than me
You just a broke ass poet with the same old cadence
You ain't artsier than me
We was conscious first, welcome to Earth
