Woah, oh

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I got the love for money, I gotta have it
The lust for living lavish, gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I gotta have it
Love for money, I got the love for money
I gotta have it
The lust for living lavish, gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I gotta have it
Love for money, I got the love for money

[Verse 1: Willie the Kid]
Chillin' with two women, me & Mr. Thanksgiving
I be somewhere fly, Thanksgiving goin' swimmin'
While you was wearin' snorkels, I was out snorkelin'
Of course, I'm shittin' on these niggas like porcelain
It's more than love with this money, I'm infatuated
Captivated by the diamonds encapsulated
Shootin' range in the basement, Olympic size pool
A pool table adjacent, I love me some money

[Verse 2: Gucci Mane]
I stash money, fast money, come on, I'm pumpin' them onions
Buckin' and crossin' the country, Sosa, don't cross me you monkey
Sleepin' on fifties and twenties, rollin' up onions and hundreds
Pullin' in Porsche's and Phantom's, fancies be throwin' they panties
Drama and Cannon they family, Gucci and Drama they panic
Ugh, they sick, they vomit, put some more commas in front it
Drama got Gucci, he stunted, Gucci and Drama, we jammin'
We got so much money 'bout our money, so money, more money dummy

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I got the love for money, I gotta have it
The lust for living lavish, gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I gotta have it
Love for money, I got the love for money
I gotta have it
The lust for living lavish, gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I gotta have it
Love for money, I got the love for money

[Verse 3: LA the Darkman]
See money, money got a big house
Money got a bad girl, money make you famous
Money rule the whole world, money set trends
Money is in the Benz, money got associates actin' like friends
Money money, he old, money money, he bold
Money got sexy ladies dancin' on the pole
Money got 'em on the stroll, money, platinum and gold
Money make 'em shake it like Beyonc√© Knowles

[Verse 3: Yung Joc]
Only God knows the things I do for money
That's a young fly bad bitch, a tenderoni
Check out them dimensions, twenties, fifties and hundreds
Don't she make me look good when you see us out stuntin'?
Niggas catch a whiff, find out that's your bitch
Catch a pusher in your whip, then they go and push them clips
She got me goin' crazy, I'm coo coo for boo-koo bucks
Plus I can't lie boo, it's only you I love

[Hook: Trey Songz]
I got the love for money, I gotta have it
The lust for living lavish, gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I gotta have it
Love for money, I got the love for money
I gotta have it
The lust for living lavish, gotta get that green paper stackin'
Love for money, I gotta have it
Love for money, I got the love for money

[Verse 4: Bun B]
I'm 'bout my issue, I'm 'bout my dough
I'm on my hustle, man, you already know
I'm hittin' stains, I'm hittin' liqs
I'm packin' pounds and baggin' bricks
You got them nicks, I got a lab
You talkin' whole's but sellin' halves
Where's your connect? How much he got?
That's all he holdin'? Man, I'll buy him out

[Hook: Trey Songz]
