Talk to me softly
There's something in your eyes
Don't hang your head in sorrow
And please don't cry
I know how you feel inside-- I've been there before
Something is strange inside you
And you don't know

Don't you cry tonight
I still love you
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you, baby
Don't you cry tonight

Give me a whisper
And hear me sigh
Give me a kiss before you tell me goodbye
Don't you take it so hard now
And please don't take it so bad
I'll still be thinking of you
And the times we had. Baby

Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
Don't you cry tonight

And please remember
That I never lied
And please remember
How I felt inside
Now honey, you've got to make it your own way
But you'll be alright
Now sugar, you'll feel better tomorrow
Comming home in light

Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
Don't you cry tonight
There's a heaven above you baby
Don't you cry, don't you ever cry
Don't you cry tonight
