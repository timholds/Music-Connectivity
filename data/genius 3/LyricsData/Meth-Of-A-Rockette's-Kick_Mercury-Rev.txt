Mounds of feeble trouble drop from the skies
I've seen an ailing nothing where the outer space lies
Powder kegs and marbles turn from grey to green eyes
I won't be sentimental
Stay at a hospital tonight

Hydrophonic sonic rhymes
Submerge me in the water until I'm free of all crimes
Brussel propulsive healthy mouses
Gurgle in slime
And fondle all the fishes and make them all cheer up

Rage in their souls gotta be controlled
I'm often confused

Waves in the pool
Burr in my side
Make it come back
You make it connect
You make it come true
And that's it
Holes in my head
I'm holding my head
And it's slow motion blues
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free

Cutting burned spiders
Worshipping twine
Laughing out the sugars in the sticky strange shrine
Drinking mountain cider by the suicide mines
I want to be fighter when the pilot's not lit up
Screaming, sucking, slurping chimes
It often makes me wonder if we'll be through in time
(???) boces
Gurgle in grime
Shoot it like a loon until you make the skin clear up
Rage in the soul gotta be controlled
And I'm often confused
Often confused

Waves in the water
Burr in my side
Make it come back
You make it connect
You make it come true
And that's it
Holes in my head
I'm holding my head
And it's coming from you
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free

Make it come back
You make it connect
You make it come true
And that's it
Holes in my head
I'm holding my head
And it's slow motion blues
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free
I'm free
