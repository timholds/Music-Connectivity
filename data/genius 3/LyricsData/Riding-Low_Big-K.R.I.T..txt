[Intro: Big KRIT]
Young Krizzle
I appreciate everybody out there listening to this right now
See Me On Top volume 4 shawty
And Cadillactica coming soon
November pimpin' it's going down

[Hook] (x2)
I'm riding low, low, low, low, low
Got nowhere to go
I'm out in smoke

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Cl-cl-club jumping, late night on the creep
Ain't nowhere to be
Push a ham sandwich on them peas
Searching for the cheese with a flashlight
Damn I gotta get this act right
Hear my partner bout this boppa that was boppin
But what her ass like?
That shawty, she was that shawty back in High School
Grew up to be fly, when them buss-its used to slide through
Remember little devil that used to hang out with your sister?
Yeah she a bad mother fucker
Plus I heard that she a stripper
Check her Instagram pictures
Yeah she twerking at the shake junt
Now she down for cutting just for showing his 808's thump
I know, people don't dance no more
But when she on that pole
To be honest she can go
Make me throw a little bit more
Than a playa probably should have
There's a thin line between trickin' and woulda, coulda..
Fucked her, if I had a chance
But all she did was stack the money
Thank me for the bands

[Hook] (x2)

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
I'm riding low
Still solo dolo at the corner store
Leaning on my whip like I got vertigo
Screening for them laws
That just stress you cause when you trying to get it in some
That when they catch you on a lonely night, super quiet
My eyes wide shut, to my surprise
Picked up birds with plenty feathers with my eagle eye
Bonafide, the ass fatter than Pirelli tires
Let me reside in your domicile
[BIIIISH]
I said that under my breath, but
She preceded to walk over to me like you gon' step, huh
I said yeah cuz, you ain't wait your man
It's 3 in the morning, you look lonely, help me understand
So we parlay, parlay, parlay..
Asked if I was down to escort her to this party
Then maybe we could kick it after?
Her girlfriend cancel..
Cause she a private dancer
I answer
I'm riding low

[Hook] (x2)
