"Can you hear? Can you hear me? Oh, you were sleeping?
Yes, yes, I can hear you. Sorry you've woken up

Nothing that important to say. It might just be a funny story. Aa...

Can you hear? Can you hear me? Just like this for a little longer
Yes, yes, I can hear you. Thank you for listening to me

We won't be able to meet for awhile. I'll say good night
That's the end of this call. That's that...

I love you, Mama. There's nothing else at all
I love you. I love you. There's nothing else

I love you, Mama. I can't say it well any more
I love you. I love you. There's nothing else

We won't be able to meet for awhile. Only a good night
That's the end of this call. Well, then...

I love you, Mama. There's nothing else at all
I love you. I love you. There's nothing else

I love you, Mama. I can't hear you clearly any more
I love you. I love you. There's nothing else

My heart is going to break. I will go hurt someone
I won't stop, no. I'm going

I love you, Mama. I can't say it well any more
I love you. I love you. There's nothing else..."
