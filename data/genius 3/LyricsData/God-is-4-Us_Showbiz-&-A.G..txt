[Verse 1]
So many souls are dying while they living
Hope God forgive 'em, they just trying to make a living
Now over there they prepare for the future
Here they kill your dream like the shooter did Martin Luther
Used to fight man, now we fight computers
That riddle niggas, little niggas drive by on scooters
They put silence on the Ruger
Lose you in the Triangle, nowhere near Bermuda
Repeat the past of Malik Shabazz
Now your roof is leaking
That's all because the truth is being
Spoken, runaway slave the slogan
Like Moses, a golden child or the chosen
Frozen, cuz where I'm from news don't come
Niggas choose to do dumb
At funerals I'm numb
They shot him in the hood now he on the floor bleeding
He stop for a second, kept on speaking cuz

[Hook x4]
So many demons be talking to me
God is for us, then who can be against us?

[Verse 2]
It's like he traded Sean John for a jumper
He threw his baby in the dumpster, right next to the baby mama
Now he a menace, attached to a life sentence
God is for us, then who can be against us?
Same ones give you twelve and a half twice
Don't know what it's like with your life doing flips at night
Teacher never saw a kid that bright
Became a statistic, his classmate gave him the business
So many demons be talking to me
I'd probably throw my life away if God wasn't walking with me
They say we doomed and we only good for combat
Tell Denzel, tell Obama, tell LeBron that
Now you can find soldiers behind enemy lines
Not just Iraq, but correction confines
They'll erase your mug, the niggas you hate to love
It's going down when that tape come up

[Hook x4]
