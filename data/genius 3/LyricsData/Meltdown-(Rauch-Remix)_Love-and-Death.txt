I think I’m having a meltdown

I feel the tension
(I feel the tension)
Confessions told
(Tell me, tell me everything)
Insanity is taking over, the fantasies are driving me mad

Before, never let go
Before I fold
Before, never let go
Before I fold

You know that I am heading for a meltdown, controlling me losing it all
You know that I am heading for a meltdown, just take away the tears
I’m suffocating, don’t leave me here waiting

The cry within
(Cry within)
The flesh is bold
(Tell me, tell me everything)
Calamity is waiting silent, the razor is cutting the pain and letting it out

Before, never let go
Before I fold
Before, never let go
Before I fold

You know that I am heading for a meltdown, controlling me losing it all
You know that I am heading for a meltdown, just take away the tears
I’m suffocating, don’t leave me here waiting

Over and over in my head, I see your scars
Remember the day when we first met, take me back

I want to go back to the place, take me back to the place
Take me back, I want to go back
Take me, take me back

Before, never let go
Before I fold
Before never let go
Before I fold

You know that I am heading for a meltdown, controlling me losing it all
You know that I am heading for a meltdown, just take away the tears
I’m suffocating, don’t leave me here waiting

Meltdown, for a meltdown, meltdown
