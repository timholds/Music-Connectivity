[Intro]
Good morning, good morning, good morning...

[Verse 1]
I just came back from the other side
From the black wild world, all colours run dry
And all my demons feels like
They've disappeared tonight
Like I just broke into the morning light

[Chorus]
You bring me to life
You bring me to life, you
Now the world looks so damn beautiful
And you've opened up my eyes
Bring me to life, you

[Verse 2]
I just came out of the darkest night
Where strangers got me hypnotised oh
No one gets out of here alive
But today's not the day, not the day that I die

[Chorus]
You bring me to life
You bring me to life, you
Now the world looks so damn beautiful
And you've opened up my eyes
Bring me to life, you

[Bridge]
And all my demons
Feels like they've disappeared tonight
No, today's not the day, not the day that I die

[Outro]
You bring me to life
You bring me to life, you
Now the world looks so damn beautiful
And you've opened up my eyes
Bring me to life, you
