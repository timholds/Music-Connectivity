[Verse 1]
Marigolds are very much in love, but he doesn’t mind
Picking up his sister, he makes his way into the seas or land
All the way
She smiles

[Hook]
She goes up while he goes down, down

[Verse 2]
Sits on a stick in the river
Laughter in his sleep
Sister’s throwing stones, hoping for a hit
He doesn’t know so then

[Hook]
She goes up while he goes down, down

[Verse 3]
Another time, aaah
Another day, aaah
A brother’s way to leave
Another time, aaah
Another day, aaah
She’ll be selling plastic flowers on a Sunday afternoon
Picking up weeds, she hasn’t got the time to care
All can see he’s not there

[Hook 2]
She grows up for another man, and he’s down

[Outro]
Another time, another day
A brother’s way to leave
Another time, another day
Another time, another day
A brother’s way to leave
