Oh I know
I can feel the shifting in my bones
Enclosed are the senses so unknown
I've been changing, falling, fading
There's demons at the door patiently waiting

But I wasn't composed of broken bones or demon limbs
So please watch over me and be the light to carry me
Please be the light that carries me

I can feel it being torn from my hands; my innocence
This change is all so permanent
Can't you see the change in me?
I said it's all so permanent

There's no placement
No arrangement
Of words that I could say to keep these changes away

But I wasn't composed of broken bones or demon limbs
So please watch over me and be the light to carry me
Please be the light that carries me

This world is a masterpiece
I canvas sheet accountable for such losses
Shout out to the artist who took his heart and his soul and lost them both in the process

If it gets ahold of me
Please be the saint to save me
So please watch over me and be the light to carry me
