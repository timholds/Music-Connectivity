[Verse 1: Juicy J]
I got some killers so don't push me, Juicy J be on some mob shit
Waiting by your doorstep, hidin' in the bushes (mhmm)
If it comes down to it, ain’t no thang but to do it
Got a vest on, got a gun that can really do it
You niggas playin' with real niggas' money, get fronted
One day you is the plug, next day you’re in the dumpster
Couldn’t keep it one hundred, you’re thirty-two percent
The police got you on a leash, nigga you a bitch

[Hook: Juicy J]
Give yo' ass that body work nigga we spraying
Ridin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking bout the Klan
This ain’t no arcade, nigga so quit playing
It’s eating time, me and my niggas buffeting
Give yo' ass that body work, nigga we spraying
Ridin' with three K's nigga I ain't talking bout the Klan
This ain’t no arcade, nigga so quit playing!
It’s eating time, me and my niggas buffeting

[Verse 2: Pusha T]
You don’t know about this life, nigga
Earning all of these stripes, nigga
Kilograms, Peter Pans
Pack holders on bikes, nigga
Throwin bitches on flights, nigga
They ain't know that they're dykes, nigga
'Til the money’s out and the bottle's pouring
They’re in the midst of they life, nigga
Rose gold on my wrist, this Rolex like Devil's piss
This Daytona illuminate, y'all think I'm talking that devil shit
This's fifty racks, no bezel shit
Like blood diamonds, it’s rebel shit
This more guns, this more bodies
We call shots, they nobodies
They fuck niggas, they owe prolly
Who's fuckin with me? Nobody
When the guns drawn, they’re so sorry
Spraying niggas now the Lord got 'em
Bullets out the barrel make your body jerk
Fuck with my money and I’ll hit you that body work

[Hook: Juicy J]

[Verse 3: Meek Mill]
Bad bitches on deck, nigga
Money, power, respect, nigga
Cop, cook, collect, nigga
You was never no threat, nigga
Everybody be rap dissin'
I catch niggas, I check niggas
These goons with me don't spit no verse
Just limo service, they stretch niggas
Black 'maro 2 S nigga
Couple birds on my neck, nigga
Everytime them hoes see me
They like, "Meek Milly you a mess, nigga"
2 gats, no vest, nigga
Strapped up like i’m a cowboy
Stand tall like that Yao boy
Got a bad bitch, she 5"4
This gold roley thats on my wrist
Leprechaun prolly die for
Young boys that's on my strip
They'll kill anything I say ride on
Tell them niggas call us if they're out of work
Cause we lifting weights but we don't do no body work

[Hook: Juicy J]

[Verse 4: French Montana]
Shout my lawyer all the crazy shit I ever did
Know we love that KK sound
You know we not backing down
100 drum like, "Hold that doe"
Diamonds flash like Kodak, though
Straight cash, nigga fuck that loan
Seven digits on that phone
Money so long, smoke a whole zone
Getting blood money, tryna put my cuz on
Bitch I’m on fire, got my jaw wired
Sex, money, murder - Peter Rollack (Soundview, whaddup)
Body work, chopper work like a techno song
Twenty thou' a show, I just hope my nigga Max come home (wavey)
Money fast, diamonds flash like high beams
Make it rain in this bitch - Hurricane Irene
