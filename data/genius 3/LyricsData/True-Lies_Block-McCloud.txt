[Intro: "Network" movie dialogue]
I want you to get mad!
I don't want you to protest, I don't want you to riot
I don't want you to write to your congressman
Because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write
I don't know what to do about the depression
And the inflation and the Russians and the crime on the street
All I know is that first you've got to get mad!
You've got to say "I'm a human being, God damnit! My life has value!"

[Block McCloud]
Start the uprisin
We'll start the uprisin
It's time to uprise {*2X*}

[Block McCloud]
Listen people they got us believin we nothin but heathens
Screamin hatin each other for nothin but breathin
Hatin each other for color and creed when, me and you
We one and the same under the blade you cut and you bleed
And they think we dumb and naive, but we wasn't conceived yesterday
We know that AIDS they made up the disease
And they tease us with money and greed and make us hunger and feed
Off each other like some bloodsuckin freaks
And the most ignorant nigga's a publisher's dream
Nothin but whores and infidelity is up on the screen
Real chance of love with a slut and a creep, a lover that cheats
These dumb broads should be runnin the streets
If you think that lettin your daughters watchin +Charm School+
Won't harm you or her in the long run you're a darn fool
It's so blatant how they rapin our minds
In plain sight takin our rights, dignity, it ain't right

[Hook: repeat 2X]
Let's start the uprisin; it's time to cut ties
With these fuckin guys that's feedin us nothin but lies
It's time to uprise; rise up time's up
Cause when the trust dies, love dies, like government spies

[Vinnie Paz]
I'll admit that Obama had me believin the hype
But after doin the knowledge I ain't been sleepin at night
Probably the biggest deception I ever seen in my life
If y'all don't read between the lines then y'all ain't readin it right
Yeah~! Vinnie Paz just a motherfuckin trooper steppin
Nuclear anxiety and the code of the super weapon
Obama and Bush cousins and that's a true connection
Seizin power and property like a ruthless henchman
I'm in the Jewish temple on Mount Zion
Studyin literature from the Priory of Sion
Nothing's safe, no cars, no planes to fly on
I got a few bulletproof vests to try on
Yeah - but y'all can just remain the machine
It's true lies but I decide to stay on my deen
You a sucker if you think that the economy killed
Barack Obama 666 finally revealed

[Hook]
