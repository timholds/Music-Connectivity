[Verse 1]
I've been living on truck stop coffee
Cigarettes and vitamin C
It's a wonder that the devil ain't caught me
I guess he's tired of playing hide-n-seek
I've been driving like I'm struck by lighting
I think about you and I start to speed
I might as well be playing with matches
In a truckload of gasoline

[Chorus]
If it's the last thing I do
If it takes me from Tupelo to Timbuktu
If it's the last thing I do
I'm going to dodge every roadblock
Speed trap and county cop
To get my hands on you
If it's the last thing I do

[Verse 2]
Box of chicken and a day old biscuit
Ain't nothing left but a few old bones
I out to stop but I'm going to risk it
Caffeine got me chewing Styrofoam
Girl I'm calling out of Kansas City
From a filling station telephone
Just had to tell you what I've been thinking
First thing I want to do when I get home

[Chorus]

[Hook]
Yeah I've been driving like I'm struck by lighting
I think about you and I start to speed
I might as well be playing with matches
In a truckload of gasoline

[Chorus]

[Outro]
If it's the last thing I do[x3]
I'm going to dodge every roadblock
Speed trap and country cop to get my hands on you
Dodge every roadblock, s
Speed trap and country cop to get my hands on you
I'm going to dodge every roadblock
Speed trap and country cop to get my hands on you
