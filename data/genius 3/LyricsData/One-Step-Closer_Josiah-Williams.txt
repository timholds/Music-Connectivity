[Verse One:]
One word is all I need to work the courage up to do a show
A motivational mission, that word is “Go”
Common said it while back with many meanings
But, mine is simply a slight push for steady dreaming
Battle of the bands, holding a mic
Rapping lyrics from my heart 11:30 in the night
PM, for me, stands for Push More
Achieving the same high Wiz Khalifa uses the kush for
But, instead of me blowing life through white clouds
I’m blowing steam in a mic after I write down
All of my thoughts and hope that you’ll appreciate them
My lyrical recitals are written in brain, verbatim
I’m attracted to intellectual reason
So, smart thinking sets the mind state appease
God knows what’s best and I believe that
Now inhale the wisdom and breathe back
Exhale

[Verse Two:]
Take away my chance to dance and I’m inactive
I sit back and wonder can I get back into what I value, what I prize?
My personal progression
My own communication
My personal expression
Taking my education and move in a new direction
If I stumble and I fall then I call it a life lesson
The story of my life is only missing a page
Hoping to take all of my life skills and put them on the stage
And when the light shines down, I’m reaching for the stars
I’m not dreaming of gleaming of being in any cars
I’m showing that I’m driven, focused and determined
Imagine that I’m preaching to the classroom like a sermon
I believe that these are artists, not ordinary teachers
Who want me to perform instead of sitting on the bleachers
It’s much more than visual; this is all inside
I breathe art in hope of keeping it alive

[Verse Three:]
Who are you to tell me that I’m not going to make it?
These thoughts are a burden, I’m not going to take it
They can call me sensitive, I’ll be real and accept it
I just can’t become a thought that I had once neglected
I’m still the same and I will not tolerate hate
That’s a contradiction that I’m ready to negate
Respect. God knows what’s best. I believe that
Now inhale the wisdom and breathe back
Exhale
