At times I sit all by myself and wonder
Why do I love you
Like I do

All the love you given me so special
Seems to be no limit
I'll do anything

Why does the rain blow
Why does the sunshine
Why does the rain fall, down on my face
Why does the earth spin
Why do the waters reach the shore
And tell me, tell me why why

Why do I love you like I do?
