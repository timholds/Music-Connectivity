Lust for life
Lust for life
Lust for life

Here comes Johnny in again
With liquor and drugs
And a flash machine
He's gonna do another strip tease
Ah, hey man, where'd ya get that lotion?
I've been hurting since I bought the gimmick
About something called love
Yeah, something called love
Well, that's like hypnotising chickens
I'm just a modern guy
Huh, of course, I've had it in the ear before

I have a lust for life
Cause I've a lust for life
Lust for life (ooh)
Lust for life
Lust for life

I'm worth a million in prizes
With my torture film
Drive a GTO
I wear a uniform
On a government loan
I'm worth a million in prizes
Yeah, I'm through with sleeping on the sidewalk
No more beating my brains
No more beating my brains
With liquor and drugs
With liquor and drugs
Ooh, I'm just a modern guy
Huh, of course, I've had it in the ear before

And I've a lust for life (lust for life)
Cause I've a lust for life (lust for life)
A lust for life (ooh)
A lust for life
Lust for life (ooh)
I got a lust for life
Lust for life (ooh)
Ah a lust for life
Lust for life (ooh)
Lust for life
Lust for life

I'm just a modern guy
Huh, of course, I've had it in the ear before

And I've a lust for life (lust for life)
Cause I've a lust for life (lust for life)
A lust for life (ooh)
Lust for life
Lust for life (ooh)
Lust for life
Lust for life (ooh)
I got a lust for life
Lust for life (ooh)
I got a lust for life
A lust for life
