[Hook: Angel]
Even though you don't know
Even though you don't know
Even though you don't know my name
Me and you bleed exactly the same
I smile and come across I'll tame
A hundred volts take your life ain't no game
I switch them lights off
Hey DJ turn them lights off

[Verse 1: Wiley]
She got her light switched on
My light's switched on
She looking in my eyes like 'I like this don'
I wanna know what side she's from
I seen many girls but I like this one
Told me she was a west side lady
Had a few friends but they were all shady
Now she on a solo ting
So nobody can't send her crazy
Too many friends, and not enough true friends
Made her wanna go and move to new ends
I care though, cause even if my life gets lonely
It's all good, to keep few friends

[Pre-Hook: Wiley]
We connected I asked her out and she accepted
I think she gets it
When the end of the night comes
Me and her leave through the exit

[Hook: Angel]
Even though you don't know my name
Me and you bleed exactly the same
I smile and come across all tame
A hundred volts take your life ain't no game
I switch them lights off
Hey DJ, turn them lights off

[Verse 2: Wiley]
Anywhere we go, we bound to have fun
You take care of me we gettin' the job done
She keeps my mind calm, getting alot done
I know it's all new but it feels so long
On first sight I wanted to be acquainted
People gonna see us out clocking that we dated
And we don't know where we even wanna take it
But we got it good bond I don't wanna break it

[Pre-Hook: Wiley]
We connected
I asked her out and she accepted
I think she gets it
When the end of the nights comes
Me and her leave through the exit

[Hook: Angel]

[Verse 3: Tinchy Stryder]
Turn the lights on, Beyonce
Well, you're not quite there, but I must say
I like them pushing off face
Young black and a tax and that rip cage
That sexy dress the only part that's revealing yes
That's why I'm respecting her
Rejecting them and selecting her, Strydes

[Break: Wiley]
Anywhere we go we're bound to have fun
You take care of me, we gettin' the job done

[Angel]
I switch them lights off
Hey DJ turn them lights off

[Wiley]
When the end of the nights comes
Me and her leave for the exit
