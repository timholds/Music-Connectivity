Wait, you got that look in your face
Like there's some kind of mistake
I can't keep waiting for change
When something's been misplaced
You know who I want you to be
You never wanted to stay
I wasn't willing to wait

I lost my faith
I lost my faith
When you fell asleep, asleep
I lost my faith
Well I lost my faith
When you fell asleep, asleep

We'll let go
From holding onto the rope
Searching for something to hold
Yeah I just wanted to know
Suffocate your bones
Suffocate your soul
I let you til' you grow old
I let you out in the cold

I'm wide awake
I'm home
I'm home
I'm fine alone, alone
I'm home
Run home
I feel fine alone, alone

A lie, I could see it in your smile
I could see it in your eyes
I could see it in your eyes
I could see it in your eyes
I could see it in your eyes
