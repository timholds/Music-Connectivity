[Verse 1]
Tell me, what's the use
Of a twenty-four inch waist
If you don't touch me?
Tell me, what's the use again
Of being on TV every day
If you don't watch me?

[Pre-Chorus]
This house is full of emptiness
My closet's full of dresses
That I'll never wear
My life is full of people
But you're my only friend
My best friend

[Chorus]
Hope it isn't too late to say "I love you"
Hope it isn't too late to say
That without you this place looks like London
It rains every day
Don't you know it, babe?
I'm only half a body
Without your embrace

[Verse 2]
Let me tell you why
My heart is an unfurnished room
Any suggestions?
Don't have to tell you more than that
'Cause no one knows me like you do
Without exception

[Pre-Chorus]
This house is full of emptiness
My closet's full of dresses
That I'll never wear
My life is full of people
But you're my only friend
My best friend

[Chorus]
Hope it isn't too late to say "I love you"
Hope it isn't too late to say
That without you this place looks like London
It rains every day
Don't you know it, babe?
I'm only half a body
Without your embrace
Hope it isn't too late to say "I love you"
Hope it isn't too late to say
That without you this place looks like London
It rains every day
Don't you know it, babe?
I'm only half a body
Without your embrace
