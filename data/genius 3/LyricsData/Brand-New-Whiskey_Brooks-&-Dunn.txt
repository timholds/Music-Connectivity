[Chorus]
Yeah they ought to make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's name
A man needs something to hold onto
When a goodbye hits him like a hurricane
Make it sweet, as sweet as her lips
Something special like champagne
Yeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's name

[Verse]
Leaving's the reason I'm drinking
Oh I've never felt so alone
Night and day I stay stoned
Hoping to forget she's gone
I never thought she'd do me so dirty
Together forever she promised me
She took her promise and left a memory
The day the woman walked out on me

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah they oughta make a brand new whiskey
And give it a woman's name
