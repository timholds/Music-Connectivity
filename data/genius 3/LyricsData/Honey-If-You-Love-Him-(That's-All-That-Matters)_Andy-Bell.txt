I've got a new man for you
This one I say is true blue
Blue eyes and responsibilities
I intro you do the rest
You've made a fast recovery
Is this Sunday evening too soon?
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
What he put you through truth is he was so far beneath you
Honey if you're happy that's all that matters
Oh I've got to confess your ex was a hot mess
Honey if you love him
If you love him
Honey if you love him
If you love him
Honey if you love him
If you love him
Honey if you love him
I keep some old shoes around
I forget how much I paid for them
But they do look good
They hurt if I walk off ten metres
Make me look slimmer and taller
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
What he put you through truth is he was so far beneath you
Honey if you're happy that's all that matters
Oh I've got to confess your ex was a hot mess
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
Oh I know how it goes in one ear and out the other
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
We're just easily taken 'cause we're easily flattered
Honey if you love him
If you love him
Honey if you love him
If you love him
Honey if you love him
If you love him
Honey if you love him
Honey if you love him
If you love him
Honey if you love him
If you love him
Honey if you love him
If you love him
Honey if you love him
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
What he put you through truth is he was so far beneath you
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
Oh I've got to confess your ex was a hot mess
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
Oh I know how it goes in one ear and out the other
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
We're just easily taken 'cause we're easily flattered
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
Honey if you love him that's all that matters
