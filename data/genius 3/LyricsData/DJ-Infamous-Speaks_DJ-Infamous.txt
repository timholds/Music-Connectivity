Theres one thing you gotta know about the A-Town KRIT, that's the motherfucking strip club. Big shots (?), Magic City, Goosebumps, Strokers, Foxy Lady, you can't come to the A-Town without going to the strip clubs! But the hottest shit of them all? Is when you go to the back room and get that private dance on. You feel me? See Me On Top Vol. III, pay the fuckin' tention, Club Blaze!
