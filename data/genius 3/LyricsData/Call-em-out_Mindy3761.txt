Back the shooter
You'll see shit rise
Nothing can justify
Call him out
He's in the hood
When shits bad
Don't protect
Fake good
Shooting cops revenge
Watch the nation
Now  become unhinged
Please don't eat
This cake batter
The powers that be
Will just get fatter
This is not the way to peace
But its the perfect way
For national grief
Pull together in the hood
Pull out the shit
Up it to good
I don't understand why
We are the same
We share this world
It's the only game
Is this justice?
No it's not
But right now
It's all we got
