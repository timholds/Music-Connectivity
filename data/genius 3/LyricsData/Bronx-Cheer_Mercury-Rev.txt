Have you seen her running 'round (have you seen her)
And the way she wears her hair (running 'round)
If you see her out tonight (have you seen her)
Tell her I don't care (running 'round)
Tell her I don't care (running 'round)
Have you heard she's coming down (have you seen her)
With every sickness in the air (running 'round)
If you see her out tonight (have you seen her)
Tell her I don't care (running 'round)
Tell her I don't care
Tell her I don't care (running 'round)
I don't care
I don't care
(kumbaya, kumbaya, have you seen her, let her know)
And if you get alone let her know that I don't really care
And if you get alone let her know that I don't really care
Have you seen her running 'round
And the way she wears her hair
If you see her out tonight
Tell her I dont care
Tell her I dont care
Tell her I dont care
Tell her I dont care
I don't care
I don't care
(kumbaya, kumbaya, kumbaya)
