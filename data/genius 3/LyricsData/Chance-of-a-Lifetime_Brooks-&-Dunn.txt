[Verse 1]
I came staggering in, in the middle of the night
I got my alibi sewed up nice & tight
Cracked the bedroom door, I tried to keep it from squeaking
'Cause I know there's a wildcat in there sleeping
But the, the light was on & the bed was made
And there's a dear john written on the pillow case

[Chorus]
She said I've gone to the Bahamas
I've had it with the drama
Time to get out of town
I'm just a slowing you down
She said I found somebody that likes
The things that you used to
Yeah & he's got a lot of money
We're going where it's sunny
& baby he's a looker too
She said it was a chance of a lifetime
What was I supposed to do

[Verse 2]
Oh yeah, I woke up this morning in a terrible mess
I had the telephone ringing & her cat on my chest
I'm wiping the sleep out of my bloodshot eyes
It's gotta be her calling to apologize
She must be feeling bad 'cause she done me wrong
Then I pushed the button on the code-a-phone

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh & I got the stereo
And she got the music
Yeah & I got this washer
But I don't know how to use it

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh yeah, it was a chance of a lifetime
What was I supposed to do
Maybe you can come get this cat
