[Chorus:]
Please dry your eyes, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
It's not your fault, young girl
Don't cry, you're beautiful
You're not the one to blame
Soon it will be okay
One day you'll realize
Your beauty

It was a Saturday
This cold afternoon
Inside this house there
Lived a frightened young girl

She didn't know what she should do
Cause she missed her mother so
She was left home all alone
With her stepfather

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 2:]
He touched her places
That he shouldn't have touched
He did some things to her
That he shouldn't have done
So she ran into her room
Paged her mother 9-1-1
And the tragedy began
For this young girl

She told her mother
Her family and friends
No one believed her
Cause before this happened
She was filled with hate and anger
Towards her step father
Cause he took her mother from her
When they married

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Verse 3:]
She looked for her father
In the men that she saw
Thought that all she had to offer
Was her body
No one to figure out why
This young girl would live her life
In such pain and unhappiness
She was so beautiful

She rebelled and
One day the young girl fell in love
With another man like her stepdad
He abused her emotionally
And made her feel like
She was worthless
Hope one day she realize
And see the beauty in her eyes
All she needs is
Prayer and strength
She's beautiful

[Repeat Chorus 2x:]

Don't hold your head down low
You've got so much, so much
So much, so much
So much to be proud of
You can still live your life
I promise you
You'll survive
Girl I love you
You're beautiful
