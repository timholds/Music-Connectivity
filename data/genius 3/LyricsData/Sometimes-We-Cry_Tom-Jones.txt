Sometimes we know
Sometimes we don't
Sometimes we give
And sometimes we won't

Sometimes we're strong
And sometimes we're wrong
Sometimes we cry
Sometimes we cry

Sometimes it's bad
When the going gets tough
Help me look in the mirror
Help me wanna give up

Sometime you know leave it
Want to try
Sometimes we cry

Well we gonna have to sit down
And think it through
Yeah, if we only hear them
What more can we do

The only thing to do
Is eat humble of pie
Sometimes we cry
Sometimes we cry

For they put me in a jacket (For they put me in a jacket)
Take me away (Take me away)
I ain't gonna fake it (I ain't gonna fake it)
Not like Johny Ray ( Not like Johny Ray)

Sometimes we live (Sometimes we live)
Sometimes we die (Sometimes we die)
Sometimes we cry (Sometimes we cry)

Sometimes we can't (Sometimes we can't)
See everything straight (See everything straight)
Sometimes everybody ( Sometimes everybody)
Is on the make (Is on the make)
Sometimes we cry (Sometimes we cry)

For they put me in a jacket (For they put me in a jacket)
Take me away (Take me away)
I ain't gonna fake it (I ain't gonna fake it)
Not like Johny Rain ( Not like Johny Rain)

Sometimes we live (Sometimes we live)
Sometimes we die (Sometimes we die)
Sometimes we cry (Sometimes we cry)

Sometimes we live (Sometimes we live)
Sometimes we die (Sometimes we die)
Sometimes we cry (Sometimes we cry)

(There we go) Sometimes we live (Sometimes we live)
Sometimes we die (Sometimes we die)
Sometimes we cry

Sometimes we live (Sometimes we live)
Sometimes we die (Sometimes we die)
Sometimes we cry (Sometimes we cry)
