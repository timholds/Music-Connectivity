Rewind
Everything I said
Is there time
To take it all back now?
Was I
Better off alone?
My wings
Burning in the flames
Flying
Straight into the pain
I'm losing control

If only I'd seen this coming
(Coming)
If only I had known
That you could sink so low
That you could be so cold
Seen this coming
(Coming)
When we met that day
I would have walked away
If only I'd seen this coming

Thinking
Has never been easy
Drinking
Is better than leaving
I'm king
Of learning how to cope
I'm sideways
Slipping through something
Bad days
Are better than nothing
Running out of hope

If only I'd seen this coming
(Coming)
If only I had known
That you could sink so low
That you could be so cold
Seen this coming
(Coming)
When we met that day
I would have walked away
If only I'd seen this

Some days I just get too sober
And I lose my mind
I lose my mind
Some things I just can't get over
But it'll be alright
It'll be alright

I'm losing control

If only I'd seen this coming
(Coming)
If only I had known
That you could sink so low
That you could be so cold
Seen this coming
(Coming)
When we met that day
I would have walked away
If only I'd seen this coming

You could sink so low
You could be so cold
If I'd seen this coming
If only
I would have walked away
If only I'd seen this coming

If only I'd seen this coming
