Bare steel, don't fuck around, it's a square deal
You might wake up hair peeled next to the spare wheel
See my words are on point with this razor edge tongue
When i say i reach for the lead, i mean a pencil son

If i told you i dropped knowledge i ain't kill a teacher, though
I walk the streets alone, freezing soon i'm leaving home
Escaping trust issues and drugs misused you must excuse
-the fact that i don't fuck with you's

My occupation is hip hop, with homicide on the side
And i remain original and never compromised
You signed the rights to your rhymes on the dotted line
As dollar signs lit up like neon signs across your eyes

-ain't nobody exempt from me
My rhymes are so pretty they could resurrect and tempt Ghandi
I get smarmy like a bastard till the masses looking at me
-you faggots fish out of water lets hope your hook is catchy

Keeping my head keep a collection of heads blasting cats
All in my head, dollars and bread classic grandmaster caz
No label signing me if i's wearing a plaster cast-
But they bending down to do it if you got a plastic ass

A weight watcher will take off, before you take me in a
Face off last taste of a battle-
I ate the guys face off on a plate with steak sauce
Kicked his skateboard and made him hit the road like Ray Charles

Strap me in the chair, and get the bolts tightened
Pull the lever volts heighten, suddenly jolts of lightning
Are striking and brewing a storm, at two in the morn same time as when i was
Screwing your mom, no for real we was shooting a porn

Guess ill expect a suing along with a few hundred all in a furious mob-
Tryna ruin mah lawn, like why you doing this Chronic you ruined this song
-wait, did i just say that shit? maybe i'm batshit crazy
-and like fat chicks a heavy habit plagues me (heh)




I ain't just making better shit
Off course i'm raising the bar, but i'm beating you round the head with it
Fuck censorship cause I dont censor shit
Swearing like Tourettes plus i'm influenced by Freestyle Fellowship

Absent without leave with a bottle of absinthe
Lost my free will after the tenth refill
With each step its like i'm on a steep hill but can't keep still
-still make brothers look bad like the sister of meek mill

I got genital warts and also im bleeding piss
Had so much heated sex
I've probably got more kids than DMX
-beat a faggot rapper 'til they seeing dicks cause voices
Speak in my ears and they never leave like a freaking itch

So many endorphins coursing from what i'm snorting
I'm causing  your life to shorten more than an orphaned abortion
So I stuff your glasses in your throat cause you need to watch what you're talking
When my mixtape assisted more suicides than Jack Kevorkian
