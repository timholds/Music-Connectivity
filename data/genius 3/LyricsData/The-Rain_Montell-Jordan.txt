(Intro)
Listen
Shh..
You hear that?
Can you hear that?
Listen

Ohh, ohh, ohh

Lying in my bedroom next to me
Nervous like a child playing hide and seek
I never knew how fast that your heart could beat
It's like it's your first time

But now that your intentions have been revealed
You wanna feel what lovers feel
There's no need to pretend if you don't know how
I'm gonna show you now

1 - Just say what you're feeling
Your secret is safe with me
Tell me your deepest thoughts
Whisper your fantasies
My love will never stop
I'll kiss you as every drop
Of the rain drops down

No, you're not dreaming
This is reality
More than you bargained for
All that you'll ever need
Everytime you come
It's like heaven opens up
And the rain comes down

First you'll feel all warm and tingly
Right before your legs start trembling
And you explode, from your head to your toes
You're feeling something that you never felt before

Together we'll experience the warmth inside
Until the very moment that we both arrive
You'll scream, shake and cry
Feeling so remarkable, it's hard to describe

Repeat 1

Yeah, yeah, yeah

Making love in the rain
Losing ourselves in the storm again
Goin' everywhere
This is the closest that we'll ever come to heaven
Ahh

No you're not dreaming
Don't be afraid
This is the way we're gonna stay
No you're not dreaming
I'll keep your secret for as long as I am living (?)

Repeat 1 w/ad-libs to fade
