Called you yesterday
You didn't answer your phone
The main drag is knowing that
You probably weren't alone

So here I sit in my lonely room
Lookin' for my sunshine
But all I've got is two cigarettes
And this broken heart of mine

So let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down

You've been gone 17 days
17 long nights
The main drag is knowing that
You're holding someone else tight

I wanna to call you everyday
And beg you to be near me
But I know your head is underwater
I doubt that you could hear me

So let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down

Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
17 Days
Ha, ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
17 Days

Called you yesterday
You didn't answer your phone
If you're the one who's always lonely
Then I'm the one who's always alone

So here I sit in my lonely room
Lookin' for my sunshine
All I've got is two cigarettes
And this broken heart of mine

Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down

Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down

Why don't you answer your phone?

Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
17 Days

Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down
Let the rain come down, down
17 Days
