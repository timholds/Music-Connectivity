[Verse 1]
Been a long time, in a low place
Surrounded by what I have made
Need to get away
Get away from what relates
And what was done

Cuz it's all over now

Through the woods, I come running to loose leaf
And carve my name
In the lines, there's not a trace
I hear the ghost whisper, and those old eyes watching me
But I feel safe...

Grandfather looking over me

[Chorus]
He said:
"Don't make them wait
Gotta go a long way
Let's be brave
Don't make them wait
Nah, don't make them wait"

[Verse 2]
I sat down, with a coffee on my bent knee
Looking out, at the burnt land, looking back at me
These used to be green crops
And high on a summer breeze
Now it's fallow fields and clear-cut barren weeds
They said that if I stared
The abyss would stare back at me
So I did...
And I felt it slowly creep in me
Save for the smoke, that danced when I took a drag
It made me think about the way it all came to be...

Grandmama watching over me

[Chorus]
And she said
"Don't make them wait
Gotta go a long way
Let's be brave, show them the way
Nah, don't make them wait"

[Bridge]
Don't make them wait, nah
Don't make them wait

[Outro]
I hear the ghost whisper
And those old eyes watching me
But I feel safe
I feel safe
