[Verse 1]
Comfort me, oh comfort me
I'm lighting up
To see the day you run for me
You run for me, my love

Take a peek, oh take a peek
Inside my head
I promise you
I'm not so scared
I'm not so scared at all

[Pre-Chorus]
But I've been sat up
For days
And I've been thinking of the things that you've said
And I've been wound up
Each way
I need to let you know
To let you know today

[Chorus]
You call me a liar
You call me so innocent
But you lit the fire
You lit the fire that burns
Inside us
I'm not innocent
I lit the fire

[Verse 2: PVRIS]
Comfort me, oh comfort me
I'm lighting up
To see the day you fall for me
You fall for me, my love

Take a peek, oh take a peek
I'm standing tall
To try and see the final spark
Of you and me, my love

[Pre-Chorus: PVRIS]
But I've been sat up
For days
And I've been thinking of the things that you've said
And I've been wound up
Each way
I need to let you know today

[Chorus: PVRIS]
You call me a liar
You call me so innocent
But you lit the fire
You lit the fire that burns
Inside us
I'm not innocent
I lit the fire

You call me a liar
You call me so innocent
But you lit the fire
You lit the fire that burns
Inside us
I'm not innocent
I lit the fire
