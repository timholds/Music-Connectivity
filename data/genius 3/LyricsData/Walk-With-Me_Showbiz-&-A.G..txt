[Hook]
They always walk with me everyday
Cautiously I move, a part of me in every way
One is who I was the other is who I want to be these niggas won't budge
They influence my decisions, and I can't help but listen

[Verse 1]
Strive for excellence but demons are negligent
Every since a boy always knew I was heaven sent
For evidence, hidden in my treasure chest
My ivory tower you'll never find me cower
Struck by lightning so electric call me powder
Sour-power puff the loud turn it louder
Search for truth on my mental browser
Life's a bitch but I'm really glad I found her
Shit I better be
I'm trying to better me
She's moving so fast I can see she's way ahead of me
I slow it down or pick it up
Either way we see eye to eye no I'd never give it up
I'm half-man half-amazing
She half-Asian half-Haitain with a bit of Caucasian
Ready for the world need a little more patience
Mugshot Music get em' all anxious

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
So much I want to see, so much I've seen
Touch the screen made love to my dream
Now I'm in it for the spinach
Minus all the gimmicks, yeah nigga
Lets talk about business
Proceed with no seed, music is my legacy
Take my body leave the rest of me
Showing they chemistry, gourmet recipe
From the X call me ecstasy
They standing right next to me, one pushing, one pulling
One would, one wouldn't, they apart of who I am
And they push me to the limit always know that I can
It's the three man weave, and I'm fucking with greatness
Watch what we conceive
Never looking back cept when I took it back
Blue-and-white knight dunks nigga look at that

[Hook]
