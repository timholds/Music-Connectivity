You're reaching out in the dead of night
Searching for my hand
You know I'm there in the waste of shadows
I'm your pain and friend

I hear your silent cries
I'm the shade in the shadows
I know your secret lies
I'm the shade in the shadows

I ban the light and I leave you blind
If you try your eyes
I am enemy or a trusty fellow
In your wailing mind

I hear your silent cries
I'm the shade in the shadows
I know your secret lies
I'm the shade in the shadows
I hide behind your shame
I'm the shade in the shadows
Crying out loud your name
I'm the shade in the shadows
The shade in the shadows of you

There I cry for you – in the shadows
As I always do – in the shadows
You may oust me there - in the shadows
But I'm always there – in the shadows – in the shadows

I hear your silent cries
I'm the shade in the shadows
I know your secret lies
I'm the shade in the shadows
I hide behind your shame
I'm the shade in the shadows
Crying out loud your name
I'm the shade in the shadows
The shade in the shadows of you

There I cry for you – in the shadows
(I'm the shade in the shadows)
As I always do – in the shadows
(I'm the shade in the shadows)
The shade in the shadows of you
