[Verse 1]
Came home last night, there was fire and smoke on the TV
Cops and the army, people running out in the street looting
I took off my clothes, and came four times
Could not leave myself alone

[Chorus]
It was porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros
Porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros

[Verse 2]
I got in my car, saw the fire and smoke, headed to it
Just for this night, I believe it is good to destroy it
Get back in the car, let's drive on by
Everybody bump and grind

[Chorus]
It was porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros
Porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros
It was porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros

[Bridge]
Oh, there's so much trouble
Oh, but I love it so much
Having the time of my life

[Chorus]
It was porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros
Porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros
It was porno for pyros, porno for pyros, porno for pyros
