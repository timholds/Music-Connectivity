[Hook]
Ar, Ar-Artillery
So its hard to get rid of me
Niggas say I'm a marked man but they ain't marking me physically
I'm a pace setter so I'm starting it instantly
Ar, Ar-Artillery
Ar, Ar-Artillery
Ar, Ar-Artillery
So its hard to get rid of me

[Verse 1]
Militant man with a brilliant plan
I might play it innocent hand
That's a William scam, but not only William can
Pull it off, I can pull off a trillion fam
No fluke, no incident, dont you ever think the only killer is Cam
I'm sicker with a stick than Sam
When he's chasing a buddy letting off a shotgun
There goes another hot one
Its curry woah,you better hurry home
Dumb-dumb sit in dummies bones
Unlucky homes, I'm old school like a runny nose
Strap on the stage when I spit
But I don't need that to duppy shows
And I'm nobodies hubby so
If you see me with a slutty ho
You know it's a quick one like 'come we go'
Back to the war
So many enemies on my case that I can't relax anymore
They're all talking nobody's telling me to my face
Maybe cos I'm carrying a sword
Deadman walking the cemetery awaits
I'm engaged to my gun so I'm marrying a whore
Non-stop letting off when I draw
Black bags outside like a charity store
But there ain't no clothes in them
Just bodies with holes in them
1, 2, 3 loads of them
4, 5, 6 casket closed for them
7, 8, 9 let me reload again, I'm stone cold
My face ain't got no emotion and
My foes know when I comes to the beef I'm sub-zero
Cos they're on a frozen ting
Hands in the air when the mandem appear
Sometimes I wake up like damn my career
I'm a Scorcher its a ransom affair
There ain't a man that I fear
Cos I can make a man disappear
For a grand, be aware
There's man that would do that; gladly
Keep going on like you don't actually care
And I swear they'll have your whole family scared
You'll see the insanity clear
Picture that like a gallery queer
Forsee the future
Or see the shooter
Surely remove ya
Brain out the back of your head
For feeling super
Like nothin can't dent Clark Kent
Well I'll be the type to attempt
I'm Lex Luther, I'll step to ya
World domination, get used to
The fact that I'm back and Ima let loose
An atomic bomb the size of St. Lucia
Wait that's an exaggeration
But when it comes to my gun its masterbation
Its bussing and if you dont know
I'll fill a nigga in like an application
This ain't American X
But its teeth on the curb, now smack the pavement
I'm going on like I can't wait to die:
Yeah well, I never had any patience
Man'll be waiting outside in the car
Niggas outside of ya yard
I got man parrallel, diagonal and adjacent
All angles
And I got tricks up my sleeve like big Paul Daniels
I don't give a shit how many niggas your with prick
They're all candles
I'll light 'em up like a lighter does
Your defence ain't saying one
Call Campbell, and Rio Ferdinand
But dont think that G won't murder man
I'm like fam this ain't an act its all actual
Shit that I've done, shit that I did
Shit that I'm gonna do, shit that I think
Some man are putting it on its not at all natural
Stop all the bad boy poses
None of you are bad boys
Bad boys know this
You can put a scar on your face and base in your voices
But we know you're still moist bitch
Beef I'd rather avoid it, its pointless, but I've been poisoned
By the manor I've been living in
Man are on the killing ting like we live where the oil is
My bloods boiling
Man wanna wet me up but I've already been anointed
So my only choice is:
Is take this shit like a toilet
Or go hard like a coin is
So now I'm in deep like oysters
I'm looking at certain man (what)
And I can see what the 'roids did
But I'm not gonna take that rout
Skinny nigga with an 8-pack, how? (how?)
Head to knees then lay back down
150 times a day...
It's hard to maintain that wow:
Pump up, tone up, weights in a gym
Gun buck a doughnut straight in the chin
Dumb fucks, roll up, waving a ting
One buss, hold up, blaze in the wind
Never hit anyone or anything
Never hit anything or anyone
Ok check 1, 2 gun to the head (bang)
Payback's a bitch (bang)
I ain't one to forget (bang)
So I'll spray that and split
When forensics got to the scene and saw the wounds
They said "It must be a tech"
Yeah, must be a tech
Names G-H and I'm fucked in the head
