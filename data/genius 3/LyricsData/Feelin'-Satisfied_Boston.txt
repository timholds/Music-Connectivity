[Verse 1]
Well come on
All you people
The time has come to get together
You gotta have a little rock 'n' roll music
To get you through the stormy weather
And do whatever you feel
When you let go
Nothing's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll

[Chorus]
So come on, put you hands together
You know it's now or never
Take a chance on rock 'n' roll

[Verse 2]
Ooo are you feeling satisfied
Come on let us give your mind a ride
Ooo are you ready tonight
Come on let us give your mind a ride You can do what you like
Come on let us give your mind a ride

[Verse 3]
Oh that funky feeling
Is what you need to get you through
You oughta know
I'll tell you something
Don't let your troubles get to you
Cause win or lose it's alright
Well take control
And nothing's gonna help you more than rock 'n' roll

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ooo are you feeling satisfied
Come on let us give your mind a ride
Ooo are you ready tonight
Come on let us give your mind a ride You can do what you like
Come on let us give your mind a ride
