Well I don't wanna go back home
And I don't want a kiss goodnight
Let's paralyze this moment 'till it dies
To the end of the earth
Under the Valley of the Stars
There's a car crashing deep inside my heart

Take a ride through the avenues
Across the Great Divide
There's a siren screaming "I'm alive"
It cries
Red alert is the color
Of your paper valentines
Intertwined on this moment passing by
Take a ride through the avenues
Across the Great Divide
There's a siren screaming "I'm alive"

It cries
Red alert is the color
Of your paper valentines
Intertwined on this moment passing by
Do you wanna be my valentine?
So come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines
Cigarettes and valentines!

So come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines
So come away with me tonight
With cigarettes and valentines
Cigarettes and valentines!
