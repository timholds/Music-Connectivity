[Hook]

If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time
Girl, I be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine

Please, say he's just a friend
Now girl, let's not pretend
Either he is or he ain't your man
Please, say he's just a friend

If I was your best friend
I want you 'round all the time
Girl, I be your best friend
If you promise you'll be mine

Please, say he's just a friend
Now girl, let's not pretend
Either he is or he ain't your man
Please, say he's just a friend
If I was your best friend

[Verse 1: Dee.Money]

If I Was Yo Bestfriend, Or Maybe Yo Next Man
Whould He Be The Mutant, Yo Make Him Yo X-Man?
You See That You Had Me, You Settled For Less Man
One Day You Gone Be Back, So Im Counting My Blessins
But Still In The Meanwhile, You Seem To Make Me Smile
I Used To Make You Smile, Remember Yo Lifestyle
Speaking Of Lifestyles, So How Is Yo Life Now
Remember How Close We Was, Why We Aruge & Fight Now?!
Yo Heart Is A Dark Whole, I Guess Im Yo Light Now
Before I Was Too Litte, I Guess Im Your Height Now
Shxt You Can Get Picked Up, But You Gone Get Pipe'ed Down
Tomorrow Is Today, So I Speaking On Right Now
& You Should Just Sit Back, & You Should Just Listen
& I Should Forget You, & Just Keep It Pimiping
I Never Could Jump Rope, Dats Why I Keep Tripping
But Shawty You My Diamond & You Never Stop Glistening
I Know That Your Man Broke, He Can't Pay Attention
He Can't Pay His Rent, He Beg For Extensions
Is This What You Want, I Pack What He Lack
Yo Man Say He Strapped.? You Think I Believe That!
I Used To Be Hustlin, Right Where The Streets At
& I Been Right Here, But You Could'nt See That
So Gimmie My Heart Back, Gimmie My Keys Back
& Bitch You So Spine-less So Please Dont Come Back.!
