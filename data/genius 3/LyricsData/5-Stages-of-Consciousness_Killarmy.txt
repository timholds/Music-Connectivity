Intro: Killa Sin, P.R. Terrrorist

Yeah, yeah, one, two, check it out, yo
5 stages of consciousness right here
You got your conscious, yeah know I'mean, word up
You got your sub-conscious
You got your super-conscious
You got your magnetic-conscious
And then we're infinite

*Various talk by both*

[Killa Sin]
Yo, I forever stay ready dunn
Money run gun under the pelly, kind of heavy
Pretty pearl, tickle my belly, but steady by the waist-line
Thirsty to dump but thought twice before I took time to waste
None un-mine in his swine, I let him live now hop he relizes what he did
Perhaps you've got a child on the line and I ain't got no time for no bid
See battle up to warn the squad, already bars on my crib
With their guns drawn, seekin Killa Sin who done slid
Many moons ago, across town whereabouts
Unknown heights blaring loud out, you, me like who gives a fuck
I puff a bone, a usual suspect, i'll never be
Allah sees everything, bad boy silence is the key to longevity
So, take this advice, while I reiterate the thought to take your life
And I will

[P.R. Terrrorist]
Magazines recovered at homo scenes, living of rhyming schemes
Always had dreams to be discovered and meanwhile had to blow trial
Not put in foul like the rest of them, seventeen with blade infected guns
Had to watch my back when I shit and piss, niggas busting nuts in COs
Leaving maternals frisked, faces derenched, buck 50 smile
Your face get lifted and then you shift into another facility
Same shit, back in the world, I stand strong and watch the weak curl
From the pressure of everyday life, career endeavor
The knowledge, sylabbles and my name is straight terror
Killarmy running through your whole fucking era
With five stages of consciousness, we swiftly change like the weather
And control forecast, rough traffic, off the pad, alive in the act
Your stuck to subjects just like math, ram you off in the first half
This quarter won't last, your leaning on the trigger, guns blast
Blaow, super-conscious leaves this track smashed

[Beretta 9]
Harpoons for hard times, kid, going through this difficult stage
Yet I maintain, coping with the stress and pain
Still in seek of the shelter that blocks the rain
Although you gone in the flesh, my mental contains
'Til the times we explain
The duty of a wise man, to the minds, some will blame
With this physical, mental, will and emotion
Realisations to control, to my infinite devotions
Which is to seek the unsaught, conceive/express thought
Teach the seeds the [wrong foods?], demanding what they not
Now ny duty is to civilize and penalize
Throats were cutting them, they must of got stregthalized
I take it upon myself to reveal the disguise
You fucking snake, I tie you to the graphite, tight
If now to live, you would begin to strike
I waste no time now searching for a mystery
With every twenty five thousand, we renew our history
We be the gods, the asiatic black men, and not reacting
We actually run this shit and defend

*martial art sample*

[Islord]
Aiyyo, three years trapped in the belly of the beast
Got me on some, fuck the laws, fuck the fed coats
Fuck the judge, cause they dont give two shits about us
Black man, woman and child, how were living over here
Trapped in the worst part, when things like this happen on the regular
Innocent bystanders get trapped off on the streets of my stomping grounds
With constant war pops off, wine bottles on the regular
Like clock work to be specific

[9th Prince]
The General Wise died in fatigues, mentally for life I bleed
And promise to feed his seeds, was the supreme general in the army
Little intelligent little bug, roll with thugs that sold drugs to survive
Civilized the eighty-fives and saved many lives
But these water-head niggas dealt with the four devils
Ceased the rebel and broke the god physically down to another level
Now I'm at his wake, the great general passed away
With a smile on his face, I swear if you was still here
These pussy niggas get tourtured, while I stick hooks up their noses
And cut of their ears, even their family members will have to pay
Brothers, mothers, sisters and fathers get manslaughtered the right way
I'm not dealing with feelings, but I'll spare the children
Weak niggas get destroyed, Real niggas is building
Revenge the general, thats what I quote duct tape up grenades to your head
And watch your brains explode

[Shogun Assasson]
Yo, yo, I sling war slang like cocaine
Verbal dope that numbs your brain
Like a shot of novacaine
In your death you will feel no pain
I should teach you with my sword
And the tip was poisonous
Snakes speak lies and their words is venomous
Wu hits come continous
So I don't give a fuck if Hot '97 Ain't feelin this
See what I'm revealin' is the truth
In actual facts be the proof
The youth be the fruits
And the elders be the roots
I stand solid, under firmament
This black man be the dominant intelligent
These be the words of my testament
Writen documents of the thought
That makes me give props and sell tapes like cashcrops
Mother fuckers
