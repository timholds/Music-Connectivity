[Hook]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone calls
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
Cause you a bug a boo
You bugging what? you bugging who? You bugging me!
And dont you see it ain't cool

[Verse 1]
It's not hot that you be calling me
Stressing me paging my beeper
You're just non-stop and its not hot
That you be leaving me messages every 10 minutes and then you stop by
When I first met you, you were cool
But it was game you had me fooled
Cause 20 minutes after I gave you my number
You already had my mailbox full

[Pre-Hook]
So what you bought a pair of shoes
What now I guess you think i owe you
You dont have to call as much as you do
I'd give them back to be through with you
And so what my momma likes you
What now I guess you think I will too
Even if the pope said he likes you too
I don't really care cause you're a bug a boo

[Hook]
You make me wanna throw my pager out the window
Tell MCI to cut the phone calls
Break my lease so I can move
Cause you a bug a boo, a bug a boo, a bug a boo
I wanna put your number on the call block
Have AOL make my emails stop
Cause you a bug a boo
You bugging what? you bugging who? You bugging me!
And dont you see it ain't cool

[Verse 2]
It's not hot that when in blocking your phone number
You call me from over your best friends house
And its not hot that I can't even go out with my girlfriends
Without you tracking me down
You need to chill out with that mess
Cause you can't keep havin me stressed
Cause everytime my phone rings it seems to be you
And I'm praying that it is someone else

[Pre-Hook]

[Bridge]
When you call me on the phone you're bugging me
When you follow me around you're bugging me
Everything you do be bugging me
You buggin me, You bugging me
When you show up at my door you're bugging me
When you open up your mouth you're bugging me
Everytime i see your face you're bugging me
You're buggin me your buggin me
