(A Capella)
Amazing Gra-a-a-ace
How sweet
The Sound
So-o-ound
That saves
Saved a retch
Like me (me me)
I once
Was
Lo-o-ost
L-o-o-o-ost
But now
(but now)
I'm found
(What you say girl)
But Now
(I'm found)
(They still can't feel you)
But now
I'm found
Was blind but now I see

T'was grace
That taught
My heart
To fear
And that
Gr-a-a-ace
My fears
Relieved
How Precious
Did that grace
Appear
Thee hour I first
Believed
Thank you lordy!
