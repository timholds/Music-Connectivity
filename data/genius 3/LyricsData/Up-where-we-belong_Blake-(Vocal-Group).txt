Who knows what tomorrow brings
In a world, where few hearts survive
All I know, is the way I feel
When it's real, I keep it alive
The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles fly, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the below
Up where the clear winds blow
Some hang on to "used-to-be"
Live their lives looking behind
All we have is here and now
All of our lives, out there to find
The road is long
There are mountains in our way
But we climb a step every day
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles fly, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below
Up where the clear winds blow
Time goes by, (time goes by)
No time to cry, (no time to cry)
Life's you and I, alive, today
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles fly, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below
Up where the clear winds blow
Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagles fly, on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the world below
Up where the clear winds blow
