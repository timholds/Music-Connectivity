[Verse 1:]
I've come home
I've been away too long
But you don't want me back again
And I tried
In the end

I can't say you made me very sad
The point of love is not to lie
Points denied
In the end, in the end
How can you tell me you don't want me

[Chorus:]
When I've done all I can to save the day
Suppose I'm in the way
In the end, in the end, in the end
You don't see sense
Eyes never cry

[Verse 2:]
Please take part of me
Leave the rest to die
I can't say you made me very sad

The point of love is not to lie
Point's denied, in the end, in the end
How can you tell me
You don't want me

[Repeat Chorus x2:]
