[Chorus: Rawsrvnt]
We bow down / In reverence to Your name / We bow down / To hail You as King / We bow down / Giving everything / We bow down / (We bow down to worship) / Yes we bow down

[Verse 1: Rawsrvnt]
We bow down to worship / You alone Lord / 'Cause You alone Lord / Saved our soul / So we bow down to worship / You alone / With our hands raised high / Showing the globe / That You reign in power / Triumphant and might / And tower over the darkness / 'Cause You are the light / The light of the world / For everyone to see / So we bow in submission / 'Cause You are worthy

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Rawsrvnt]
We bow down to worship / You alone King / 'Cause You alone King / Made everything / That's good and perfect / With a decent purpose / Not to be perverted / Or misused / Man You are the truth / The life and the way / The one alone that's worthy / Of all the praise / So hear this praise / From a grateful heart / We're thankful Lord / That we've been bought

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Sean Slaughter]
Bow down to the risen King / Bow down to the Lord of lords / Bow down to the risen King / Bow down to the Lord of lords / Bow down to the risen King / Bow down / Come on lets go / Higher / Higher / Higher / Higher / Higher / Higher / Higher

[Verse 3: Sean Slaughter]
My hearts open wide / My hands to the sky / A smile on my face and a tear in my eye / My focus on You / The Master Creator / Who came even though I didn't ask for a Savior / The graves been defeated / My charges deleted / His strength just increases when mine is depleted / The glory of Jesus is here with us now / We reverence His presence as

[Chorus]

[Vamp]
'Cause You alone deserve it / ('Cause You alone deserve it) / Yeah You alone are perfect / ('Cause You alone are perfect) / O You alone are worth it / ('Cause You alone are worth it) / So we bow down

[Chorus]
