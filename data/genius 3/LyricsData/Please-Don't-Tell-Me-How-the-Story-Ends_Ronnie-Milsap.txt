This could be our last goodnight together
We may never pass this way again
Just let me enjoy 'till it's over or forever
Please don't tell me how the story ends

See the way our shadows come together
Softer than your fingers on my skin
Someday this may be all that we'll remember of each other
Please don't tell me how the story ends

Never's just the echo of forever
Lonesome as the love that might have been
Just let me go on loving and believing 'til it's over
Please don't tell me how the story ends


Please don't tell me how the story ends...
