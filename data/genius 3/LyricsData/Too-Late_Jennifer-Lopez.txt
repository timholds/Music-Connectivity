[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway
Now you say you want to stay
It's too late, cause I'm sending you on your way
You say that you had to go away
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

[Verse 1]
Like a puppet on a string
You came and took control of me
Would have given anything
To be your one and only
Filled my head with fantasies
Of what one day you would give to me
Full of hope for what could be
I sat and waited patiently

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway
Now you say you want to stay
It's too late, cause I'm sending you on your way
You say that you had to go away
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

[Verse 2]
For a time you were for me
Everything that I could need
Gave me time and diamond rings
But something else was missing
You never stayed the whole night through
I suffered, prayed, and cried for you
After all that we've been through
I feel I never even knew you

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway
Now you say you want to stay
It's too late, cause I'm sending you on your way
You say that you had to go away
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

[Bridge]
There's no need to call me on the phone
I don't wanna hear from you no more
No need, don't call
Don't be a fool and stand outside my door
Cause being the woman that I am
I got to go on with other plans

[Chorus]
First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway
Now you say you want to stay
It's too late, cause I'm sending you on your way
You say that you had to go away
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late
