[Hook: Frukwan]
Yo, what's the meaning of life?
Yo, somebody please tell me..
What's the meaning of life?
Yo, somebody gots to help me
Yo, what's the meaning of life?
Yo, somebody please tell me..

[Frukwan]
I look inside the mirror and look in myself, I'm hopin' for help
Everyday I'm hopin' for a brand new strife
The shores of North America, I'm bound to survive
Though I'm not the same, yo I carry a gift
Tricked and sold his cargo on the bowels of ships
But yo, I got my pride, tighten up my stand
Lookin' at the stars, the original man..
Never thought that it would ever come to this
Migrate really wasn't a time when life was great
I wanna go home to the Bering Straights
A place where I know where my kid's is safe
Thoughts of runnin' foul like a rampant disease
Yet, my skin tone really couldn't bring the ease
Gettin' weaker by the day, months and years
Thousands of years we reign, but now I shed a tear

[Chorus: Frukwan]
Yo, what's the meaning of life?
Yo, somebody please tell me..
What's the meaning of life?
Yo, somebody gots to help me
Yo, what's the meaning of life?
Yo, but do you know?

[Frukwan]
Inhale and exhale the breath of mist
Each and every day a new way to exist
Don't wanna use a gun, shoot drugs and dope
Don't wanna wear a cross, 'cuz it brings no hope
In the beginnin' as we know, started back in the land
Well defined, their complexion was just like mines
Come to find we was lead and upon direct
Now we cheat, steal and kill and lost all respect
How much pain would you take before you break the chain?
Most of us don't even care, we was planted with fear
We say the babies are the future, but what's the fuss?
Broken homes, growin' up, they act worse than us
Since we all been double-crossed, sins we wear with pride
Believe the lies, yet, still ain't open our eyes
Lookin' forward to the day that I fast and pray
These is questions that I always say

[Chorus]

[Frukwan]
Goin' through a struggle, yeah it's hard at first
Bein' put down, shunned, ragged, tagged and dragged
The inner strength leave the soul through a body of one
Can't be mad, yo, I'm glad, cuz I know where I'm from
Priceless, I'm like a treasure, I can't be touched
Made an image of myself from the grains of dust
Mold and shape the woman with the curves of a snake
Travel lightyears away and then return to base
Eliminatin' evil's more like a daily chore
Teachin' my ways, that's how I spend most of my days
Balance attack, never been scared to be black
Manifestin' only actual facts
Savin' the kids, spreadin' love, yo, that's how to life
Justice is my reward for the acts that I did
Think about all the things in time, seek and you'll find
Yo, I wanna go home, I got's to know
