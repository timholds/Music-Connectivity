I've seen death
I looked it in the eyes
God has forsaken me
Now it's your time to die
It's time to gather now
To sing in song
Your pleas won't inhibit me
And soon you'll be gone

Burning sensations
Reincarnations
Come on home with me
Sunday morning
Fearful warnings
Never meant that much to me

Death is like birth
And then you'll fly
A new beginning
Let's give it a try
Effervescent children
Let's hold my hand
The sun shines bright
To the promise land

Follow me follow me
Follow me follow me
Follow me follow me
Follow me follow me
Follow me follow me
