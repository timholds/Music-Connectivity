Filthy horizons, grey cold poison
Weakness abyssal, vertigo suicidal
Asphyx, social jails
Then a fix trial you fail
Eclipse is your key
All of that
Cos you're subject to tragedy
And now you're feeding your veins
To forget your painful chains
SinKing crown in abyssal waste
Rusted scepter sealed your fate
Can all the lights turn black?
Does your heart wear the damnation mark?
Suicidal black injection
Screaming hate pain rejection
And now hear the howling knights of destiny
The winds are turning, the skies are angry
Be the plague in their society
Be the one they'll call tragedy
