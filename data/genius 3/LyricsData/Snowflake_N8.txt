You and me, incomplete, can’t this last more than a week?
You think you, are unique. Once you hit the ground you’re
All the same
All the same

Perspiration into condensation
On the backseat window with the love we’re making
Comfort control is so cold…
Till I drop the dial ‘cause I’m in control

Heated seats get your heart to beat
Little slow, little fast till the flow completes
With your back to the floorboards, toes to the sky
Make them curl, make them curl, till I see your soul shine

I’m driving, unhappy, I can still run on empty
I think I, feel complete, wonder if you feel at
All the same
All the same

[Chorus]
I see, beautiful I’m falling
Like the snowflake you’d be
If you could of only
Taken shape and stayed

Before me, endlessly, how could it have been thirty?
I think I, can’t compete, open as I am we’re
All the same
All the same

[Chorus]
