[Hook]
She would do for a pair of shoes or a row of pearl
With these superficial girls
In this artificial world
Hollywood
La la la la la la la
If you knew what it would take to love me down
You would turn back around
And I'd return to this two-faced town
Hollywood
La la la la la la la
Hollywood
La la la la la la la
Hollywood

[Verse]
I take this bottle from the shelf go straight to bottom where all my demons dwell
She said welcome to Hell where you can scream but they won't hear you yell
On the first train to Hollywood
Train to Hollywood
To go find someone else
Baby I can be what you need
Be what you need
Cause I don't feel like myself
La la la la la la
Oh no, I don't feel like myself
La la la la la la

La la la la la la la
