(Q)
I know it's kinda hard
To get over someone
And try to start anew
A new relationship...
No need to rush 'cause you've
Got all the time in the world
Right now let's focus on
How we can keep you happy...

I can feel it when you hurt
You will never be alone
All those crying days are gone
I'll be here to guide you
Baby i will be right there and you know i'll always care baby...

-Chorus-
You can call on me
No matter what the situation
I will be there
Put your trust in me
Whenever you need someone

(Mike)
I know he broke your heart
Your love is truly over
He left you sad and lonely
Now you're feeling empty
You've got to realize
He made a big mistake
Leaving you was the worst
Thing he could ever do....

(Slim)
I can feel it when you hurt
Girl you'll never be alone

Baby i will be right there and you know i'll always care...
