[Verse 1]
I know it's on your heart
That a love like ours shall never fall apart
You are so afraid of the rain
So I will take your hand
And I'll love you in the best way that I can
And I only expect the same

[Chorus]
Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you will never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you will try

[Verse 2]
Though I am sure of what I feel
Never thought a love so true felt so unreal
And I am a little afraid myself
But if you love me day by day
With an honest heart and just a little faith
Baby time will tell the tale

[Chorus] [x2]
