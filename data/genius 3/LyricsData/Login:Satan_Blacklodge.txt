Cursed, Lost Highway
Leading me astray
Path to revelation
Rapture consecration
Suicidal pulsions agressing me?
SataN
Guilty monomania
Social distortion dividing me?
SataN
Incoherent voices tearing my I
Death is talking to my veins?
SataN
I'll give them your seed again
Pure steal weakens the flesh?
SataN
Feed my red desires with pain
Drunk and lost Summoning the dust
We're hiding Far away from God
Abyssal alchemy for the rats
Candles shiver in the grim room
In the shadows we laugh dark
Black twisted f*cked up ritual
Echoing soul's distortions
Incarnating black inner vibrations
To open the gates to annihilation

Poison
Heroin
Black magic stones in my veins
Connected to the Master's network
Walls are running away
Morbid orgasm fake paradise taste
Dissolve my soul in Inferno
The heavens are losing me again
As an end to the invocation
A wandering point on a helpless arm
Dare my morbid eyes to understand
