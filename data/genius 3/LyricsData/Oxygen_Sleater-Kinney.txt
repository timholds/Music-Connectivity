I wanna run away
I wanna get away
But I will never get up
Oh, won't you help me up?
I rely on oxygen
I depend on bitter snow
I rely on oxygen
I depend on bitter cold
I want to know
Why it hurts to stay
Hurts to go away
Will I be okay?
Crawled out of the mud
This filth you called your love
Slept for countless days
But I'll be okay
I wanna run away
I wanna get away
But I will never get up
Oh, won't you help me up?
I rely on oxygen
I depend on bitter snow
I rely on oxygen
I depend on the bitter cold
I didn't know I could feel this low
(Oxygen)
So afraid that I'll watch you go
(Bitter snow)
I didn't know I could feel this low
(Oxygen)
So afraid that I'll watch you go
(Bitter cold)
Take my strength out
But I'm not down
Write this reverse
I'm not down
I wanna run away
I wanna get away
But I will never get up
Oh, won't you help me up?
Take my strength out
But I'm not down
Write this reverse
But I'm not down
