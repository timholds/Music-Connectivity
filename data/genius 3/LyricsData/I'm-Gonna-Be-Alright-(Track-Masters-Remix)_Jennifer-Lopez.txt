[Intro]
Oh yes

[Verse 1]
Uh huh, yeah
I want to be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears
The reason you have the courage to confront your fears
The reason there's two karats in each your ears
I sperge with the paper man, I don't care
How you like the pumps, boots, jeeps, coops
Make celebs fifty fall off never
What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine
So when I shine you shine
Come on and fine the champagne, we can toast to life
Crap table in Vegas, you can toss the dice
Don't let your friends get you confused saying 50 bad news
I need you in my life girl you're too good to loose

It's funny because for a while
I walked around with a smile but
Deep inside I could hear voices telling me this isn't right
Don't you know it's not for you
I always knew what I had to do
But its hard to get away
Because I love you I just tried to stay

[Chorus][x2]
I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'm a be alright

[Verse 2]
Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize I can't change you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Said I wouldn't walk away
Someday's I want to stay
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay
Never thought it would be true
Me living without you
But now it's time for me to make that move

[Verse 3]
Yeah
Uh huh
Yeah
Now when I tell you what my wishes are you don't respect it
When I smile at you, you don't smile back to reconnect it
You haven't even gone long but I already miss you
I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you
All the talking on the phone
All the time we share
How could you fix your mouth to say I don't care
I had plans for us to buy ice together
Engagement rings and things and share life together
Now when your friends tell you 50 called you like whatever
Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start
Or was it my actions that made us fall apart
Just want you to know you'll always have a place in my heart

[Chorus]

Oh no
Be alright yes
Oh no
Says I'm going to be alright

[Chorus]
