[Hook]
Got 40 soldiers, only 4 riders
Got a hundred blunts got like 4 lighters
They don't let us sit with the outsiders
Got like twenty bitches pulling all-nighters
Got like twenty bitches pulling all-nighters
Got like twenty bitches pulling all-nighters
Got like twenty bitches pulling all-nighters
Got like twenty bitches pulling all-nighters

[Chorus]
Y'all gamble with it, you don't know the price
Fuck around with life, you gotta roll the dice
Seen Cash pull up in that ghost tonight
Talking all white, that's that poltergeist
All white, that's that poltergeist
Talking all white, that's that poltergeist
All white, that's that poltergeist
All white, that's that poltergeist

[Verse]
They're getting money so necessary
I'd rather sleep in the cemetery
You know this shit is so legendary
My pops a G it's hereditary
Y'all want this beef but y'all vegetarian
I send your dogs to the veterinarian
I got real Somalians , got real Arabians
They might dump your body in the Mediterranean

[Hook]
Got 40 goons, only 4 riders
Got a hundred blunts got like 4 lighters
They don't let us sit with the outsiders
Got like twenty bitches pulling all-nighters
Got like twenty bitches pulling all-nighters
Got like twenty bitches pulling all-nighters
Got like twenty bitches pulling all-nighters
Got like twenty bitches pulling all-nighters

[Chorus]
Y'all gamble with it, you don't know the price
Fuck around with life, you gotta roll the dice
Seen Cash pull up in that ghost tonight
Talking all white, that's that poltergeist
All white, that's that poltergeist
Talking all white, that's that poltergeist
All white, that's that poltergeist
All white, that's that poltergeist
