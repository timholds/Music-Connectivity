[Chorus]
Baby come with me
I know I can set you free
If you take this trip with me
You will be open off my love
If only for one night
I know I can make you mine
Touch you in that place you like
You'll be open off my love

[Verse 1]
Take a moment to stop and think about
The last time you felt like this
Come on baby, nobody's going to see
Because I know you are feeling me
I can see it in your eyes
There is no use in trying to hide
When I touch you get hot
Then I got you where I want you

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Don't waste another moment
Don't hold back
I am going to give you what you need
I am going to take you where you want to go
On a trip to ecstasy
I can see it in your eyes
There is no use in trying to hide
When I touch you get hot
Then I got you where I want you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I want to be where he wants me to be
When he wants me to be
When he wants me
I'm going to keep him feeling me
I'm going to keep him wanting me
I want to be where he wants me to be
When he wants me to be
When he wants me
I'm going to keep him up all night
I'm going to keep it on his mind

[Chorus] [x4]
