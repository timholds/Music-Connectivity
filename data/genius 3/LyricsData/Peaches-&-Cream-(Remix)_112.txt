[P. Diddy]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I like the way it's goin down (That's that shit right there)
C'mon, c'mon (That's that shit right there)
For all my ladies (That's that shit right there)
Bad Boy baby (That's that shit right there)
I got that peaches and cream (That's that shit right there)
Peaches and cream
It's the P the U the F the F

From the car to the bar, from the bar to the telly
Your neck to your bra, your bra to your belly
And she know, where PD go, left the ego
Catch me below her belt like a foul boxer
She a freak, but she sweet so I can't knock her
I just push her legs back til she propped up
Tongue her and see her hit high notes like the opera
And I don't waste a drop til I taste the spot
Give me chills but I make it hot
Watch; I'mma prove in times, I'mma make ya lose your mind
In a lengua smooth as mine
And I never question what hon' do
When she meet me, she knock on door 1,1,2
From the 404 to 212
You got peaches and cream, ma, where's my scoop? c'mon!

[Slim]
Let me tell you what I wanna do
Let me show you that I'm feelin' you
Wanna sex, wanna ride with you
Wanna taste, wanna put my lips all over you
Can't get enough of you
Always taken of you
So sweet, so very wet
So good, girl you make me sweat
Girl I'm talkin' 'bout

[Chorus]
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (that's right)
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine (girl, you taste so good to me)
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream

[Q]
I never thought that I would be
So addicted to you
On top, underneath, on the side of you
Better yet, baby, inside of you
Love the way you're just flowin down
And I can feel it all around
In the front, in the back of you
Ooh I love the taste of you
Girl you know what I'm talking about

[Chorus]
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream


Won't stop girl you know I can't get enough
Wanna taste it in the morning when I'm waking up
Like peach cobbler in my stomach when I eat it up
Got your legs around my neck so I can't get up
See the boys 112 we from the A'
(A' - shorty we don't play)
And when it comes to eating peaches, shorty we don't play
So all the ladies in the house if your peach the shit
Put your hands in the air represent your clique

[Chorus]
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend (that's right)
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine (girl, you are so tasty)
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine (girl, you taste so good to me)
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream

[Chorus]
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream

Oh girl I need it
I gotta have it
It's always on my mind
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream
I like it in my car
Or even in my bed
Or baby on the stairs (icecream)
Know what I mean
Peaches and cream

[Chorus fade]
Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean

Peaches and cream
I need it cause you know that I'm a fiend
Gettin' freaky in my Bentley limousine
It's even better when it's with ice cream
Know what I mean, peaches and cream
