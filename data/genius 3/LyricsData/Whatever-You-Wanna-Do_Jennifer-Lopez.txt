[Intro]
C'mon man, I need something that I can move to
You needa give me some of that funk!

[Verse 1]
Pulled up at the red light
Cutie popped up on my left side
Window down, waiting for my reply
Not a word, I saw it in his eyes
Tell me something good, baby
He said, "Whatever you want to do..."
He pulled to the curb, cops flash by
I got out with catwalk shy
Short skirt, golden brown thighs
Gucci heels, four inch high
He touched my face
Smiled and said, "Whatever you want to do..."

[Chorus]
Now I, said I usually need some time to get inside
So I don't know why you and me feel so right
Baby, we need tonight

[Verse 2]
We sipping, music all loud
Conversation, your lollypop mouth
You open up, sweet things come out
Whisper to me, what you talking about
I said, "I think you know."
He said, "Whatever you want to do..."
You stand up, taking my breath
It's your song so you do it two steps
I turned away, moved my hips slow
Your thoughts, fully exposed
Now we better stop playing
I said, "Boy, whatcha gonna do?"

[Chorus]
Now I, said I usually need some time to get inside
So I don't know why you and me feel so right
Baby, we need tonight

[Breakdown]
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)

[Chorus]
Now I, said I usually need some time to get inside
So I don't know why you and me feel so right
Baby, we need tonight

[Outro]
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
Whatever you want (hey, hey)
