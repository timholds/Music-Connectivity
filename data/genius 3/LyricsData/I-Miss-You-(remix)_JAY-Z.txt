What's up baby girl! (Ho!)
Thought I had to talk to you again, missing you (Hey, ey, ey, ey)
Tim is missing you Missy's missing you
Rashad is missing you your mom is missing you (N-n-n-n-no no no)
Your pop is missing you Dame is missing you damn we missing you whooh!

All we listen to is all the different yous
Four page letters in addition to
Have you ever loved somebody used to get the party poppin
We used to party hop, we used to be in the Hampton's partied a lot
We was The Breakfast Club you was a part of the roc
We used to make up special names for the food we ate
Remember serial pie one of your favourite plates (I miss you)
Well Dame told me tell you he's doin well
Due to the circumstances, it could've been Bellevue
But I ain't got to tell you, you lookin over us
Our little angel, but you know what

Brooklyn's missing you Detroit is missing you
New Orleans missing you Philly's missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)
Your uncle's missing you your families missing you
Your fans is missing you the galleries missing you
Damn we missing you
(It's been too long and I'm lost without you)

Now Star is mad I won't grant him a interview
Now he's dissing me cause he dissed you
Can you believe the nerve of this dude?
Cause of your memory I won't bring in the pistols
(Wondering if your the same and who's been with you)
But he got issues enough of that lame
I never seen pain like your parents pain
But I know God protecting you
You used to read Seed Of The soul I know God perfecting you (I miss you)
All the estrogens the darker texture you are the more intellectual
You are so professional our little purple
