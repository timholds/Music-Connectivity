Let the guns go off
Let the bombs explode
Let the lights go dark

Life is good
Life is good

Let the guns go off
Let the bombs explode

[Hook]
Oh just once
We'll be gone before we know
Question how will we go
Will we see the ones we've lost?

Oh just once
We'll be gone before we know
Question how will we go
Will we see the ones we've lost?

Oh, just once
You'll see the ones I've lost
But how would I know
To see the ones I've loved?
