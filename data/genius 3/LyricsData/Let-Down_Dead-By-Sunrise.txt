And the tears fall like rain, down my face again
Oh the words you wouldn't say
And the games you played with my unfoolish heart
Oh I should have known this from the start

Oh the winter and spring
Going hand in hand just like my love and pain
How the thought of you cuts deep within the vein
This brand new skin stretched across scarred terrain

Said, I don't wanna be let down
I don't wanna live that life again
Don't wanna be led down the same old road
(I don't wanna be let down)
Said, I don't wanna be let down
I don't wanna live my lies again
Don't wanna be led down the same old road
(I don't wanna be let down)

All those years down the drain
Love was not enough when you want everything
What I gave to you, and now the end would start
Oh, I should've listened to my heart

Cause, I don't wanna be let down
I don't wanna live my life again
Don't wanna be led down the same old road
(I don't wanna be let down)
Said, I don't wanna be let down
I don't wanna live my lies again
Don't wanna be led down the same old road

Oh...

Cause, I don't wanna be let down
I don't wanna live that life again
Don't wanna be led down the same old road
(I don't wanna be let down)
Said, I don't wanna be let down
I don't wanna live my lies again
Don't wanna be led down the same old road
(I don't wanna be let down)

I don't wanna be let down the same old road
(I don't wanna be let down)
