[Verse 1: Jenna McDougall]
Faceless, underwater
We can disappear for a while
No one will notice
Shifting, out of focus
The silence calls on us for a moment

[Pre-Chorus: Jenna McDougall]
Sinking down
Thought I lost myself, but I didn’t
Looking up on us
Shadows dance above
Blurry vision

[Chorus: Jenna McDougall]
We could disappear for a while
(Whi-, -ile)
We could disappear for a while
(Whi-, -ile)
We could disappear for a while

[Verse 2: Jenna McDougall]
Nameless, talking
Big dreams and nobody wants them
Weightless, walking
Why does it feel like home when I’m lonely?

[Pre-Chorus: Jenna McDougall]
I always found
On the solid ground
I was tripping
Away from space and time
I don’t really mind
That I’m slipping

[Chorus: Lynn Gunn]
We could disappear for a while
(Whi-, -ile)
We could disappear for a while
(Whi-, -ile)

[Bridge: Jenna McDougall & Lynn Gunn]
It’s not running away
We were never meant to stay in the first place
We could disappear for a while
(Whi-, -ile)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We could disappear for a while
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We could disappear for a while
Wading’s not enough
It’s more than just dipping your feet in
(Yeah -eah -eah)
Dive in if you want
But I’ll be jumping off in the deep end
Wading’s not enough
It’s more than just dipping your feet in
(Yeah ooh ooh)
Dive in if you want
But I’ll be jumping off in the deep end
(Ooh ooh)

[Chorus: Jenna McDougall]
We could disappear for a while
(Whi-, -ile)
We could disappear for a while
(Whi-, -ile)
We could disappear if we let go of it all
It’s not running away
We were never meant to stay
(We were never meant to stay)
We could disappear for a while
Yeah, yeah
