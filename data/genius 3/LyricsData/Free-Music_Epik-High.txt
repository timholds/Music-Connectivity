Tick tock, tick tock, and this time
When I set it off, can nobody stop it in time
Get off the block son
And get your sunblock when I rhyme
It's eternal sunshine of the spotless mind
From the top, rewind
Wrote rhymes in my dad's attic
Rap addict since Illmatic and I'm still fanatic
Never stop but when I'm stopped
I jog my mind around the writer's block
Till it's out of breath and asthmatic
I've had it with the paperchase, need I mention?
The rap game is all show and lyrical descension
Pretension, obsession for physical possession
I'll pay for your CD, but pay no attention
Ascension, I'll never lie to get it
Fake people piss me off like diuretic
To die or live it, you know the choice is yours
Just make sure that the voice is yours
Pe2ny, yeak he's breakin' it down
MYK, yeah I'm takin' it down
Supreme T, he's never fakin' the sound
Freestylin steady shakin' the ground
DJ Pe2ny, yeak he's breakin' it down
MYK, yeah he's takin' it down
Supreme T, I'm never fakin' the sound
Freestylin steady shakin' the ground
Let me make the beat drop
And that's where I'm coming in
Unlock the truth in the booth and I'm runnun' in
Pe2ny drummin' in listen to the drums, man
Listen to my voice and get your head spun, man
Eyes bloodshot but his tongue is on fire
Like a mind thought-blocked
But this buss will inspire
We live in these rhymes
This life reppin' mics in the right direction
I'm guessin' in takes us higher
Temporary relief so I'm makin' it last
Takin' it fast, lacin' buds in raps tracin' raps with facts
Steppin' up the game but not reppin' for fame
Spittin truth up in the booth, then we settin' it in flames
Pe2ny, yeak he's breakin' it down
MYK, yeah I'm takin' it down
Supreme T, he's never fakin' the sound
Freestylin steady shakin' the ground
DJ Pe2ny, yeak he's breakin' it down
MYK, yeah he's takin' it down
Supreme T, I'm never fakin' the sound
Freestylin steady shakin' the ground
We keep it movin' at a zen way pace
Cause we losin music in this end day race
It's all big business with Ken Lay waste
The same sickness that's eating MJ's face
It's a liable case that won't pollute my brain
Never let them put my truths to shame
Cut the noose that hangs
Lay bare of tattooed lucid pains
Reveal truth, I'm the loosest change
All these soothless sayings, ruthless vain raps
I'm sick of it
So no hope for you thoothless lame cats
I'm killin' at a show
Thoughts ridin' through this train track
Just thinkin' of a flow
So expect a trainwreck, let'em know
Your rhyme schemes of crime themes
Make me wanna red rum your whole catalog
Like it was the Shining
Yeah it's frightening, so do the right thing
We like the thunder in the storm and the lightening
Enlightening
Pe2ny, yeak he's breakin' it down
MYK, yeah I'm takin' it down
Supreme T, he's never fakin' the sound
Freestylin steady shakin' the ground
DJ Pe2ny, yeak he's breakin' it down
MYK, yeah hes takin' it down
Supreme T, I'm never fakin' the sound
Freestylin steady shakin' the ground
We map, map, map the soul
East, west, to the far east back to Seoul
We map, map, map the soul
East, west, to the far east back to Seoul
We map, map, map the soul
East, west, to the far east back to Seoul
We map, map, map the soul
East, west, to the far east back to Seoul
