[Hook]
Ooooh babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 1]
Don't say it's the end of the road
Remember the flowers I sent
I need you, babe
To put through the shredder
In front of my friends

[Hook]
Ooooh babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 2]
How could you go?
When you know how I need you
To beat to a pulp on a Saturday night

[Hook]
Ooooh babe, don't leave me now

[Verse 3]
How can you treat me this way?
Running away
Ooooh babe
Why are you running away?

[Outro]
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, babe
Ooh, ooh
Aaaaaaaaaaargh!!
