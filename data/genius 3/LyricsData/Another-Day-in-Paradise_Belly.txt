[Hook]
Another day in paradise
(Bitch you know me)
Baby even if I crash, it was worth the flight
(Bitch you know me)
Just another day in paradise
(Bitch you know me)
Baby even if I crash it was worth the flight
(Bitch you know me)

[Verse 1]
Up for days, baby I ain't even sleep yet
Talkin' 'bout the wave, you ain't even get your feet wet
I'm in the lead and I ain't even in the league yet
I bet this batch can make Keith Sweat and eat less
Moroccan bitch she making couscous
She got some screws loose, Timb boots to stash the deuce-deuce
Salute, don't make me have to let the troops loose
They telling lies like the new truth, but who's who?
That's why I had to go my own way
Keep on fucking with you me, it might just be your own grave, you dig
Don't ask me why I took the long way
I had to walk on water just to make my own waves
Back when life felt something more like purgatory
I'm so high to see me you gon' need observatories
Don't go askin' 'bout me bitch, I know you heard the stories
Keeps you humble but my dogs would fuckin' murder for me

[Hook]
Another day in paradise
(Bitch you know me)
Baby even if I crash, it was worth the flight
(Bitch you know me)
Just another day in paradise
(Bitch you know me)
Baby even if I crash it was worth the flight
(Bitch you know me)

[Verse 2]
They crucify us  then get mad that we the new messiahs
Salute the giants cause David became the new Goliath
And through defiance the people will build a true alliance
The news is biased, they lie to us and we choose to buy it
See I got killers from DADE county to Beirut
Point out the target then shoot, I call them Babe Ruth
He prayed to God then they killed him over his Jes√∫s
Bananas clips for gorillas, I let the apes loose
Grew up on Biggie now I'm cool with Diddy
We the only ones really running through the city
I keep going like this I just might lose a kimmy
Hoes throw it back just like the miracle in music city

[Hook]
Another day in paradise
(Bitch you know me)
Baby even if I crash, it was worth the flight
(Bitch you know me)
Just another day in paradise
(Bitch you know me)
Baby even if I crash it was worth the flight
(Bitch you know me)
