Gonna tell you all a story
About a girl who's just informed me
That all she needs to love me
Is a quiet peaceful day

She don't need no shiny diamonds
Or a fancy car to drive in
She just needs me there beside her
On a quiet peaceful day

She loves me better than you
And i'm dying to tell all the world
She loves me better than you
And i'm going to tell all the world

Gonna tell you all a story
About a girl who's just informed me
That she's leaving me this morning
It's a quiet peaceful day

She'll be leaving with her new boy
Wearing brand new shiny diamonds
They'll drive off into the sunrise
In a new mercedes-benz

Did i tell you all a story
About a boy who's feeling lonely
Always dreaming up these stories
On a quiet peaceful day
