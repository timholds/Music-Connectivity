By the time you're 25
Bills, another job, another baby
Get a boring job
But yet, you're a lie
Did you speak? Did you want to rhyme?
No, no, no no
Fame is no way to survive

I forget my heart can beat
In ways besides one, two repeat

I can't believe it, what you want for me
I am speechless at the life you chose for me

By the time you're 25
Another record, another tour
You must be rich, baby you're a star
But yet, you're a lie
Could you speak, leave us all behind
Now I'm not sorry that I beat you
At your own stupid game

I forget my mouth can form
Sounds that slide beyond locked doors

I can't believe it, what you want for me
I am speechless at the life you chose for me

I want, I want, I want to get out
Of this repetitious shout
I want, I want, I want to get out
Of this repetitious shout

I want, I want, I want to get out
You're staying, I hope that's what it's about
I want, I want, I want to get out
Of this repetitious shout

I want, I want, I want to get out
You're staying, I hope that's what it's about
I want, I want, I want to get out
Of this repetitious shout
