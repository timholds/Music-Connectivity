[Intro]
I'm in the studio right now, workin'
You always doin' too much
You always doin'...
Man I gotta go

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't give a fuck 'bout these niggas or bitches
These bitches be crazy, stay runnin' their mouth
I poured a pint of the lean in my cup
And I took me a perky and slugged out my mouth
Bitch if you not givin' head, or fuckin' me
Lil' bitch, I'm kickin' you out
I got her eatin' her friend, she fuckin' me
I fuck them both off my clout

[Chorus]
Ooh, I fuck it up, run a check on 'em
Ooh, I know they hate how I flex on 'em
Ooh, I got my 9, finna wet on 'em
Ooh, I'm drivin' fast, I'ma jet on 'em
Ooh, I fuck it up, run a check on 'em
Ooh, I know they hate how I flex on 'em
Ooh, I got my 9, finna wet on 'em
Ooh, I'm drivin' fast, I'ma jet on 'em

[Verse]
Nigga you stupid, don't love a bitch, I'm not Cupid
I got the pack in the back
Young nigga ruthless, I'll leave you toothless, ooh
This is not Cat in the Hat
Anybody get whacked, get smacked, no cat, bitch
I'll leave you gone off the map
Slim 'bout to get tacked, gift wrapped, tip tap, bitch
I ate it up like a snack
Lie 'cause I know you a bitch
You on the web, all of that talkin', sub-tweetin'
I will run into your house
Fuck on your daughter, then give your mama a beatin'
Wait, I mix the M and the grape
Then bust a nut on her face
I catch a bitch at the light
I'm drivin' foreign, wanna race?
I got the bands in the safe

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't give a fuck 'bout these niggas or bitches
These bitches be crazy, stay runnin' their mouth
I poured a pint of the lean in my cup
And I took me a perky and slugged out my mouth
Bitch if you not givin' head, or fuckin' me
Lil' bitch, I'm kickin' you out
I got her eatin' her friend, she fuckin' me
I fuck them both off my clout

[Chorus]
Ooh, I fuck it up, run a check on 'em
Ooh, I know they hate how I flex on 'em
Ooh, I got my 9, finna wet on 'em
Ooh, I'm drivin' fast, I'ma jet on 'em
Ooh, I fuck it up, run a check on 'em
Ooh, I know they hate how I flex on 'em
Ooh, I got my 9, finna wet on 'em
Ooh, I'm drivin' fast, I'ma jet on 'em

[Outro]
You still at the studio?
Yeah, why?
Oh my God, I'm so fucking tired of this shit. That's all you do
You know I stay here, man
I'm so tired of you playing games
I gotta get this money, what you talking about? Fuck
You're always at the studio. You never spend time with me. You don't never have fucking time for me
Bitches always trippin'. Fuck
This is bullshit
Man, Boonk Gang, a lotta gang shit
