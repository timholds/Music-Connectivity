[Hook]
She don’t give a fuck
She don’t ever stress me
We don’t even talk
All we do is sex and leave
No there’s no love
She don’t even like me
But if we have drugs
She can be my wifey
When we have drugs
When we have drugs
When we have drugs
When we have drugs

[Verse 1]
I got lost up in it, got lost up in it, got high for a minute
Said my lust for life and these lights are bright and I love these women
Said we bopping slow and we do the dance like we more than winning
Said she off the beat but she’s fine as fuck so I find the rhythm
No love is greater, in this whole world we made up
This love is made-up, it’s made-up
It’s made-up, it’s made-up, it’s made-up (say, aye)
I don’t know this bitch but I love this shit and we both feel splendid
And she loud as fuck so I grab and touch and she don’t get offended
They goin call the law if we don’t get lost in parking lot
She don’t like me dog, she just like the drugs my nigga, don’t get it twisted

[Bridge]
How many more can you give to me?
How many more can you give to me? I know you’re feelin me
Grinding and biting and kissing me
Who gives a fuck bout your history? nobody mentioned it
I coulda taken them all, I coulda taken them all, look at me dog
Look at me dead in the eyes, tell me you ain’t in love

[Hook]
She don’t give a fuck
She don’t ever stress me
We don’t really talk
All we do is sex and leave
No there’s no love
She don’t even like me
But if we have drugs
She can be my wifey
When we have drugs
When we have drugs
When we have drugs
When we have drugs

[Verse 2]
You my one and only, my one and only, I’m on one homie
I don’t know your name I just love that ass, and I’ll pull that pony
Said I hate the club, but I make the club when I walk into it
Said you hate the drink, but you take the drink when I offer fluid
No love is greater, in this whole world we made up
This love is made-up, it’s made-up, it’s made-up, it’s made-up, it’s made-up
I can say right now that I’ll lay you down, I got lots of rubbers
I don’t give a fuck, you don’t give a fuck, we was made for each other
Your friend ain’t cute but my nigga’s a trooper, he’ll take the L
I’m high as fuck and you high as fuck so we parasailing

[Bridge]
How many more can you give to me? How many more can you give to me? I know you’re feelin me
Grinding and biting and kissing me, who gives a fuck bout your history, nobody mentioned it
I coulda taken them all, I coulda taken them all, look at me dog
Look at me dead in the eyes, tell me you ain’t in love

[Hook]
She don’t give a fuck
She don’t ever stress me
We don’t really talk
All we do is sex and leave
No there’s no love
She don’t even like me
But if we have drugs
She can be my wifey
When we have drugs
When we have drugs
When we have drugs
When we have drugs

[Outro]
Ayyy, Ayyyyy, we have drugs

Said ayyy, We love it, we’re in love
We’re in love, we’re in love, we’re in love
Said ayyy, yes lord

Say love, say love, say love
