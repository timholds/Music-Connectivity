[Verse 1: Ricky Martin]
Be careful with my heart, you could break it
Don't take my love for granted, things could change
Sometimes i go insane. I played the fool and you'll agree
I'll never be the same without you here with me

[Chorus 1: Ricky Martin & Madonna]
Cuidado (please be careful) con mi corazon
Me siento algo desnudo cuidado (please be careful)
Es mi corazon, mi corazon

[Verse 2: Madonna]
Be careful with my heart you could break it
Don't take my love for granted
Things could change
Sometimes I go insane
I played the fool and you'll agree
I'll never be the same without you here with me

[Chorus 1: Ricky Martin & Madonna]
Cuidado (please be careful) con mi corazon
Carino no me lastimes cuidado (please be careful)
Es mi corazon mi corazon

[Verse 3: Ricky Martin & Madonna]
If I could reach out to you
Nothing will stop me
Take your head in my hands
Tell me what would you do
Kiss your eyes, sing you to sleep
Your voice sounds like a lullaby
Here's my heart, this time to keep
Here's my heart to keep

[Chorus 1: Ricky Martin & Madonna]
Cuidado (please be careful) con mi corazon
Carino no me lastimes cuidado (please be careful)
Es mi corazon mi corazon
Cuidado (please be careful) con mi corazon
Carino no me lastimes cuidado (please be careful)
Es mi corazon mi corazon
