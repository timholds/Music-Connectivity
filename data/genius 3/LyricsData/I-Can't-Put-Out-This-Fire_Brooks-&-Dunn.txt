[Verse 1]
Seems like every time I call you
I'm standing in the pouring rain
I had another falling out with love
I'm back out on the streets again
I could us a cup of coffee
But I guess I better pass this time
But you could do an old friend a favor
While I'm still on the line

[Chorus]
I know you said it's over
But this old heart's still burning with desire
So tell me one more time
You don't love me anymore
You gotta help me girl
I can't put out this fire

[Verse 2]
It's good to hear your voice again
I can almost see your smile
It's good to talk about old times
If only for a little while
Guess I'll go on back to my place
There's not much else for me to do
I wish that I could close my eyes
Without dreaming of you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh you gotta help me girl
I can't put out this fire
No, no, you gotta help me girl
I can't put out this fire
