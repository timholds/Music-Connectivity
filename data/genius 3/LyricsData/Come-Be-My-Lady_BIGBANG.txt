Been together for a while now
Gettin' closer everyday
I wake up in the morning and smile
Happy to be your side
Don't you get me wrong now
Before we go on
Got a thing I need to know
Think it through, just be sure

The life we live (livin')
The way we lie (lyin')
It's all about the G's (Baby)
The way we think (Thinkin')
The choice you make (Makin')
It's all about the G's (Baby)

[Come be my lady] I can show you what you've always dreamed
[Don't be so shady] you can live a life of luxury
[Maybe I'm crazy] I'm just tryna think of you and me
[This world is so cold] so so cold
[But that's how it goes]

I don't wanna doubt you
Your love is really true
But you see money talks
Can easily flip your thoughts
Wanna know if you love me more
Than the Gucci's and Dior
Losin' you I can't afford
You're the one I adore

The life we live (livin')
The way we lie (lyin')
It's all about the G's (Baby)
The way we think (Thinkin')
The choice you make (Makin')
It's all about the G's (Baby)

[Come be my lady] I can show you what you've always dreamed
[Don't be so shady] you can live a life of luxury
[Maybe I'm crazy] I'm just tryna think of you and me
[This world is so cold] so so cold
[But that's how it goes]

[Come be my lady] I can show you what you've always dreamed
[Don't be so shady] you can live a life of luxury
[Maybe I'm crazy] I'm only thinking about you and me
[This world is so cold] so cold
[But that's how it goes]

Too many play it dirty
The rocks will make'em crazy
I need your honesty
(It's all about the G's)
(Oh) Too many play it dirty
The rocks will make'em crazy
I need your honesty
(It's all about the G's)

[Come be my lady] let me show you - I can love you
[Don't be so shady] from the depths of my heart
[Maybe I'm crazy] I won't ignore you - I'll adore you
[This world is so cold] this world--is so cold
[But that's how it goes]

[Come be my lady] I can show you what you've always dreamed
[Don't be so shady]you can live a life of luxury baby
[Maybe I'm crazy] I'm just tryna think of you and me
[This world is so cold] so so cold
[But that's how it goes]
