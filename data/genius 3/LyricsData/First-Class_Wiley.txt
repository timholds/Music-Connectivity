[Hook: Wiley]
I’m used to economy, but first class is
Top service and champagne glasses
Top service and champagne glasses
I’m used to economy, but first class is
Top service and champagne glasses
Top service and champagne glasses

[Verse 1: Lethal Bizzle]
Man I’m used to economy
F'ed up like the economy
Please don’t bother me
Man’s got no leg room and swag food and
Leave it, chick trying to holla me
Man like "wait, this shit’s criminology"
Ask for a drink, nobody acknowledge me
Man go toilet, 20 man ahead of me
This is a myth I deserve an apology
Leave it
Nowadays man can’t be asked
Any time when I travel
Man I travel first class
22 champagne fill up the glass
Pop went Africa
But what the rush
Yeah
Overwhelmed in service
I put my "stay dench" headphones on
White people look at me like I don’t deserve this
Hood class and the first class and the upper class
And the middle class, feet are nervous
When you see me turn left on the plane door
Better know that I’m turning for a purpose
Economy got me feeling worthless
Even though that I know I get it in
But what’s the point of making money
If you never gonna spend

[Verse 2: Wiley]
I'm used to economy, but first class is
Top service and champagne glasses
A lot of space to move, WiFi
Surfing on air, mind style
I came back in the game with a bang
Upgrade me and my dogs ’cause I can
Kind of service kings and queens get
The kind of service they ain’t seen yet
Oh, don’t play with Lethal & Kan
First class and economy ain’t the same
No, so different, batting long distance
Emirates flights to drive me insane
Got WiFi, I-C-E
Ain’t nobody stopping these icy freaks
And I can’t wait to show my front teeth
I wanna share 'em when I see dreams
I'm cool still on a hot flannel
I’m not trying to be a judge on the panel
But this one’s winning it
Yo I got so much sleep
5 hours a night I weren’t living it
After that flight I learned this
I just got the best service
Even though it might seem pricey
Me going first class again is likely
It’s why I'm in the seventy chilling
I’m staring at the finest women
No griming this way I’m gonna make a killing
More flying more trying, gonna an ending
Keep thrilling, these fans gonna know my name
Still living
Artists know me, I’m cool
Still giving
I tell my whole team please don’t run
‘Cause we ain’t in a hurry
Plus we’re still winning

[Hook: Wiley]

[Verse 3: Kano]
Inbetweeners, dun know Will
Call this Bow in the clunge-mobile
Smithy to my left, chopper to my right
Both out of sync like a kung fu film
Blanket on, yeah, I give her the cock pit
She says no, then I give her the drop lip
I'm a frequent diner, nigga
Like OK boss, give her the chopsticks
Look at the bar, don’t give me a hot trick
We just want some alcohol
See my nigga Steve and Ground
I want my movie Al Capone
Can’t take a nigga out the hood
Can’t take the hood out a nigga
‘Cause as soon as I would, nigga, [?]
We gonna get the keys to the Bimmer
Hair straight, body pear-shaped
Money straight so her fare's paid
Heavy black like she likes her man
Like a scene out of Airplane
W-I-F-E-Y
Make your one in indigo
Now I gotta send them letters first class
And I don’t need no envelope
