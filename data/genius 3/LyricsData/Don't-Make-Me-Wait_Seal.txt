Are we tired of feeling blue?
Can I get along with you?
Just don't tell me it's right
Every time we fuss and fight
And what I really try to say
Is I won't be afraid, yeah
If you say you're willing too
Close your eyes and maybe - maybe see it through, but

Don't make me wait long
Sounds like a sad song of mine
Every time we meet baby, on the street there we go
Always seem to fight, why we do, I never now - that
All I can take
'Cause you ain't easy
Some can relate
That's life, we get back together every time

It amazes me to say, yeah
I've been so tired to find my way close to you
To love divine is what I - what I'm gonna do
Yah, what I'm really trying to say
Is love won't deny me, 'cause everyday is like a new day again
Yeah, my friend
Lovin' till the end yah yah yah yah

Don't make me wait long
Sounds like a sad song of mine
Every time we meet baby, on the street there we go
Always seem to fight, why we do, I never now - that
All I can take
'Cause you ain't easy
Some can relate
So I dream of
And dream of
And dream of
And dream of your life
And dream of
And that's how we make love
And we dream of
And dream of
And dream of
And dream through the night

Don't make me wait long
Sounds like a sad song of mine
Every time we meet baby, on the street there we go
Always seem to fight, why we do, I never now - that
All I can take
'Cause you ain't easy
Some can relate, hey
That's life, we'll get back together every time
