[Verse 1: DeLorean]
Ain't every flower in the concrete bloomin'
Never walked through Bloomin's, it was gloomin'
Droppin' numbers for a feature
Western Union was my partner
I was tryna' get them bourbons on some choppers
Ridin' dirty through the city like I got you
Everything I had about ya blazing fire
I'mma quit when I cop me a couple prizes
It got hot up in that drive
I got tired of sweating bullets, like one day I gotta pull it
Yea - back against the wall, my ego turned into bully
I ain't moving, I ain't budging - I got buzzin' with no budget
Bloggers said I had it next, I was standing next to nothing
Conversations getting deeper, growing further from my people
Lost my love of life in high school I always knew she was a keeper
I was lost since, double crossed, bitch,  now I'm cross fit
Had to work a jelly for a outfit
Outskirts know me by my middle name, ain't no one to blame
Twenty thou', bust it down with the game, everything, mane

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Breaking bread, payin' dues, that's what got me through
Stacking hundreds 'til they blue, that's what got me through
Doing what a king do, that's what got me through
Pulling stunts with the crew, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
That's what got me through bitch, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
Play to win, making moves,  that's what got me through

[Verse 2: Big K.R.I.T.]
Pushing that Maxima with no cash in her
Fresh T so I ain't fastenin' up my belt
Back then I was jamming myself
Like who the fuck gon' tell me
I ain't gonna be the best that they ever heard?
Sipping 211's on the curb
Rollin' dime sacks for that herb and blow it down
What you know about that Greyhound on I-20, off the porch
Out the pen selling CD's outside of Magic City
That's dedication, preparation
My presentation too player made
Clockin' in like Flavor Flav
I'm selling lemon stand lemonade
My Forces bubble toed
Boosie fade turn 'em all even
Grandma think I'm smoking with the junkies cause I'm 160 somethin'
Barely eatin', but that prime time flow
When you been up like two days
Trap house, making beats for the low
50 dollars here, 100 dollars there
But when you're dead broke, everything gone
Thanking God for that place to stay in them showers
Even if they're cold
Them nice young women would cook me a plate for free, even if they hoes
So I don't take for granted steak and shrimp
Leave a healthy tip on the side
For all the times God showed me love
Even if I couldn't pay my tithes

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Breaking bread, payin' dues, that's what got me through
Stacking hundreds 'til they blue, that's what got me through
Doing what a king do, that's what got me through
Pulling stunts with the crew, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
That's what got me through, bitch that's what got me through
That's what got me through, that's what got me through
Play to win, making moves, that's what got me through

[Verse 3: Big Sant]
Late night talking like early night
More like, everyday we was on a mission
To get off in a mansion, not off in a prison
Everywhere representing that 'sippi like we 'posed to, pimp
Take everything I love, put it on my shoulders, pimp throwed it
Everything stood in our way while we tryna build
Got crushed and folded
Now suddenly all the opponents writing rhymes and bending corners
Gimme 50 feet, you all up on me
Cause I don't believe you when you say you want it
And it's bigger than just tryin' to get it when you want to get it right
Went platinum, how to feed your kids like fighting for your life
When the choices wasn't even spoke, the rent or the lights
We all in the dark beggin' for sparks
And can't see the way whether day or the night
And some of them troubles just ain't worth the fight
But this is for pride, this is for niches
I need a witness we havin' church in the night
I guess that I'm doing alright
And thank God for good friends and cousins
Cause I could've been out here struggling
Talkin' about my should've, would've, could've havin' nothin'
When my nothing turns to something
Best believe you've gone to see
No matter how good I make it look, it ain't easy being me, OG

[Outro]
That's what got me through (got me through)
That's what got me through (Better believe it y'all)
