The mistletoe the cat
Only Christmas I reindeer
Never toys and zebra spaghetti
Deck the halls with your mouse shoeshine
Must me Santa clays in the carousel time
Cheer the snow Jupiter on cats
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Dashing through the snow
In a one-horse open sleigh
O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring
Making spirits bright
What fun it is to laugh and sing
A sleighing song tonight!
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Now the ground is white
Go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight
And sing this sleighing song;
Just get a bobtailed bay
Two forty as his speed
Hitch him to an open sleigh
And crack! you'll take the lead
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle Jingle Jingle all the way;
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse...
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells
Oh! what fun it is to ride
In a one-horse open sleigh
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Jingle bells! Happy new years
