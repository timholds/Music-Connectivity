Today you suggested
We take a cable car
If we wanted
Not to go too far
Back and forth
Across the line we go
Not too fast
And not too slow
So much to do so little time is running out
And as the walls draw closer
To our backs
And as we come to our destination let's
Put our mugs back on our coasters and
Unravel all our feelings in the sand
Put our mugs back on our coasters and
Unravel all our feelings in the sand
Baby you know i'm not a fan of dates
An impending bitterness
But i'll eat them anyway
But i'll eat them anyway
So much to do so little time is running out
And as the tide draws closer
To our backs
As we are at our destination we
Should put our tongues back in our ties & stand stand [stand]
Zip across
Up and over. [x6]
Zip across
Up and over [x3]
Let our journey take its course
Zip across
Up and over [x3]
Let our journey take its course
Today you suggested
We take a cable car
I don't want
Not to go too far
Back and forth
Across the line we go
Not too fast
And not too slow
And i don't want to know
And i don't want to know
And i don't want to know
And i don't want to know
And you're someone i don't want to know...
