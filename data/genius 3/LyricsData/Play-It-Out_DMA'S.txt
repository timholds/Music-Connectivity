[Verse 1]
There I was back on side
With the world that keeps on turning
And the world keeps on turning
There I am back on side
With the world that keeps on turning
And the world keeps on turning

[Chorus]
You've got to play it out
You've got to play it out
I'm stuck inside of you
You're stuck inside of me
You've got to play it out
You've got to play it out
I'm stuck inside of you
You're stuck inside of me

[Verse 2]
Sailing back on me
I never shut you out
You never shot me down
Sailing back on me
I never shut you out
You never shot me down

[Chorus]
And when the sun come out
And the sun come down
I'm stuck inside of you
You're stuck inside of me

[Verse 3]
Sailing back on me
I never shut you out
You never shot me down
I never shut you out
You never shot me down
I'm stuck inside of you
You're stuck inside of me
