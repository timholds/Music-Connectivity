[Intro]
Give me a smile, give me your name girl
Give me a sign to get my way
And get what I came for, you
'Cause you don't come easy

[Verse 1]
Give me your hand, come walk with me girl
Nothing's that far when you're near
So come even closer to me
Something so easy to do

[Chorus]
And I fall into the ocean
Inside of your arms, taking me deeper where all the pain goes

[Verse 2]
Give me a smile, give me your name girl
Let them know that you're mine
And I'll do the same for you
'Cause our love comes easy

[Chorus]
And I fall into the ocean
Inside of your arms, taking me deeper where all the pain goes

[Instrumental + Bridge]
And I fall into the ocean (into the ocean)
Inside of your arms, taking me deeper where all the pain goes
With a smile into the ocean
Inside of your arms, taking me deeper giving me new life

[Outro]
You are my whole life
You are my whole life
