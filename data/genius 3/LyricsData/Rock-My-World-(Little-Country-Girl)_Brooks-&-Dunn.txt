[Verse 1]
She's got a T-Top Camaro with a scoop on the hood
And two big speakers blasting Johnny B. Goode
Looking so sweet it ought to be a crime
She plays with my heart and messes with my mind
Acts like Madonna but she listens to Merle
Rock my world little Country girl
She wears snakeskin boots made by Calvin Klein
And cheap sunglasses from the five and dime
All the other girls in school they give her dirty looks
She got an "A" in math and never cracked a book
Sure looks good in her denim and pearls
Rock my world little Country girl

[Chorus]
Rock my world
Drag me out on the floor
Dance with me till I can't dance anymore
One-step, two-step, get in a line
I gotta find a way to make you mine

[Verse 2]
I tell her that I love her but it ain't enough
She says I got to learn to loosen up
Get a little wild on Saturday night
But make sure she's home before the morning light
Sunday she's all ribbons and curls
Rock my world little Country girl

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Rock my world little Country girl
