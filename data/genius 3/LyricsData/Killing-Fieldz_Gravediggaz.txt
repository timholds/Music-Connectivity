[Intro: Poetic]
No more dead-end streets
Gravediggaz, dark angels
Appearing out the fog
Reappearing every millennium
Frukwan, the Gate Keep, Sun Star
Hit it up, yo

[Chorus: Frukwan]
How many's willing, ready for the war
Permit the killing, what if it's ya own
That's the villain, what do you do? Do you kill 'em?

[Verse 1: Frukwan]
Created from a cumulus, [?] shots are numerous
Dangerous combating, when I kill, it's no accident
Punch hole through your abdomen, pluck your vein instrument
Prevent, my thought waves travel infinite
Periodically I generate, natural intake
7 and a half ounce brain, 5% body weight
Repetitious, the bishop, he only enter the vicious
Sleeping with yo misses, tapping that ass vicious
Squeeze time, a pressure mutherfuckers couldn't measure
The dead body severed, fingers are dismembered
Hair follicles point of Rap wrapped in iodine
Wrapped in a adhesive, body found upon the ground of Egypt
Jamaica, the only maker Earth shaker
Natural disaster, hemispheric master
Master crater size hole, niggas that wanna fold
Blow, transport threaten ya fucking life support
Petroleum niggas up on the [?]
Figure, how many niggas rode with Gravediggaz, nigga?

[Break: Poetic]
Yo, next up
Grym Reap, Poetic, Tony Titanium

[Verse 2: Poetic]
Criminal record, never had one, never made none
Never grab guns and blaze them just for fun
I'm military trained, not considered very vain
Out to kill up every frame within the skill of my brain
When I peep certain cats on the block, I know they plot
How to get what I got cause we travel a lot
Doing Hip Hop in spots that get hot
They figure we get knots, a few bad apples'll lick shots
And shit stops, the Most High deprive human life
Out of his gift shop, 34 years up on the brick top
Trying to survive, it's as wild as elephant's stampede
To see, fans leave as someone in the audience, clans bleed
They can't breath, after the next man squeeze
And this girl is like, "Please"
Someone, get a paramedic, the ghetto drama's pathetic
More black armor shredded
I need peace, peace of mind, peace and quiet
Piece of the pie, piece of the action to acquire
A nice piece of real estate when I need escape
A pen and a piece of paper to plot my next caper
Up in the safe haven, smoking peace pipes
As peeps try to peace treaty and we be
Using the Sun as a time piece, dime pieces in two piece bikinis
That give me a piece of ass whenever they see me
What the dealy behind the whole plot?
As I carry a piece to protect my flock
Can't throw rocks while enemies toke Glocks
The human animal brain lock and we go into shock

[Chorus 3X]
