Should let me have a word with you
I wanna take this time to show you what it do
I plan on shaking these other girls you see
Cause I feel that you're the one for me
I really enjoy the way we spend our times
Playing records, kissing and sipping white wine
So I'd like to offer you a thing that you'd like
So take my hand and glide to the sky

[Hook]
I know you wanna (?) deep together
And I really wanna make this last forever
I know you wanna (?) deep together
And I really wanna make this last forever

So I wish to stop you here and say
And I promise you I won't play no games
Cause you know you're dealing with a mild mannered cat like G
And you know my style is what you need
So let me keep on shining this light your way
You count on me providing you with brighter days
And we could make a humble reservation to stay
(?) deep inside your heart
Okay

[Hook]
I know you wanna (?) deep together
And I really wanna make this last forever
I know you wanna (?) deep together
And I really wanna make this last forever

Forever
Together
Forever

[Hook]
I know you wanna (?) deep together
And I really wanna make this last forever
I know you wanna (?) deep together
And I really wanna make this last forever
[Hook]
I know you wanna (?) deep together
And I really wanna make this last forever
I know you wanna (?) deep together
And I really wanna make this last forever
I know you wanna (?) deep together
And I really wanna make this last forever
