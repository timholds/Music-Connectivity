[Hook x2]
They tried to starve me
To stop my heartbeat
I thought they had my back
I thought they used to watch me, nah
What they did, they made my heart freeze
Now I'm so cold, look what they did
They made my heart freeze

There's a fire inside me
I'm ice cold on the surface
See this way they don't know
How hot that fire is burning
Revenge is best served cold
My heart froze to preserve it
I stand in ten feet of snow
Patiently waiting to serve it
Do we deserve it?
Man my life was so cruddy
No money, but we was a fam
When you was a nobody
Put you on your first track
Who knew that you'd go runnin?
And they ask me why the fuck
I am so cold blooded
Hustle and flow money
A couple of snow bunnies
I got rich
And got the whole squad froze honey
I heard your money
Coming slower than froze honey
Copping canary diamonds
I'm shining like froze honey
We started on the corners
Toes cold, nose running
I made a killin and still
I'm spending my old money
If you don't want it
Then don't start it
They go hard, I go hardest
You're the reason I am cold hearted

What they did, they made my heart freeze
Now I'm so cold, look what they did
They made my heart freeze

They made my heart freeze
But what I spit is what you call heat
My life is rhyming on my heartbeat
This why the flow is so cold
You don't know? You're the reason that my soul froze
Below, O, Woah
I get snow in inferno
That means it's so cold I could burn you
The storm is still brewing internal
This why they get the shivers from
Every page they turn in my journal
They left me stranded
With way less than half a chance
I had to turn a snowflake to a avalanche
For real I'm seeing the picture much clearer
Dress warm when you near em
Ears freeze when you hear em
I'm used to it
When they tried to cold grill em
I'm like you must be frostbit if you don't feel em
They're like your attitude is so cold
I'm like it's because of you my heart froze

Fuck it
Ya'll made me like this
The old me was a lot nicer
Haha
Ya'll made my heart freeze
I swear to God ya'll made my heart freeze
Ya'll made my heart freeze
I swear to God ya'll made my heart freeze
