[Chorus]
We've done this so long, so long
How come we keep doing it wrong?
We've done this so long, so long
How come we keep doing it wrong?

[Verse One: Betty Wright]
It's not your first time, Lord knows it ain't mine
And we ain't kids, we don't have to hide what we did
It's all the more reason, we oughta be seasoned
How can we show them the way if this is how we stay?

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Betty Wright]
Why can't you comprehend?
We keep going back where we've been
It didn't work then, so why do it over again?
Wanna make this plain, brother you must love pain
Well I've had enough of that ride, time to step aside

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Betty Wright]
Folks will be watching
Cause they don't wanna miss a thing
Hard to keep myself from falling
It's getting too hard to keep trying
Under the scope, magnifying
Under their scrutiny (scrutiny) all this mutiny (mutiny)
About you and me, they should let us be

[Chorus]
