(VERSE IONE)
I'm alone, I'm getting my skank on
Training
Cus I wanna be the skanking champion
So every time you hear the skanking anthem
Just, make sure you have a skanking tantrum
I've got skanks that I'm scared to do in public
But that's what I'm here to do, skank
Moonslide, and I'm crippin with the right and the left
Couple of skanks, rare and new
If I go to practice here
And you try burst in the room
With a clearer view
You'll see me on a roll
The way I boogie I show
Everybody wants to learn my moves
I do a front flip, back flip
Only in my dream though
I've got a technicoloured dream coat on
Go crazy when the routine goes wrong
Like why's the routine so long?
Here we go now

(CHORUS)
One, two, three, four, I'm skanking x4

(VERSE TWO)
A lightweight gyaldem are super dancers
Back it up girl, you're a super parker
Plus the angles that you choose are smarter
I wanna blah blah, but we'll sort it after
Cus right now all I wanna do is keep boppin
You see me doing it, high street boppin
You see me doing it, late night shopping
You'll see me doing it, party ain't stopping
Tunes I keep dropping
Skanks are outrages
I'm trying to avoid the cheese. Quavers
Out to all the ravers, on the side line
When you see me in the middle, that's my time
I bust a one job, just like a yard man
I swing around this jungle like Tarzan
When the haters say, "We can't stand him."
I'm in my bedroom, skanking

(CHORUS) x4

(BRIDGE)
Skank to the left
Boogie down, skank to the right
Boogie, skank to the left
Boogie down, skank to the right
Grab a right foot, jump it
Boogie, grab a left foot, jump it
Grab a right foot, jump it
Boogie, grab a left foot, jump it

(CHORUS) x8
Hold tight all the skankers, when you're on your own
In your bedroom, or in your house
Wherever you are
Having a little skank, practicing
Whilst no one is watching
Hold tight the people that burst in whilst we're skanking
It's nothing. We're just skanking

(CHORUS) x3
