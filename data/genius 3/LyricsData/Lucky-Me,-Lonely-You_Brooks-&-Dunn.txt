[Intro]
Girl you've got lone the
Girl you've got lonely written all, ha ha

[Chorus]
Girl you've got lonely written all over you
I can read the writing from across this crowded room
All by yourself there in your world of blue
Lucky me, lonely you

[Verse 1]
Must be in the cards
Fate played a part
Brought us here tonight
Heaven must have lined the stars
Up in the sky just right

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Who knows the right song
A slow dance might heal your heartache?
Something tells me I don't know
I just might be here to save the day

[Chorus][x2]
