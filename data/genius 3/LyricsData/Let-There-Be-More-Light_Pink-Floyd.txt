[Intro]

[Verse 1: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Far, far, far, far away – way
People heard him say – say
I will find a way – way
There will come a day – day
Something will be done

[Chorus 1: David Gilmour]
Then at last the mighty ship
Descending on a point of flame
Made contact with the human race
At Mildenhall

[Verse 2: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Now, now, now is the time – time
Time to be – be – be aware

[Chorus 2: David Gilmour]
Carter’s father saw him there and
Knew the road revealed to him
The living soul of Hereward the Wake

[Verse 3: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Oh, my, something in my eye – eye
Something in the sky – sky
Waiting there for me

[Chorus 3: David Gilmour]
The outer lock rolled slowly back
The service men were heard to sigh
For there revealed in glowing robes
Was Lucy in the sky

[Verse 4: Richard Wright & Roger Waters]
Oh – oh – did you ever know – know
Never ever will they
I cannot say

[Chorus 4: David Gilmour]
Summoning his cosmic powers
And glowing slightly from his clothes
His psychic emanations flowed
