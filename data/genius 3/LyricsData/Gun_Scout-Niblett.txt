[Verse 1]
I think I'm gonna buy me a gun
A nice little silver one
And in a crowd someday
You won't see it comin' anyway
Maybe you'll be holding her hand
Or watching her shitty band

[Verse 2]
Really what did you expect?
Spend months lying in her bed
Your lies came so easily
I can't believe you think they'd work on me
I watched you both hide out
You didn't want the world to find outâ€”ha!

[Chorus]
You took your love away from me
And I am thankful, everyday
She took your love away from me, from me
And I am thankful, everyday

You took your love away from me
I am thankful, everyday
He took your love away from me, from me
And I am thankful, everyday

[Outro]
But I think I'm gonna buy me a gun
A nice little silver one
In a crowd someday
You won't see it comin' anyway
