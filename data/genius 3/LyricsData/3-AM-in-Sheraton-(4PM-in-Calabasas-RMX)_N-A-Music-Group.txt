(Verse 1: Alistotle)
I’m in it for the long run
All you people you’re supposed to know
Why in the world would I force myself to present these bars to you?
My life’s on the line now
You still ask who am I now
Like you listen but you’re missing what I’m saying
Cause you looking for a dance now, yeah
Say I’ma die a legend
Lay flowers on my grave just as I imagined
Taste sour when I say I’ll make it in a minute
I choke on my pride as I swallow it, nigga
I chose this life and I’ll follow it, nigga
I shoot on sight, take coverage, nigga
You be tellin’ me you gon’ fight my demons
All I gotta say is I’ma drown in d’evils
Back to the lecture at hand
Perfection is perfected and the question is the answer
The Message is the anthem, I’m already mid-air
Have I jumped? Or have I fell?
I’m here with NA Bill, I’m never going to fail
In spite of these bars, I’m never going to jail
My last meal on death row would be a happy meal
Cause my life is sad and I still may end up in hell

(Bridge: NA Bill + Alistotle)
Big dreams, flashing lights
3 AM in Sheraton like
We at work all night back to back
So you know we gotta put what sounds right
Getting that Cobain effect
Going crazy, I just might
Lose my head in a fight and it’s bad
That’s my human condition but it’s not humane like

(Verse 2: NA Bill)
Rinse off the bad thoughts
Hence the fights that we go through
Walking in the footsteps of others wearing different shoes
Knowing only mine fit me
Lookin’ at other people’s families
Wishin’ mine were that tight
I done lost a lot of friends in them lost nights
People mourning on the sidewalks while I’m here
Contemplating on my depressions
We're losing the value of life while others lost lives to value
When will I wake up? When will I get on my feet?
When will I see the light?
Questions roaming like sheep inside the cerebellum
Dreaming of a couple billion like a Rockefeller
While rocking a Roc-A-Fella rock, all day!
I still remember the black bag with the golden accents
You wear your heart on your sleeve
Kinda like me that what got me attracted to you
But my pops was in the hospital that weekend
I was supposed to take you out in
Now conversations turned awkward like I misguided you
But I speak the truth that was the oath
Old life with past striped
Tryna get it so I still strive like
3 AM in the studio that’s my kind of night
Fuck sleep, my ambitions speak!
Y’all work for retirement, I work for greatness
Hence the understatement
I’m the underdog
I’m the undercover prodigy like them Adidas, no stripes
You playing generals, I’m a living miracle
Now when you invite me
Betta know my punchlines come +1
Sniffing lines with a Quran page, waitin’ on them blessings
Just make sure when you see God you ready to address him
Conversations with my homie bout
How when we open up a studio we won’t put a wack song out
Guess my standards have lowered ever since
