B-lue R-idge Mountains turning green
I wanna go home again to see my mountain friends
Spring-time opens up my heart
Makes me want to share that good ole mountain air

Life's so young and free for all
For those who answer the Blue Ridge Mountains call
B-lue R-idge Mountains turning green
I wanna go home again to see my mountain friends

Sun-rise drinks the morning dew
Walking on new plowed ground distant cowbells sound
T-all t-rees reach the misty blue
And all their leaves of green are shadows on a mountain stream

Dog-wood and mountain laurel bloom
A welcome mat for nature's living room
B-lue R-idge Mountains turning green
I wanna go home again to see my mountain friends

N-ight t-ime gathers in the crowd
Listen to the children sing hear the banjos ring
B-lue R-idge Mountains music sound
Comes from lonely hill the song of a whippoorwill

Old time fiddles that I hear
Play the tunes that I love so dear
B-lue R-idge Mountains calling me
I wanna go home again to see my mountain friends
