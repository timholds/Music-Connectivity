I
Have never been so much
In love
Before
What a difference
A true love made in my life
So nice
So right
Loving you gave me something new
That I've never felt
Never dreamed of
Something's changed
No it's not the feeling I had before
Oh it's much much more
Love
I never knew that a touch
Could mean
So much
What a difference
And when we walk hand in hand
I feel
So real
Lovers come
And then lovers go
That's what folks say
Don't they know
They're not there when you love me, hold me and take care
And what we have is much more than they can see

What we have is much more than they can see
[Repeat until end]
