So you want to start a new life
That's ok
Go regain your independence
And fly
A result so ugly
A process so beautiful
Go and throw it all away
And i'll be fine just as long as you

Don't say it unless you mean it
Don't say it don't say you love me

Human love has got a shelf life
It gets stale
A born on date an expiration
In time

Synchronize watches
Set the alarm
As you leave i'll hold the door with a smile
Just as long as you

Somebody told me that love falls like rain
Sooner or later it comes back down again
In vicious way
