[Verse 1]
Time goes slowly now in my life
Fear no more of what I'm not sure
Searching to feel your soul
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive

[Verse 2]
Love in and out of my, my heart
And though life
Can be strange
I can't be afraid
Searching to feel your soul
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

[Chorus]
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive
I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive
