Call an ambulance, Min's got cancer
But my heart is busted now I'll die faster
Her music's been done, her songs have been sung
Call an ambulance my life's a disaster

All my heros were shot just as thoughts got sold, my complaints ring loud in my ears alone
I was born the day after soul and forty years late for the sound of my amplifier
But my hands can't hear and my hearts right here and I've got freedom and I've got years
I hear ya, I hear ya, your saxophone is my guitar

Call an ambulance, Min's got cancer
I should call it all quits and lie down beside her
My musics been done, my songs are all sung
I'm a second too late, I should have been faster
