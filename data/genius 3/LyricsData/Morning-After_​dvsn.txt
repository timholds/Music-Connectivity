[Verse 1]
Start of the morning
Everyone's calling you to get some time
It can wait till the morning
The world is safer when we're both inside

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what it's gonna take for you to stay
You ain't gotta do a thing
No you can just lay here with me tonight
You can just lay here, roll up and stay here

I know you think it must be the alcohol
And yeah I've been drinking, no it ain't that at all
Is it you? Is it me? Is it both of us?
And now that we're comfortable

[Chorus]
I really gotta know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay
I really wanna know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning

[Verse 2]
After we wake in the morning
My mind is still on the little things we did
I know where we was talking, to where we end up
It's not the way to live

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me what it's gonna take for you to stay
You ain't gotta do a thing
No you can just lay here with me tonight
You can just lay here, roll up and stay here

I know you think it must be the alcohol
And yeah I've been drinking, no it ain't that at all
Is it you? Is it me? Is it both of us?
And now that we're comfortable

[Chorus]
I really gotta know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay
I really wanna know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning

[Chorus]
I really gotta know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay
I really wanna know, if you don't wanna come
You're the one I want, one I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning

[Outro]
I really wanna know
I really gotta know
(One I want to stay)
I really wanna know
I really gotta know
I really gotta know
I really gotta know
One I want to stay the morning
One I want to stay the morning (yeah)
(One I want to stay)
(Stay the morning)
(Oh no)
