[Intro: Ash]
Remix yeah

[Chorus: Ash]
Baby like the way that she peel this
I put her ass on the hitlist
And baby can you feel this, yeah yeah yeah
I wanna get up in your business
And there is somethin' 'bout this girl, she wanna take my heart
And we can get on first class when we fly yard
Baby know I got this and we don't talk
There's somethin' 'bout this bum that goes boombayah

[Bridge: Ash]
She say I got her feelin' high like the Everest
Keep on talkin' like you crazy yeah
Now she callin' me the president
And you're the baddest I've ever seen, and yes I'm back
Like I never left, all them other niggas are irrelevant
Baby girl you are heaven sent, my baby girl you are heaven sent
Heaven sent

[Verse 1: Lucas & *Ash*]
Look, I got my game tight, ask the question to get the name right
It's late night, hands on the waist, secure that slow whine
That back fine, we can do rounds, call that shit "Fight Night"
Fine dine, after the meal, she sippin' white wine
*Le-le-let us take a picture, get the lightnin' good
Told me your name : Robin, but tell me why you don't like the hood
But now you like the wood, so we can get it crackin', never lackin'
Put yo' back when the lights is off*
Look she blushin', I'm thinkin' 'bout the touchin'
I ain't really cuff it, one night then I'm cuttin', switch lanes
Yeah I'm dustin', either money or it's nothing
Don't know why these clowns are bluffin', 'cause you're not who
She be lovin'
*She say she don't like men but she love me
Kick it easy like Do-Re-Mi, and she bad, she can come by me
'Cause this is how we do it*

[Chorus]
Baby like the way that she peel this
I put her ass on the hitlist
And baby can you feel this, yeah yeah yeah
I wanna get up in your business
And there is somethin' 'bout this girl, she wanna take my heart
And we can get on first class when we fly yard
Baby know I got this and we don't talk
There's somethin' 'bout this bum that goes boombayah

[Bridge]
She say I got her feelin' high like the Everest
Keep on talkin' like you crazy yeah
Now she callin' me the president
And you're the baddest I've ever seen, and yes I'm back
Like I never left, all them other niggas are irrelevant
Baby girl you are heaven sent, my baby girl you are heaven sent
Heaven sent

[Verse 2: Sneakbo]
She callin' papi or the president (presi)
All them other rappers are irrelevant, her batty feelin' good
Feelin' delicate,you know I had to thank God 'cause she's heaven sent
Baby, I been on the low, I've been really ghost, I been gettin' dough
I'm back now, get ready when I ring yo' phone, I pull up to your crib
Beep beep, come we go, Vapiano, then I take you out to my show
How you feel 'bout that, I love her body and damn she got tatts
Bust type, she's nice and got racks, I smile, she smile back
She whine upon me, that whine there too mad
Come here gal, I know you know I'm here to stay
I done told you before I'm stopped playin' the games
I love you like cooked food, are you feelin' the same
She said : "Sneaky I love from back in the day"

[Chorus: Ash]
Baby like the way that she peel this
I put her ass on the hitlist
And baby can you feel this, yeah yeah yeah
I wanna get up in your business
And there is somethin' 'bout this girl, she wanna take my heart
And we can get on first class when we fly yard
Baby know I got this and we don't talk
There's somethin' 'bout this bum that goes boombayah

[Bridge: Ash]
She say I got her feelin' high like the Everest
Keep on talkin' like you crazy yeah
Now she callin' me the president
And you're the baddest I've ever seen, and yes I'm back
Like I never left, all them other niggas are irrelevant
Baby girl you are heaven sent, my baby girl you are heaven sent
Heaven sent
