[Verse 1]
We've been couped up, covered up, snow and rain
This country cabin fever drivin' me insane
Been a long cold winter for way too long
Waitin' on the blue bird to sing me a song
Mercury's riseing and the clouds are apart
And that short skirt walk is already starting
Them buttercups are popping up towards the sky
These cool rays are shading my eyes

[Chorus]
Look theres the sun, here it comes
Summer time has begun
Good time friends where ya been
Come on in have some fun
There's the sun
Mmm ya there's the sun

[Verse 2]
Kick back floatin' easy while the warm wind blows
And you find us makin' memories where the cool breeze blows
And the ocean and the lake and the swimming pool
Everybodies all in staying cool tapping there toes
And swaying along and that ipod shuffle goes to shuffling songs
And them little bitty bathing suits lawdy lawdy
Havin' us a sun screen party


[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Here it comes, theres the sun

[Chorus]
