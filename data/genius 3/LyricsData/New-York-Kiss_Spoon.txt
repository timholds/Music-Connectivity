[Verse 1]
Yes, I got shook up
But bets are good
It took it to another 'til I go back

Now when I show up
It's gonna hit me good
It's gonna blow my mind
Just like the first time
You told me by the neon sign

[Chorus]
And then your New York kiss
I knew you knew your kiss
Now it's another place
A place your memory owns

[Verse 2]
I come fast
I look past
And I know that it won't get to me at all
Until I go there
The feeling hits me clear and sharp
The streets are empty, there's no one 'round
It's a far-off shout, it's a far-off shout
Just like it was when next day came up
And it felt so tough

[Chorus]
From your New York kiss
Mmm, your New York kiss
Now it's just another place
A place your memory owns

[Bridge]
Another place that you own
And it ain't goin' back
Caught up inside of it, yeah
Caught up in the moment
Got it right
God, there ain't a thing I miss

[Chorus]
Not like your New York kiss
Not like your New York kiss
But now it's just another place
A place your memory owns

[Outro]
Right now I know no other time
Right now I know no other place
I say good night
