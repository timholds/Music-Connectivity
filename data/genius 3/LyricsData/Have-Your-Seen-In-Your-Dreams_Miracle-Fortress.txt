In a dream in a day

And a night and a way

I feigned of a love

For the greyness above

In a dream that I'd saved

From a memory of days

Confusion was waste

And the lightness the place

Have you seen?

Have you seen?

Oh, nothing

And the thought of a few

That had truly been new

I savoured as grace

As it lit up my face

Have you seen in your dreams, o love?
