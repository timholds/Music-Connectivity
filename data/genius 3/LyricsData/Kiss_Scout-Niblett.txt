A kiss could've killed me
If it were not for the rain
A kiss could've killed me
Baby, if it were not for rain

And I had a feeling it was coming on
And I felt it coming
For so long
If I'm to be the fool
Then so it be

This fool can die now
With a heart that soared
How
How, had it coming
For so long

And darling take my hand
And lead me through the dawn
Let's kidnap each other
And start singing our song

'Cause my heart is charged now
Oh it's dancing in my chest
And I fly and not walk now
From the spell in that kiss

Cause I...

It could've
It could've killed me
It could've killed me

If were not for the rain

Oh darling let me dream (let me dream)
Cause somewhere in me (inside of me)
I have been waiting (waiting)
So, patiently

For you

You, you

So don't you!

Break!

Don't break my dreams

(yeah yeah yeah yeah)

Don't break my dream

Let rain exalt us
As the night draws in
Winds howl around us
As we begin

What a way to start a fire. (fire)
What a way to break a day

A kiss could have killed me, baby
If it were not for rain

And I had
A feeling it was coming on
I felt it coming
For so long

And I...

It could've!

It could've killed me!
It could've killed me!

If it were not for the rain

(thunder)
