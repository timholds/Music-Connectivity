Waiting for a train
Going nowhere in a nowhere station
Staying up last night
Going nowhere with my trains of thought
Sleeping with your boy
Going nowhere in a long distance relation
Blinded of your senses
By the fear of unrequited love
Once more I woke up in the moonlight
Once more our paths crossed through the night
And a moment's hesitation
Your silent invocation
But you shielded me from your glow
Like a moth against your window
And I'm too shy to stop you in your tracks
Oh you leave me in the dark
Drifting in my boat
Going nowhere with my aspirations
You and me connected
Unexpected in our drifting thoughts
But you still see him
And I am sinking in the storm of separation
Blinded of my senses
By the fear of unrequited love
Once more I woke up in the moonlight
And twice more our paths crossed through the night
And a moment's hesitation
Your silent invocation
But you shielded me from your glow
Like a moth against your window
And I'm too shy to stop you in your tracks
Oh you leave me in the dark again
And I need someone
To stop me from drifting
It's getting late to be travelling
Destined to go nowhere
By the fear of unrequited love
