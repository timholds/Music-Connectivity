Rap verse I
Hey girl remember me
I met you backing 93
Even then, I liked your style
And you got a little thicker now
See my name is montelly-yo
From the Westside of cally-yo
But you can call me big daddy though
Now peep game as I start to flow

Verse I
Baby girl let me talk to you
That's all that I wanna do
I can tell your jeans are new
Just right
And I like
What you do to me
Everything that my body needs
So holla back, cause I feel the need
To turn you on tonight

Chorus
You got what I need
I can see you in them right blue jeans
I been known to make a honey wanna scream

Aight
You got what I need
I see you looking so fresh, so clean
I been known to make a nigga wanna fiend

Aigh
(Repeat 2X)

Rap verse ii
What you know about the dirty south
Late nights at the waffle house
Bad girls that like to bounce
Atl, yeah
That's what I am talking about
Bankhead and krispy kremes
Cadillac's on 23's
Iced-grill that'll make you freeze
Damn, you know what I mean

Verse III
Let me kick this one more time
Look straight into my eyes
When you touch me I can't deny
I get so excited
So, what's it gonna be
You wanna burn some calories
We'll hit the Swiss on Peachtree
You re gonna wake up next to me

Repeat chorus

Rap verse III (Bonz Rap)
M.J lets ride on this one
Doin 105 up 85
What you talking about
The dirty south, and you just entered the prise'
You gotta special way of making me rise
They playing your song you are turning me on
Showing the thong, dance wrong
When we are up in the club
I gotta dub and I am ready to cut
From S.C. to cali
Keep turning it up (it ain't no game) what
She love the dubs on my truck, uh, uhmmm
Let me clear my throat
Keeping it country like chicken and dumpling
Rather have you humping on top of me
Helping Mr. Jordan keep the party jumping
And y'all know, I can't stop till be bottle empty
So turn it all around
From the back girl break it down
Your looking scrumptious now
Gotta hit it get it wow

Repeat chorus 2x's
