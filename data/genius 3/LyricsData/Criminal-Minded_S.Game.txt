Chorus (Nichole Bacovin)

I have no control
Living life as it goes
Never was the life I chose
But it's all I know
So, criminal minded
Criminal minded

This the life I live
Never thinking positive
Done been through a lot of shit
But I'll never quit
So
Criminal minded
Criminal minded



Verse 1 ($.Game)

I'ma be ready to ride, Ready to die
Nothing more deadly than pride
That pride that's resting inside every soldier that's ready to try
To battle the world all alone on his own like Al Capone
Criminal Minded, I stay in a zone
I'm a soldier and making it known
Taking it home as the world revolves
I do what I gotta, not a lotta drama stay unsolved
Believe me, I'm greedy, I want it all
Forever stay clever and never will fall
Staying a step ahead of you all
Haters who hate and wait for me to crawl
Follow me deep in the game and see it all
And think of a reason that i should quit
They thinking of leaving me out they get split
You fucking with something that's starting to get out of control
You thinkin of killing, well bitch I'm feeling the same
Staying real in the game, Never feeling no shame
Dealing with pain, making me think of these things
To make a come up quick, see I wanna get
Paid and made, tired of living day to day
Money on the mind, find me on the grind
Putting money on the line, journey through the mind
Let me show ya where ya find
The fury of a criminal, criminal, criminal
Criminal minded baby



Chorus (Nichole Bacovin)

I have no control
Living life as it goes
Never was the life I chose
But it's all I know
So, criminal minded
Criminal minded

This the life I live
Never thinking positive
Done been through a lot of shit
But I'll never quit
So
Criminal minded
Criminal minded
