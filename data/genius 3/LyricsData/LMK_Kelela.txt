[Verse 1]
Look, I'll give up right away
And you'll never figure out
What you said, but it's cool, baby
I'ma get me another round

[Pre-Chorus]
Saw your face in my lane
Fall in love everyday
You can chase it for the night
There's a place for you and I

[Chorus]
Let me know
It ain't that deep, either way
Let me know
Said I gotta go, don't wanna hear me say
Let me know
It ain't that deep, either way
No one's tryna settle down
All you gotta do is let me know

[Post-Chorus]
All you gotta do is let me know
Let me know
All you gotta do is let me know
Let me know
All you gotta do is let me know
No one's tryna settle down
All you gotta do is let me know

[Verse 2]
You don't read between the lines
'Bout to leave, can you read my mind?
Did you think you're my ride home, baby?
'Cause my girls are parked behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Saw your face in my lane
Fall in love everyday
You can chase it for the night
There's a place for you and I

[Chorus]
Let me know
It ain't that deep, either way
Let me know
Said I gotta go, don't wanna hear me say
Let me know
It ain't that deep, either way
No one's tryna settle down
All you gotta do is let me know

[Post-Chorus]
All you gotta do is let me know
Just let me know
All you gotta do is let me know
Just let me know
All you gotta do is let me know
No one's tryna settle down
All you gotta do is let me know

[Bridge]
I saw your eyes fall right past my waist, so let me know
I ain't gonna wait if you hesitate, so let me know
I don't wait for nothin', baby
I ain't getting nowhere movin' at your pace, so let me know
I don't wait for nothin', baby
All you gotta do is let me know
Let me know, just let me know

[Outro]
All you gotta do is let me know
Just let me know
All you gotta do is let me know
No one's tryna settle down
All you gotta do is let me know
Just let me know
All you gotta do is let me know
It ain't that deep, baby
All you gotta do is let me know
All you gotta do is let me know
Let me know
