[Introduction: News Caster]
The images from this weekend of violence in the streets, stores being looted, riot police with dogs barking and charging at protesters seem like they are out of another era. But this outburst of violence is going on in present day St. Loius Missori. It all started with the fatal shooting by police of an unarmed black teenager

[Verse 1: D. Lynch]
We speak the way we feel, they don't do us no favors
A life was lost, the cops getting no favors
Letting them all know we ain't taking no favors
Getting yours [?] ya, sooner or later
It's on every channel now, just look at the news
It's a civil war here, what does the president do?
He sends out tanks, riot [?] to be used
Against poor people tired, of being abused
This nations askew if [?]
Watching brothers die, put their name on a tattoo
Run and join the navy, [?] something to prove
It's on every channel, just look at the news
A kids dead in the streets, and vengeance is [?]
[?]
And look in the mirror, cause that person is you
