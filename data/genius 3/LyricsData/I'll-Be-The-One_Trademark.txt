Imagine that your heart would beat for me
You know that I'm waiting patiently
Till you're by my side
Every day; every night
Baby you're the one I need can't you see
You know my heart is beating just for you
Baby I don't seem to find the clue
To be by your side
Every day and every night
But I feel my heart is aching without you

Maybe I'll be the one
If you want me here to stay
Maybe I'll be the one
To guide you all the way
No I'm never gonna hurt you
You're always on my mind
And I'll be the one untill the end of time

Sure there is a way for you and me
Together and forever it will be
I'll be by your side
Every day and every night
But I'll feel my heart is aching without you

Maybe I'll be the one
If you want me here to stay
Maybe I'll be the one
To guide you all the way
No I'm never gonna hurt you
You're always on my mind
And I'll be the one until the end of time
