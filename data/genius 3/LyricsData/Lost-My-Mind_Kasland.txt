[Verse 1]
I'm full of mental images I don't pick the mirage
I got a mind that's more sick than aged sticky fromage
This asylum's harder to escape from than a tricky garage
It's driving people crazier than Nicki Minaj
My chick so bad she tried to kill me in my sleep
People say I'm like a stalker, but really I'm a creep
More dudes say I'm crazy less dudes say I'm psycho
It's Halloween baby, and guess who's playing Michael
Unless you get the cycle don't try to understand me
Call me by my first name like I'm Dakota Fanning
They say I'm so demanding, the fans that is
I got people working for me saying damn, that's it
Every time I give an order, cause I go easy on them
The boogeyman is blessed like I keep sneezing on them
The prince still runs his mouth although you'd think S. Beezy shot him
But I think it's too late, damn Sleezy got him

[Hook]
What should I do I think I lost my mind
Wait wait who are you I think I'm lost in time
All I know what to do is just to bust a rhyme
And just go insane, cause I lost my mind

[Verse 2]
Hanging in the alley with every face seen on a bill
Drinking cold beer like we're on King of the Hill
It seems nowadays if you sing you got a deal
Rapper hunting, tell me what to bring and I will
Some rope, machete, and dynamite too
It's a guarantee I'll shank you if I don't bite you
And I don't like to use guns and explosives
Every rapper that sees us runs if he knows us
Get used to me, I'm sick and I'm demented
(I thought he was classy) nope I just pretended
I say the things I say for you to smile and I meant it
To the point that it would be offensive just to be offended
My rhymes are so splendid man they're fat like they're obese
They're gangsta, low tees, gold teeth, and goatees
With punchlines for homies I bear arms like no sleeves
You say you want no beef with me, ho please

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I found a prostitute and didn't pay her, but got busy
She accused me of rape, but I got charged for shoplifting
Thirty days later, her body's gone missing
The cops show up I can feel my balls shifting
Excuse me sir may I ask you a question
Drop the machete or I'll have you arrested
You see this woman have you seen her lately
Say you look familiar from the wanted list maybe
Oh shit they're onto me, what do I do now
Get a fake mustache and hide out in a new town
That's the dude from the asylum, quick, get him
Stay away from me dude, I'm sick, venom
And you don't want to see what happens when I spit
My mind goes crazy like some captain Jedi shit
I bet you think I'm bluffing, hah, don't you
I think I saw something (scream) told you
