[Verse 1]
I know its insane, but I love you both the same
And feelins like that are kinda hard to explain
So I write to let you know what's goin on in my brain
I never meant to inflict any pain, this game
Got way out of hand, which shoulda been a one night stand
Just one experience that wouldn't happen again
Turned into a romance, was hard to pretend
That the feelings weren't strong from when we met
In the least promised of 'em all environments
Introduced by a friend, of a friend of a friend
These things seem to happen when you least expect
Like the streets, got lost in conversation
It's funny how two souls can meet and connect
And a woman can steal a man's heart in a sec
And a second can change a whole life's direction
Sorry love I had no answers to your questions

[Hook]
I'mma be a man about this (about this)
I never thought I'd fall in love with two chicks (two chicks)
And when I did I ain't know which one to pick (which one to pick)
So I apologize to both for what I did
F'REAL!

[Verse 2]
I had three years under my belt with someone else
When you came into my life, wouldn't believe how I felt
Wasn't prepared to throw away everything that I built
Was decieving someone I love, dealing was ill
I was committed to another and I never did lie
To you at least, did want you as thing on the side
To get by, the night before I got inside
I asked to know your last name, you seemed surprised
I could - never forget the priceless look in your eyes
Who would have thought, that I could be one of those guys
But from the start, you were mentally and physically fly
It sparked something in me I just couldn't deny
I wasn't playing, didn't kick any games to entertain
Couldn't get intimate, if I ain't know your last name
And you know there's something there when the night fades away
And the first thing I did was call the very next day

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Everything happens for a reason they say
Was it fate? Could it be that your my soulmate?
Could someone really find true love in such a hard way?
So I started thinking back, was like Coldplay
Which brings me to this letter that I'm writing today
I wanna say, that I don't wanna be in this bond
This heart and mind that's pulling all directions and times
And as the time goes on, get the ticket in line
I know your patiently waiting for me to make the next move
Please understand this the hardest thing I've had to do
How do I tell her I've been untrue?
After so many years prior to our rendezvous
I'm hurting both girls but not by choice
It's not - so black and white to make that choice
But I didn't lie when I said I loved you both the same
I'm just - writing to say, I'm the tell of the day
