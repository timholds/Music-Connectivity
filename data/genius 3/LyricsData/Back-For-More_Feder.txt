[Verse 1]
Being young is beautiful
Everything I want and more
Could have been everything
Now you've gone, we've lost it all

Black cards, going yards
Hotels, gold stars
Never waited for my love
Now you've gone, we've lost it all

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby when you're in
And he's done breakin' your heart
When the bottle's empty
And you've tasted every drink in the bar
Running out of real love
Feeling like you're on your last straw
I'm not there to fill up your cup
I know that you'll be coming back for more

[Chorus]
You, you wanna play with fire
You know what I'm gonna say
I know that you'll be coming back for more
Now you saying I'm all yours
But I heard it all before
I know that you'll be coming back for more

[Verse 2]
Okay, magazine, sold out, stories
Hope it was worth it
Now you've gone, we've lost it all
First class, VIP pass, backstage, all access
You trade it all for love
And now you've gone, we've lost it all

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby when you're in
And he's done breakin' your heart
When the bottle's empty
And you've tasted every drink in the bar
Running out of real love
Feeling like you're on your last straw
I'm not there to fill up your cup
I know that you'll be coming back for more

[Chorus]
I know that you'll be coming back for more
You, you wanna play with fire
You know what I'm gonna say
I know that you'll be coming back for more
Now you say it, I'm all yours
But I heard it all before
I know that you'll be coming back for more

[Bridge]
I know that you'll be coming back
I know that you'll be coming back
I know that you'll be coming back
I know that you'll be coming back for more

[Chorus]
You, you wanna play with fire
You know what I'm gonna say
I know that you'll be coming back for more
Now you say it, I'm all yours
But I heard it all before
I know that you'll be coming back for more
