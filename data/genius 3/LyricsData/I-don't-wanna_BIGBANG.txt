(Are we rollin? Yeah!)
(1, 2, 1)

You want love and you want it to last
You want and don't wanna hang on to your past
The sound of summer's creepin' into your brain
You feel so alive, wanna have it going in again, but

I don't wanna hear you singing
Don't wanna think about things that I've done
No, I don't wanna hear you playing
No more strings on me, anymore

I feel love, but do I want it to last?
I want and don't wanna hang on to my past
A lot of things we do fill me with joy
But I'm not gonna stop being such a whining little boy

I don't wanna hear you singning
Don't wanna think about things that I've done
No, I don't wanna hear you playing
No more strings on me, anymore
Hey, everybody! We're just walking on the beach tonight
Wade in the water, and solve all our troubles on the other side

They started throwing clothes out of the window
Trying to settle things beyond repair
Somebody's phone will always be ringing
Somebody's always gonna not be there

I don't wanna hear you singning
Don't wanna think about things that I've done
No, I don't wanna hear you playing
No more strings...the other side!

I don't wanna hear you singing
Don't wanna think about things that I've done
No, I don't wanna hear you playing
No more strings on me, anymore
Hey, everybody! We're just walking on the beach tonight
Wade in the water, and solve all our troubles on the other side
