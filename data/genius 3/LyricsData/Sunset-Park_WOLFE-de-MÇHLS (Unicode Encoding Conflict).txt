[Intro: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
I don't wanna waste your time
Waste your time
Don't wanna waste your time
No, oh no

[Verse 1: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
I just wanna know your name
I just wanna see you again
Can I see you again?
My love
I don't remember your name
No I don't
No I don't

[Hook: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
See I don't wanna waste your time
Lost on a lonely road
Go now
I don't wanna waste your time
Lost on a lonely road
Don't wanna waste your time
Waste your time
Waste your time
See I don't wanna waste your time
I don't wanna waste your time
Lost on a lonely road
Right away

[Verse 2: BIG K.R.I.T.]
Uh, lost on those lonely roads, like
We ain't got no where to go, besides
You better off right beside me, like
Smoke a little bit if you like that
If I wrote you a song, would you write back?
I never was the type to run game
And you know like I know that those lines
Like "Girl, what's your sign?" type lame, so
How about I start off with who hurt ya?
What's worth it?
What good is look if it ain't perfect?
We all bear our emotions but do yours ever surface?
Do your dreams come true when you give your all?
Or do your nightmares worsen?
Are you looking for someone that you can always call?
When you closing your curtains
Looking in the mirror at your lingerie purchase
With more curve than cursive
Hit me on Skype to the club I like
'Cause you had to try it on and you dig my verdict
One thing for sure
It's two things concerned
I wanna blow your mind
I don't wanna waste your time, shawty

[Outro: WOLFE de MÇHLS]
I don't wanna waste your time
I don't wanna waste your time
See I don't wanna waste your time
I don't wanna waste your time
