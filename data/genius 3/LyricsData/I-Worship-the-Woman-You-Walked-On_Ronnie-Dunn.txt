[Verse 1]
You don't wrong the heart, of a woman that loves you
You don't turn your back on her tears
The arms you leave lonely, won't wait forever
(You know what?) That's why I'm here

[Chorus]
'Cause I worship the woman you walked on
I hold her at night, 'til she's satisfied
Oh, I try to right all you did wrong
I worship, the woman you walked on

[Verse 2]
I'll bet the wrongs haunt you, the should-haves, the want-tos
Are ghosts now in your empty bed
You gave up her soft touch, turned your back on her sweet love
You must have, been out of your head

[Chorus]
Oh, I worship the woman you walked on
I hold her at night, 'til she's satisfied
Oh, I try to right all you did wrong
I worship the woman you walked on

[Chorus]
Oh, I worship the woman you walked on
I hold her at night, 'til she's satisfied
I try to right all you did wrong
I worship the woman you walked on

[Bridge]
Oh, I worship
Oh, the woman
You walked on

[Outro]
You don't wrong a heart, of a woman that loves you
You don't turn your back on her tears
