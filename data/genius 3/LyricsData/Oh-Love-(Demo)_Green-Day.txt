Oh, Love!
Oh, Love!
Won't you rain on me tonight?

Oh, Life!
Oh, Life!
Please dont pass me by!

Don't Stop!
Don't Stop!
Don't Stop when the red lights flash!

Oh, Ride!
Free Ride!
Won't you take me close to you?

Far away!
Far away!
Waste away tonight!
I'm wearing my heart on a noose!

Far away!
Far away!
Waste away tonight!
Tonight my heart's on the loose!

Yeah!

Oh Lights!
And Action!
I just can't be satisfied!

Oh Losers!
And Choosers!
Like the darkness of the day

Oh Story!
Same old Story!
Won't you see the light of day?

Far away!
Far away!
Waste away tonight!
I'm wearing my heart on a noose!

Far away!
Far away!
Waste away tonight!
Tonight my heart's on the loose!

Please don t go away tonight
Please don t go away tonight
Please don t go away tonight
Please don t go away tonight

Oh, Love!
Oh, Love!
Won't you rain on me tonight?

Oh, Ride!
Free Ride!
Won't you take me close to you?

Far away!
Far away!
Waste away tonight!
I'm wearing my heart on a noose!

Far away!
Far away!
Waste away tonight!
Tonight my heart's on the loose!
