Grey eyes link these--sharp dawns
Bird-chested
These cornered arms
Half-lit, mirthless, marksman
Of bamboo chute & charm

I took your portrait from the wall
And your picture at the window
Sucked you lemon dry and wept--
Deep in the hall

Who would swallow my life?
And leave me as a child
In the whale I can see the bone
And the muscle in dim-light
Who would swallow my life?
And leave me here to die

In these arms I can feel my home
Breaking from inside

Who would swallow my life?
And leave me here to die
In these arms I can feel my home
Breaking from inside
