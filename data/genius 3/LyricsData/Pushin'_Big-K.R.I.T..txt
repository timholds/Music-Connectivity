[Intro:]
Aye what it is young shorty its ya boy young Krizzle man
I stay on my grind and my hustle
I'm tellin' all my folks out there in the street lets keep on pushin' shorty what it is

[Hook:]
Be at the block on the grind
Be at my beats and my rhymes
I tell myself all the time
They die at least so I'm a
Be at the block on the grind
Be at my beats and my rhymes
I tell myself all the time
They die at least so I'm a

[Verse 1:]
They don't wanna see me get that ride
Pull up in a [?] 405
Lay with me in bed, cuz' when I earn mine
I'ma smoke it real slow like when I burn mine
Already touched down now I'm about to takeover
Niggas gonna hate but I'm a motherfuckin' soldier
Full of that G shit payin' my dues
Pussy ass nigga I got nothin' to lose
Make it in the Sip, then I take it cross' state
A hundred thousand krits thats a whole lotta' weight
Watch him get it off, he'll make it happen
Ask me what to call it I say "all the dope traffic"
Lately young Krizzle been on his grizzle
I gave up the block but I'm sure she miss me
Niggas in the industry all about their bullshit
They ain't never let me in so I keep on pushin'

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I ain't another one of them puppets that they puttin' out
I fucks with the hood and truly represent the south
No respect for niggas that don't write they 16
Scared another nigga thought he say he MC
Should of never made it since my changer
Shorty all them tattoos don't make you a gangsta'
You slowin' down the game cuz' your shit ain't nice
Never struggle once so you fabricate your life
They don't wanna see a [?]
Hoggin' all they pesos
They s'posed to need them like they steal roids' and I'm Canseco
Flake hoes, gettin' brushed off my shoulders
And I won't stop till they careers is over
Get in the spotlight pimp, can't shake your past
Come down here flashin' and we'll take your ass
Lotta niggas in this game, that I won't cool with
They don't wanna see the [?], so I gotta keep on pushin'

[Hook]:

[Outro:]
That hood fame you heard shorty
