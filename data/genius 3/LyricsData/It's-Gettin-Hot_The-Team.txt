I'm tryna see what it do [4X]

[Chorus]
That fifth of hyp'
That's what she'll lick
That got her wildin' out
She wanna get ripped
Go ask your chick
Find out how I get down (damn)
It's gettin' in here (damn)
Act up till the cops get here (damn)
I got the whole block in here (damn)
So you could get it hot in here (damn)

Ask that boy 'bout stuntin'
He'll tell you about something
Every time ya in the club wit me (wit me)
I rip though the line
Need no cosign
Everybody wanna hug on me (on me)
Pull the trunk from behind
See that boy shine, look at them dubs on me (on me)
Nothing less then a dime
Clyde Carson will find a chick who wanna rub on me (on me)
Age eighten and up
Meetin chicks who strip with g-strings for bucks
To the flo', tryina see this movement
Pull dimes like Dash in Clueless
I'm off them grapes
Purple and blue shit
Riding in a coupe, the same color as cool whip
She foolish, with tacky pointers
She ain't nothing but a runner like Jackie Joyner

[Chorus]
That fifth of hyp'
That's what she'll lick
That got her wildin' out
She wanna get ripped
Go ask your chick
Find out how I get down (damn)
It's gettin' in here (damn)
Act up till the cops get here (damn)
I got the whole block in here (damn)
So you could get it hot in here

[Hook 2X]
Let me see you move it, move it
Let me see you hit the floor
If you ain't with it, with it
Then you can hit the door

You know I'm so Bay wit' it
Athletic A's fitted
Thirty plus chain inches on me (on me)
I'm with Jungle and Mayne, My nigga Dame Fame
Yeah I got that thang on me (on me)
I ain't one for the talk
Man I pop a couple shots
That boy gonna plop on me (on me)
I got twins involved
The twin menage
Massaging and they both got their hands on me (on me)
She's a runner and a ripper
Pro-style gel and beauty supply slippers
Get your gear right, get your fist up
I'm talkin fahrenheit, ma, switch your swiss up
Need to switch up, break bread
Another night, another hype, on the bay bridge
More purp, more pills, the basics (Go Go)
Now that's Bay shit

[Chorus]
That fifth of hyp'
That's what she'll lick
That got her wildin' out
She wanna get ripped
Go ask your chick
Find out how I get down (damn)
It's getting in here (damn)
Act up till the cops get here (damn)
I got the whole block in here (damn)
So you could get it hot in here

[Hook 2X]
Let me see you move it, move it
Let me see you hit the floor
If you ain't with it, with it
Then you can hit the door
