Make this heart of mine smile again
Give this heart of mine high hopes again
It don't do nothin' but cry
And if you don't come back soon, I know it's gonna die

Make these eyes of mine see once more
Make this soul of mine feel good like before
It don't do nothin' but cry
And if you don't come back soon, I know it's gonna die

Heaven only knows how much I miss you
Forgive and forget, come back and let's start anew

Hear this heart of mine beat once again
Make this heart of mine feel it's still as a friend
It don't do nothin' but cry
And if you don't come back soon, I know it's gonna die
And if you don't come back soon, I know it's gonna die
Yes, if you don't come back soon, I know it's gonna die
