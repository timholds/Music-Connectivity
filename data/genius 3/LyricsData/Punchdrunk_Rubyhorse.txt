Everyone is out of it
Everybody here has lost control
Traveled eyes and dirty minds
Take the kids outside and lock the door

I'm like the man on the flying trapeze
I feel so close to the stars
But on the ground is where my feet belong

Inside here is an answer
I'm punchdrunk but I'm free
Inside here is a spirit
Don't you see?
Don't you see?

Have no fear of anything
They'll turn you inside out and front to back
Don't drown your sorrows or hang your head
I'll come for you
I'll hold you 'till you crack

I'm like the man on the flying trapeze
I feel so close to the stars
But on the ground is where my feet belong

Inside here is the answer
I'm punchdrunk but I'm free
Inside here is a spirit
Don't you see?
Don't you see?

You and me
We're worlds apart
And far from home
But in this life
We're on our own
A one man show

Inside here is an answer
I'm punchdrunk but I'm free
Inside here is a spirit
Don't you see?
Don't you see?
