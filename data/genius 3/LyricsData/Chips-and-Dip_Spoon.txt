[Chorus]
When she's got to say goodbye
After staying out late on a weeknight
And I walk on the side of the road
Under industrial lights
It can be such a shame
How short the night and day

[Verse]
All that I've been for so long
Is trying to get right here
And sometimes I can't make myself shuck and jive
Perfection's on her tongue rolls out in monotone
That's where the heartache goes
And I do the same you know
I do the same you know
Here's the final row
I do the same you know
It's just you can't see it
Chips and dip

[Chorus]
When she's got to say good-bye
Staying out late on a week night
Sometimes I can't make myself shuck and jive
Cause where the heartache goes
I do the same you know
I do the same you know
