Everything... Ain't a thing without you here in my life
(You s*** hottie, you got that body, you make things right)
Ain't a dream... 'cause the way you hold me hits deep inside
(So sweet like honey, right on the mone, blowin' my mind)
Everyday as I wake I'm whole
You got me feelin' so fresh and good to go
My friends think that I'm crazy, yo
Well, I'm about to get crazy some more

Cause every little thing you do turns me on
(You turn me on)
And everytime you speak you touch my soul
(You touch my soul girl)
It's everybody's dream to be in love for oh so long
(Just want your body on my body body)
Girl anything you need is in these open arms
(These open arms girl)
We'll fly together free wherever you want
(Wherever you want)
Cause you're my everything
(My everything)
Every single thing
(Every single thing)
Everything
(Oh oh oh oh oh)

Let it rain
(Pour down your love)
Wanna take you on a special joyride
(You s*** hottie, you got that body, you make things right)
That's the way, in the mornin' afternoon and the night
(So sweet like honey, right on the money, blowin' my mind)
Everyday as I wake I'm whole
You got me feelin' so fresh and good to go
My friends think that I'm crazy, yo
Well, I'm about to get crazy some more

Refrain

Yo yo yo, just me and my honey she's my one and only
Baby likes to do her thang
What you talkin' 'bout homie
If you didn't know me T-O-P got that bang
And it's bigger, see me when I shoot lyics pull the trigger
Many wanna rock this but they can't figure
What it's all about no doubt
Steady dedicated to my girl gotta give a shout

Yo, that's word, ya heard she's mine
Every little thing she do so fly
Specially when she rock the gucci
Lookin' mad juicy definitely one of a kind
That's right I'ma be by her side

And I'ma keep it real tight
(Really tight)

She's gon' be my sweety every single day and night
For the rest of our lives

From here on out we cruisin' in luxury, yeah
We're gonna take it to the next century and forever
