[Verse 1: Omen]
The neighborhood ball player
Quiet, was shy around them girls
Who knew that he would fly around the world?
I never crawl for nobody, see I did a lot of baby stepping
I came a long way from 87th
I'm with some pretty girls chilling out in Sweden, out in Paris
Thinking do I deserve all of these blessings I inherit?
I've seen a lot in my life, the kind of things make you rewind twice
Now, it's lime light, but wait, you see, something is missing
Let me tell you about this juxtaposition
I'm on tour chilling
Chiefing with, my rent due back home, I had to call my mama
I guarantee this changes your perception
See, y'all ain't really got a clue
Fans coming to my shows want more money than I do
And it really gets no realer than that
Gotta know I'm fearless now if I'm giving you that

[Hook]
I need a ceremony
Hey, I need a ceremony
Cause I done came a long way with even further to go
But before I finish the show
I think I need a ceremony
Aye, I need a ceremony
Cause I done came a long way with even further to go
But before I finish the show, yeah

[Verse 2: Omen]
Somebody told me, "What's confidence without belief?
What's a city full of gangs left without a chief?"
Thanking God, I made it this far
I have overcome the undertaken
Came through the storm, but another one's awaiting
Under dog love from fans, hoping they ain't traitors
Turn around a year from now, well time is full of hatred
I've seen it happen before, so if I gotta face it, I'm ready
I'm still looking for Mrs. Right, or at least Mrs. Right for the night
Nobody knows what this life is like
Family functions friends weddings are sacrificed
All just to write and recite some words from the mic
But this is all I got and this is all I have
I let my work and my craft speak on my behalf
A southside Chi city boy is my testimony
I think it's time we had a ceremony

[Hook]
I need a ceremony
Aye, aye, cause I done came a long way with even further to go
But before I finish the show
I think I need a ceremony, yes
