Come here lil mama I'm feeling your vibe
Come here lil mama I'm feeling your vibe
Her body ferocious this choppa ferocious this car is ferocious
We came from the bottom we slept with the roaches
I slept with the carbon I slept with that draco
I pop me a seal and put that in a faygo
I pop me a perc and leave of this earth
She spread her legs when I go in so focus
Bought me some land out nowhere to grow it
Yeah I'm the plug and these lil niggas know it
Yeah I'm the man and these lil bitchs know it
She spread her legs when I go in so focus
Bought me some land out in Denver to grow it
Yeah I'm the plug and these lil niggas know it
Yeah I'm the man and these lil bitchs know it

Verse 1

Bitch I'm a plug I'm connected
I hope that the feds don't detect it
You lil niggas better respect it
These lil bitchs know I'm the man that's a given
I'm traffic and trafficking and I'm dodging prison
I came from the bottom from fucked up conditions
Come here lil mama just open your thighs
Come here lil mama I'm feeling your vibe
I slept with that draco I slept with that carbon
I still remember all those days I was starving
I still remember all the niggas I shot at
I still remember all the niggas I shot at
I fuck her so focus
I'm trapping so focus
I came from the slums with the rats and the roaches
I plant the seeds in the water and grow em
How he a plug and I don't even know him

Verse 2

I go inside her
Lil mama a rider
My platinum is fire
My OG is fire
He not a plug he just a liar
Lil bitchs know I'm the man
I drop a brick on a fan
I use to traffic in minivans
I turned my city to Amsterdam
I turned my city to Denver
We get that money like we can go print it
Snatch up the profit and go start a business
Snatch up the profit and start another grow
Lets the plants dry and sell them for the low
Lil mama body so gorgeous
I trap out a fortress
I go to Mexico and bring that pack on some horses
Ferrari with horses
Porches with horses
(You know what it is lil nigga)
