[Verse]
Way too young for the ring ting
Now you wanna dance on a king ping
Sixty-eight plus one, that's a win-win
Time to slide in like a penguin
You don't need ice, no bling bling
No hubby, no wife, just a friend ting
Live your whole life to the ending
There's no point pretending
Let's be friends, with benefits
We can chill, and Netflix
No strings, like Hendrix
Let's pimp, like Kendrick

[Chorus]
Let's go deep into a world, that only we can see
They can't touch us, they can't judge us cuz we're crazy young and free
It's not me troubling you
It's not you troubling me
Can I trust you not to love me?
Let's be FWBs
FWB, FWBs
FWB, FWBs
