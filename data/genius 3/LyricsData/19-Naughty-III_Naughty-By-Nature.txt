(Intro)
The brand new beginning
A brand new year
The season of the cruddy niggas (ha!)
The super producer Kay Gee is in the mother fuckin house
And on the microphone, the naughty boy number two, Vin Rock is in this place (ha!)
And finally the king of the panty raid, punani don Treach, wrecking up the set (ha!)
Now coming straight from a hundred and eighteenth street, Ill Town, East Orange
Naughty by Nature introduces, ha, the year we take no shorts, Anybody caught dissin, we’re takin it straight to your mother fuckin face. Ha. And we ain’t bullshittin. Ha. Haha

Nineteen ninety three three three

Word

Here we go
Come on

(Verse 1)
As long as I can shit solids and piss liquids I'ma kick it
I ain't got to say I'm wicked scalping ass whippin tickets
And for those who has to swear we stay here
We don’t relief to the streets nobody in there helped us outta here
Pile up the switch up
Switch up the style up
Say something fouled up
You come to step to us
I say you’re towered
Go and get your neck knocked off
Get a wreck off
So step off
Before you wipe the floor like a step cloth
They like to do all
Jumpin hoes on low
Like judo
My bite
Leaves your brain feeling light
Like to heav- you know
You know I ought flows ago
Cause my version go
Having mo than yo
Toe to toe and much mo in sto
Keep you nose on my dough
How much I made?
Don’t get dis grin
Just know my income comes in
There's really nothing left to throw
Tell us wheres the flow to show
Uh oh so here we go

Come on
Oh here we go

(Verse 2)
You ain't hard enough to hit wind
Knock down breath fight through rain
Here's the perfect record
Starring rappers where's my name?
And if you can’t say hello at the same show
Then don't sit your R&B ass in the same row
Cause I might have a fit yall
I might try to twist your wig off
And tell you when the hits off
Prissy ass of the week
Has a dissy ass of the month
Papa just says he rappin to a sissy slum
End all for your whole body snotty oh no
I got more talent in my shrinkin stinkin pinky toe
I didn't know how many rhymes that flow
I sprouted talent
Started music in my notebooks all that counts
So it's time to make em shout
The way we feel we might drop another album two days after this one comes out
Word to rap
I won't let
For no one to know
Ho
So here we go

Come on
Oh here we go

(Verse 3)
My circle working hurt the urkel
Now the vietical skirt show jerk
They get so fat they get had by the mad circle
And what you gonna feel
How you gonna feel when I flow oh
I wanna know I wanna know I want to know
Yo
I'm the fear of the year
Yeah I'm that fear
And I'm the same trigga nigga from last year
A plenty of MCs is lackin
Writin slicker I'm whippin
And if your girl is missin that's the new kitten I'm hittin
So don't put out an A.P.B
Put out an O.P.P
Done by you know me he he
Hanging like a tassle
Honey wanna wrassle
I tear you a new hiney like the rotten rascals
Past hoes have no place to roam
They're alone
So find them on thier asses
Send the hoes home
And best not have an attitude
If you every ho with an attitude
If I stomp you that should flatter you
Never dis the flavor unit cause well do a battle
You punch it out of you
They might want to battle you
We got tricky hes for the tricky shes
We got La, Salt N Pepa, Yo-Yo, Lyte and Nikki D
And they come figure in the higgy G
And how your lost ass was found is still a fuckin mystery
And you can bring any one friend
I'll leave you crying like an onion walking crooked like a bunion

Come on
Oh here we go
