Elevator for the cars, where you sit yours?

(Easier said then done) Killa
A lot of dudes talkin 'bout they don't care about jail
That (?), I tell 'em
(It's easier said then done)
You ain't been down on hund', Center Street to that DA's office
Have you, huh?
(It's easier said then done)
Or niggas talkin 'bout, "Yo, shoot me dog, I'm real"
Know what I tell 'em

Know about that six hour surgery, two years worth of therapy
Two paralyzed fingers, yaknahmean?!

[Verse 2] + (girl)
(Killa, uh) uh
So what I made a million, I'm chillin, a straight civilian
I know on the plate is killin
But I'm here to save the children
I'm a hypocrite, every day I play the building
Where the hero? But this hero, play the villain
That's the way I'm feelin, had to replace the ceilings
Landscape, and I swear
Got my neighbours grillin
So I cop some acres, God, to the top you take us
He know we not some fakers
Every day the cops come chase us
Not what they make us, we the minority
Wanna be the majority, skybox, watch the Lakers
So I could ball like Lucille
In the mall, I'm too real (he is real)
And I don't care at all how you feel
I'll fall if you squeal (they will squeal)
And ya bank account it's on Slim Fast
Drink down ya slim ass, up in a M-Class, Killa

(Easier said then done)
I know a lot of y'all schemin on me out there
One thing's for sure, two things for certain
(It's easier said then done)
Fuck around, get ya cap clapped backwards
Better all wait to Friday to fry fish, nigga
(It's easier said then done)
Then y'all niggas talkin 'bout y'all gettin money, man
Y'all don't know about hustlin
(It's easier said then done)
Her-on's like the stock exchange, nigga
Price go up, price go down
Nigga could sell you all paper, what's really good
