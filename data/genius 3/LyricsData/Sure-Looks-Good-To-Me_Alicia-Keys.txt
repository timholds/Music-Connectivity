Hoo hoo, hoo hoo
Yeah yeah yeah
Hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo
Yeah yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Life is cheap, bittersweet
But it tastes good to me
Take my turn, crash and burn
That's how it's s'posed to be

[Hook]
So don't rain on my parade
Life's too short to waste one day
I'm gonna risk it all, the freedom to fall
Yes it sure looks good to me

[Verse 2]
Time passed by and leaves you behind
Take it naturally
Heaven knows there's so much more
More than what we see

[Hook]

Hoo hoo, hoo hoo
Yeah yeah yeah
Hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo
Yeah yeah yeah

[Bridge]
Deep in my mind I'm secure with getting by
Wanna see the light before I die before I lie in an empty space
The darkness comes and I've been telling my soul
In me and myself we turn around, we're getting old

But the lightning crashing, foolish emotions
Of the bruises and the beauty of this moment that we're feeling
And I feel like I'm seeing the world inside of me
But I can tell you that I know it's getting easier to breathe

There's a cold in the morning, endless equation
Of who we've become it's a complex situation
So live love life, give love, live love life, give love
Live love life, give love, 'cause who are we anyway?

[Hook]

Hey, it sure looks good to me
I'm tellin' you it sure looks good to me
Yeah, sure looks good to me

Hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo, me, yeah
Looks good to me, hoo!
(Hoo hoo, hoo hoo hoo)
Yeah yeah yeah
