[Verse 1]
All it'll take is just one moment
And you can say goodbye to how we had it planned
Fear like a habit, run like a rabbit out and away
Through the screen door to the unknown

[Bridge]
And I wanna love you and more
I wanna find you and more
Where do you reside?
When you hide, how can I find you?
Cause I wanna send you and more
I wanna tempt you and more
Can you tell that I am alive?
Let me prove it

[Hook]
You and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
Hear my voice, know my name
You and I, we're the same

[Verse 2]
Left like a pharaoh, sing like a sparrow anyway
Even if there is no land or love in sight
We bloom like roses, lead like Moses out and away
Through the bitter crowd to the daylight

[Bridge]
And I wanna love you and more
I wanna find you and more
Can you tell that I am alive?
Let me prove it to you

[Hook]
You and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
You rejoice, I complain
But you and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the
You and I, we're the same
Hear my voice, know my name
You and I, we're the same

[Bridge]
I wanna love you and more
I wanna find you and more
Where do you reside?
When you hide, how can I find you?
Cause I wanna send you and more
I wanna tempt you and more
Can you tell that I am alive?
Let me prove it

[Hook]
You and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
You rejoice, I complain
But you and I, we're the same
Live and die, we're the same
You and I we're the same
Hear my voice, know my name
You and I, you and I
