Chorus
There's something I'd like to say
And it goes a little something like this anyways
I wasn't born rich, but not poor either
I got the latest gear, cell phone and beepers (x2)

I got the whole collection of Jordan sneakers
My man had the sweeper
He my gate keeper
I've been cool with niggas you don't fuck with either
I never sold crack, never sold reffa
I've never really been the street fighting type
But did throw down when I needed to right
I'm calm but to be mistaking like
Some push over nigga you can take of the mic
I used to be the nigga playing basketball
Yo every wrong call, son we used to brawl
Team jerseys must of rocked them all
From NY to LA to teams up North
Of course nowadays I got a new hustle
I got a brand new way to flex muscle
No longer will I tussle got no time to waste
I got songs to write and beats to make

Chorus

I popped all four of my moms speakers
I told her one-day she get a 2-seater
A Benz, a Lexus, whatever please her
100,000 on a platinum visa
Niggas keep saying "D" you bugging son
Well maybe I'm just bugging them
The pad and the pen that's my life my friend
I gotta thanks my staff and my next to kin
And y'all wasn't ready but I brought you all in
To the my rhymes, my style, the legend begins
Niggas like not him, but I'm live in the flesh
Denim is Guess
Gotta get some shit off my chest
I've done told niggas growing up is tough
Now you got younger niggas to be selling the stuff
And wise older brothers that be getting locked up
Niggas see the hand, but can't call the bluff

Chorus (x4)
