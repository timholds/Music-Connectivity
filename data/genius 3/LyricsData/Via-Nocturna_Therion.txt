Part I: "The Path"

Deep in the wood, in the dark, there's a way (Via Nocturna)
Follow this path and you'll meet a strange crowd (Via Nocturna)
In the forest you will meet
Silhouettes of your dreams
Dancing on the path you walk
Things you have frightened
You now find so sweet
On the path of darkness
Your wishes become real
On the crossroad you will meet
What your heart desire
Take a glance upon the shadows
On you see your face in them
When you wake up you wish
You will sleep again

Part II: "Hexentanz"

Follow Via Nocturna and Luna
Join the dance of hexentanz
And meet the Mephisto
Follow Via Nocturna and Luna

All this fauns and weird companions
Moonstruck witches and their demons

"Follow the nightway and become one of us"
So says the celebrants of the hexentanz
They gather at Brocken, on hills and the seas
Dancing to the flute of Pan until dawn
They will show you strange worlds of the night
Land of the moonlight and of dark memories
Caress the lady who is leading the dance
Know her name is Lilith â€” the queen of the night
She tells you secrets in the form of an owl
Open your inner passions and desire
"Here in the wilderness we are really free
To do our true will and to be like the beasts
Some call us barbarians and we are proud of that
No passion is forbidden, no pleasure or pain
I can show you a paradise you've call a sin
We do our true will and call it Arcady"

Via Nocturna, the path of Nahema
Via Nocturna, will lead you to Lilith and to Pan

In the deepest forest
In the deepest dark
You will find the fire
And this secret path

When you wake up you will believe it was a wonderful dream
And that you never will caress the lady of the night again
But you will at once when enter the Via Nocturna
