Check check ...this happened for real ...baby bash..yo.. frankie j.... obession)

Its early in the morning
And my heart is really lonely
Just thinkin 'bout you baby
Gots me twisted in the head
And I dont know how to take it
But its driving me so crazy
I dont know if its right
Im tossin turning in my bed
Its 5 oclock in the morning
And I still can't sleep
Thinkin 'bout your beauty it makes me
Weep
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I dont know what to do i think i'm in love
Baby...........

[Chorus]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Than what am i feeling
What am i doing wrong
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Its just an illusion that I have in my heart

Now I know you're not my lady but i'm tryin to make this right
I dont know what to do Im going out of my mind
So baby if u let me kick it witchu then well maybe we could ride together
We could do this all nite now I dont care if you got a man
Baby I wish you'd understand
Cuz I know he can't love u right, quite like I can
Its 5 oclock in the morning
And i still can't sleep
Thinkin bout your beauty it makes me
Weep
I'm feeling hopeless at home
I dont know what to do i think i'm in love

[Chorus]
Amor no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am i feeling
What am i doing wrong
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart

I love the way you freak it like that
I love the way you freak it like that
I love the way you freak it like that
Its an obsession

[Baby Bash]
Hold up let me dream
Shorty got me feelin serene
Where my candy, where my cream
Got your boy feel less supreme
Hold up wait a minute baby you so damn independent
Loving everything your representing
Got alot of money, I love to spend it
And thats whats up and I dont care what people scream
No im blessin when im stressin
My superfly beauty queen
Im gonna keep it saucy
Cuz my ma know how I do, we go rendevous, MI CORAZON BELONGS TO YOU

[Chorus]
Amor ...no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am i feeling (what am i doing wrong) what am I doing so wrong [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart
Amor ...no es amor (if this ain't love)
Then what am i feeling (what am i doing wrong) what am I doing so wrong [echo]
Amor, no es amor (if this ain't love)
Is this an illusion that I have in my heart

Amor
