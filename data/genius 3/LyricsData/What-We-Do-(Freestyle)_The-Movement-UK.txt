[Verse 1: Wretch 32]
I'm saying 2-13 didn't really have the best for me
In the studes cooking up, thought I had the recipe
Still things are looking up, I believe in energy
Last few months I made a quarter mil festively
God, why you testing me? How you let my granny die?
Every time I drive past her house, have to wipe my eye
I would trade places with her now just to see her fly
That day I put her in the ground left me traumatised
Still I crack on, hit the bar every night
I could have a girl every day but I won't have a life
They just wanna go on a date, they wanna grab a bite
If I put you in the frame, you'd get camera shy
Flash flashing, my pupils have had enough
It's like all eyes on me, but it ain't adding up
If I had a penny for every smile, every pause
I'd peel off like a tangerine but I cherry doored
Fruity, when your diamonds don't have any flaws
That's when you're like Lord Sugar-
Pardon my French, but that's just the desi talk
Ballers who uplift their ends, that's who I support
So, I told em pass through
Barbecue, even had a bouncy castle
That's cause in Tottenham I'm like their Dizzee Rascal
My ends gunning for me, know we've got arsenal, come on!
See, I love it when my brothers come home
If I'm going to Italy, my brother come Rome
I threw in the next key, my brother just drove
Mercedes back to back, that's what I call grown
I guess we've come a long way from them pissy flats
Mad-smelling, vomit in the stairs, I got sick of that
Some cats sticking up my dogs when we're in the trap
That's why it's called a deadly race, it's a deadly lap
Yeah, see when I never had any fans
I was on the wheel of fortune, tryna pedal grams
Wrong spin, got a caution when I was heading back
Counted, I had more blessings than petty cash
Yeah, I guess anyone can do the maths
Mad, now one verse costs a thousand raps
Mad, I swear there ain't nothing to subtract
Now all my Os come in the bank
Lately, I've been thinking 'bout my highs and lows
Been on the side of the bus like Dynamo
Had no ticket on the bus, way out my zones
Now inside my tour bus is kinda like my home
I say "father, thank you for everything"
My team's blessed, my manager bought a wedding ring
We sleep less, we channeled thoughts, yes we did
Neatly-dressed on the cats' walk, I get it in
In, in, penny for your thoughts
You could have a fuck failing, ah, hold on, hold on
You could succeed failing, unwritten law
The Titanic ship was going down before taking off
So I ain't taking off, the pacemaker's God
I'm like earth, wind and fire, I can take the fall
Before I take the loss, I rip my label off
I rip the paper out my show, leave my agent cloth
Run and run across the roll and get written off
But what I'm saying, I'm same Jermaine, I'll never change
It's a liberty that my statue isn't in the States
I'm writing a book, my brother, I'm on a different page

[Verse 2: Scorcher]
I ain't designed for this industry cause I've got it in for me
Rappers that I run off in person are record-dissing me
Certain times they've got me feeling like I'm going mad
I left the robot last year, I've started going back
Give it a flow blud, I ain't showing no love
I just lost 10 fucks all cause of a grow flood
So fuck everybody rapping 'bout the cashing out
Fake rapper, that's the shit you never rap about
All I do is fuck gyals, do shows, write lyrics
You see the niggas round here? They're my niggas
Started from the sandpit, gravel in their eyes
So if I die, them man'll turn [?] tonight
Yeah, Everton's cool but we own it
Make sure you're playing by the rules when you rolling
But fuck all of that bullshit, my baller brother's a millionaire
Every time I go to his spot, I wanna live in there
Yeah, it's got me feeling inspired
It's the bark, steel flow, I've been preeing the wire
Man are chatting 'bout they're fly but they ain't seen on a flyer
Ayy listen, oy, fuck you know?
I've done a hundred shows, couple tours up and down the country
As long as I'm writing lyrics, my son'll be living comfy
I never used a pen and paper when I wrote this lyric
Cuh everything I do, boy that's [?]
I was sitting in a dark room, tryna find a light switch
Grandfather died, it felt like I had a side stitch
The pain in my heart, but I had to man up
He was there when I was crawling, when he left I had to stand up
Looking at my son tryna extend the legacy
As for his mother, I'll do anything 'cept a wedding ring
'Cept a wedding ring, they can't lie
You see they're beings with bad habits, they can't die
I started on the [?], then I got the whole one
Then I got the two and a Q, fuck, I was moving a few
Then a half bar, then I got the Obi
I skipped out the 80, jumped to the oakies
Then I brought my cousin in, I could put my trust in him
Same grandparents, natural born hustlin'
Alex [?], dropped me a 35
I clocked that, the P's live

[Verse 3: Mercston]
They can't change me, remember riding round in the summer
No AC, silver Ford [?] 200
Round 80, me and fucking Stacey
I ain't fucked with dem gyal in a while though, facety
Rah, tell a pussyhole face me
I'll fuck you up nigga, then don't play with me
Back to the flow though, me with dem gyal [?]
On the way to the MOBOs, before I left I took a photo, black suit, sharp shoes and an auto
I've got [?], hit the gym
Gyal dem say my lines are like DeAngelo, yeah
I used to see a girl that went St Angela's, swear
Believe that there, as we reach back there, what we do is wrong
While sipping on a Ciroc amaretto, your girl
Told me that I'm special
I don't know the cause but I came in with a rebel
I don't know where Wretch is, but Scorch is there on the table
Give me the rest a statement
I swear to God, I'm finding it hard to stay faithful
I'm on the grind, bitches be inboxing me their navel
[?], I swear it's on the table
Almost covered in maple, shit
I really need to take in what my granny said, I'm gonna marry kush
Need to clear my mind, I can't believe that my granny's dead
I never show emotion but as of late, I've been panicking
Dad's going through some shit, gotta be around for him
Can't let him down again, UGH!
The feeling in my heart when my granddad went, BAH!
Listen, I needed some seconds to stay composed
So when I'm out burning this bread, I'll make a toast
YOLO, that's only in the flesh though
On my second innings I'll be chilling with the lost ones
Playing Lauryn Hill in the motor, constant
I ain't chatting a guy like Ronson
Got a princess, I don't wanna die though
When I'm in the Merc, it's me and her fucking side-on
We travel round the world, Valentine's was in the Eiffel
Both sides she was in the [?] in the eve, that's in the Bible
I'm a maestro, you already know the flow goes like this
Ice code, tekkers, swerving like lino
[?] Richie, Lionel
Going through the city, alright go

[Verse 4: Ghetts]
May the Lord forgive us
We've been sinning since Adam and Eve
Is Eve short for evil?
Cause she forced the apple down Adam's throat
We're all feeble when there's bad involved
So, so
I'm making money while I'm making bad decisions
What I mean is making money could get a nigga back in prison
J Clarke was Ray Charles before I ever had a vision
What they say about hindsight?
It's 20/20 when your mind's right
So, looking back
Before I had a foot in rap I had to pull a strap
A minor violation is something I couldn't have, I just [?]
After weighing good and bad, Wretch
I never thought I would adapt
Call a nigga [?], would've got a fucking attitude like
"What the fuck you looking at?"
I was too hype
Now look at man
Tryna move right
Rapping from experience
Literally, rapping from experience
So this is the girl that missed her period
Baby on the way and now you have to look way beyond the day
This shit is serious
The days have gone away when we were creeping in the backdoor
And yeah I got a beating when my dad saw
Hated my dad for that
So at the time I was like "what the fuck are dads for"?
Never realising that most of my friends fathers all departed after dramas
And never came back or even made a phone call
Man are like "Ghetto you don't know, at least you had yours"
This could be the reason why niggas are anti-social, it's so true
This is life as we know it
Before Channel 4 decided to show it
Think they know about the... (I'll catch it, I'll catch it)
Look, there's Shane and Sully
Would they remain buddies?
Cause look at what the gutter does
Sully hit rock bottom and [?] fucked his own cousin
Feds watching til they come for us
Charlie, little [?] for mothers
They're in the mix and they're guaranteed to fuck him
And catch a [?] before he suffers
Kamali's in a ditch, we don't live in no suburbs
So you wanna be the Top Boy
So now you're putting work in on the block boy
All the brothers are rating you but your dog's moist
He'll be in the end, so everyone wanna box Floyd
Why? Cause we can all talk a good fight
If I swing with my left, you won't look right
But when Rafe comes around
Don't ask what he's doing with his [?]
Goodnight!
I'm reminiscing bout the good times
Me and my niggas on our push bikes
Now we smoke [?], paint the town red
Sell the [?] and we push white
I'm a dark skin nigga living colourful
Ask a hater why the hell I'm on his mind so much
When's the last time you gave your own Mum a call
You talking bout me?
She's struggling with the shopping and she could've fell
Down the stairs, backwards, doing somersaults
Oh, you're a father?
Buy your son a ball
Take him to park and let him run around
Instead of acting like a wall for this juggernaut you mother-fucking clown
There's levels to this shit
Don't talk to me unless you're levelling with this
Top 3, top 5, top 10, top 20
You ain't never in the mix
