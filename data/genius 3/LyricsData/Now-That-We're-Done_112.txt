(Daron)
Ooooohhh!
Oooo!

(Slim)
Got to try my best to reach the lowest low
To a place where no one goes
If you let me taste your soul
I'd let you taste my funky emotions
And I'll cover you with me
In a pool of ecstasy
There's no place I'd rather be
Then with you
Please let me do you again

(Hook - with Slim adlibs)
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Body's so soft, just can't stop thinkin'
You touch me there, what are you thinkin', ooh
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Body's so soft, just can't stop thinkin'
Here comes the sun, now what are you thinkin', ooh

(Mike)
Lying here on a bed full of trust
Just don't fully cover the lust
Anticipating all of the questions I'll ask
Was I strong enough or will I last, I don't know

(Daron)
It's kinda hard to play this right
These feelings that I have inside
Is something that I just can't, can't hide

(Hook x2 - with Daron adlibs)

(Daron)
Do it again
(Slim)
Can't believe how this feels
The feeling is unreal
I got to know now that we're done
Now that we're done, what are you thinkin'
Can we do it again and again and again and agian
112 won't you help me sing it

Hook

Slim Adlib until fade
