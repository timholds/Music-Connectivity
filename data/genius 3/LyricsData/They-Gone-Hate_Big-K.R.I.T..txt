[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, Young Krizzle
What up, what up, ay ay
The boy is back, what up Walley (the boy is back)
New day and era man, new flow
[?] new [?]
I like this shit right here, it's real smooth
(I't's real outside the box) Check this out

[Verse 1]
Breathe with me, the wait is over (ah)
[?] deserve the crown you're holding, yeah
The future lie behind my Cartier lenses
I do me great so fuck your [?] pimpin
Rather stick to the streets and the code
Outflow a nigga damn near thirty years old
Not to be boastful but I'm so focused
Folk knew I was blowing way before I wrote this
My debut, I skate through
They love me so much that they must hate you
I call you're shawty Wednesday you call her your boo
She give me mouth to south and still dates you
I call it how it is, speak it how I see it
Too many kept [?] sparks in these regions
OG's taught me, told me don't save em
It's something like video games you just play em
Like

[Hook]
They say we're trafficking
We say we trappin'
They like, I blew by accident
They gone hate but they don't know
They hate, they hate, (don't know)

[Verse 2]
I went from nobody to that next nigga
I went from no shine to diamonds on my neck nigga
It's a level of respect nigga
That I get from trap stars, hood hoes and them vet niggas
I speak when they ain't speaking
Touch the hearts of those they ain't reaching
I'm a hood [?]
I sit in the poor pit
And if it ain't about money then I bet it's on some bullshit
Ain't I bulshittin' either people
Either you catch ghost or that Pac man eat ya
Sliding deep in the game like wet wet
Mo fire, Mo hoes, Mo latex, safe sex
I take [?] for 06 & 07
I'm paradise with the flow my shit is so heaven
Heavenly father wait on me
The same reason they hate on you is why they hate on me
They don't believe

[Hook]

[Outro]
Young Krizzle
Three hundred third coast
What up Walley
Hood Fame shawty
What up [?]
They gon' start respecting me as a artist
Versatile with vocab shawty
Killin em
06 my year nigga
Most anticipated, yeah
