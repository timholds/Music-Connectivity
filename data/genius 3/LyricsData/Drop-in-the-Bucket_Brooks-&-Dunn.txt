[Chorus]
It's just a drop in the bucket until the bucket fills up
Until the bucket fills up it's just a drop in the bucket

[Verse 1]
It's a wildcard drawn until you draw to a pair
Then you draw another pair and you're getting somewhere
Just a penny on the street until you stop and pick it up
When you stop and pick it up, it can change your luck

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
Oh, it's just another day until it turns into night
Then the lights get bright and you feel alright
And it's just another pair of old cowboy boots
Until you're on that floor and you start to move
It's just another song on that old guitar
Until the old guitar makes you a star

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
A shot of brown liquor and a smoky bar
Can make you a little bit better than you are
A small dance floor and a long slow dance
Can turn into a real romance
Take a chance
It's just an innocent kiss until it feels like this
When it feels like this then you just can't miss
She ain't nothing but a dream until you find that girl
When you find that girl she can change your world

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 4]
Take a long hot day and some bright sunshine
To make a little thing called summertime
Take a walk out on the beach and a tender touch
Make a little thing called love
Talking sweet love

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
