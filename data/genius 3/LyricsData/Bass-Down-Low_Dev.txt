[Hook: Dev]
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

[Verse 1: Dev]
It's like one, two, three, fuck it
I'm about to take this drink and just stuff it
Fish tank this thing along with four more shots of Patron
Don't give a fuck about going home
Straight buzzin', Robotussin
Wanna get your mitts in my oven?
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'?
G-g-g-get a lick of this lovin'?

[Hook: The Cataracs]
Yeah, I like it loud and I'll make you shout
Give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that Boom Boom Pow

[Hook: Dev]
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

[Post-Hook: Dev]
Drop it to the floor
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
To the floor
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Drop it to the floor
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
To the floor
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

[Verse 2: Dev]
It's like one, two, three, okay
Can I get a little Goose in my O.J.?
Everyday feel like my birthday
And we sip champagne when we thirsty
Quit fronting, why yo husband tryna get his mitts in my oven?
Wanna get a lick of this lovin'?
G-g-g-get a lick of this lovin'?

[Hook: The Cataracs]
Yeah, I like it loud and I'll make you shout
Give you that Black Eyed Peas
You know that Boom Boom Pow

[Hook: Dev]
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Ba-ba-bass, bass, bass down low
Bass, bass, bass down low
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

[Post-Hook: Dev]
Drop it to the floor
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
To the floor
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Drop it to the floor
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
To the floor
I like my beats fast and my bass down low

[Bridge: Dev]
I got a question for you
Do you like it when I flow?
I got a question for you
Do you like it when I flow?
With my bass down low
Like la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la

[Hook: Dev]
If you wanna get with me
There's some things you gotta know
Drop it to the floor
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
To the floor
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
Drop it to the floor
Bass down low, bass, bass, bass down low
To the floor
I like my beats fast and my bass down low
