[Verse 1]
You've stood too long with your tears in the doorway
I guess I've run out of the right things to say
You've made up your mind that he'll make you happy
I don't have the heart to stand in your way

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe tonight you think you're in love
But baby tomorrow when you wake up

[Chorus]
Just remember, when he looks at you
He don't see what I see
That little girl smile, that woman in your eyes
That always got to me
Just remember, when you turn down the lights
Who you're really reachin' for
Yeah he can tell you he loves you
But I love you more

[Verse 2]
I was the one, that told you he loved you
You were afraid, you couldn't be loved
An' I was the one, who you could believe
Would never leave when times got tough

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'll never say I told you so
But take this with you when you go

[Chorus]
Just remember, when he looks at you
He don't see what I see
That little girl smile, that woman in your eyes
That always got to me
Just remember, when you turn down the lights
Who you're really reachin' for
Yeah, he can tell you he loves you
But I love you more

[Outro]
Yeah he can tell you he loves you
But I love you more
Oh, he can tell you he loves you
But I love you more
