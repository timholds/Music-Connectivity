[Verse One:]
Remember my name, this ain’t a game, it’s a mission
To clear the radio of this similar repetition
My style’s different, unloading a lyrical murder
I’m speaking, sending a message these people have never heard of
Word up, I take you back to the days of believing
Right now I’m mentally bleeding ‘cause nothing holds any meaning
You see what I mean with no character demean, you think that it’s entertainment
(I’mma shut down the screen)
Do or die, who am I? I’m an artist
If you ain’t want a problem you shouldn’t have got me started
Once I’m in I ain’t leaving, you better hope I don’t make it
‘Cause I don’t care about the throne, I wanna take it and break it
Politics and Hip-Hop, what happens when it flip-flops?
When everybody struggles in attempt to be the tip-top
And through it all, they’re telling us it ain’t safe now
Prepare for the (x3) Break Down

[Verse Two:]
Consider me the overseas champion, Regal
I’m making major moves and still labeled “barely legal”
Don’t show up to the battle if you ain’t ready
When I strike my hits will be coming steady
(Never let me get) around the mic, I got a sound that’s like
Putting a stereo around the brightest light in the night
And then when it shines these lyricists are enlightened
They tried to make a diss track, and fell back, and quickly got frightened
Look, I ain’t feeling sorry, you’re supposed to be a man
So if that’s really what you claim then get up and take a stand
People claimin’ that they hard, just because they get violent
If you ain’t fighting through your lyrics then your anger stands silent
If I’m rapping I’ll only be saying one thing
Don’t call me the Fresh Prince if I’m a young king
And through it all they’re telling us it ain’t safe now
I’m told ‘em to prepare for the break down
