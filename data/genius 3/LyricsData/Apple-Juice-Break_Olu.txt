Apple juice break
Apple juice break
Apple juice break
I'mma hit you with that chill flow, you know what I'm sayin?
Apple Juice Break

[Verse]

Sippin on a tropicana apple juice
Sittin on the porch of the house on the corner of the avenue
Took a quick breather, finished all the shit I had to do
Got the whole day to myself, so I grab a few
Royal blunt wraps and roll up a queen latifah
Big, phatty, king-sized L of sativa
Put it in my ear, while puttin on that Wiz khalifa
Curren$y, How Fly, and listen to it while Im chiefin
Light up with this orange lighter titled "Ed Hardy"
Dont remember how I got it, think I found it at a party
You know like when you borrow lighters, but forgive to give it back?
Kinda like that, happens all the time, but I ain't mad
Its god's way of cuttin us a little slack
Appreciate it, a lot of a little bit is all Ive ever had
Thinkin bout the way things work while I relax
Sit back, hit the blunt, lookin for a place to ash
Use the FRESH box that I made in ceramics class
Like 8th grade or something, Look at how the time's passed
That was back in like Two-thousand and five
Back when I was against doin drugs, but now I only get high
And make music. Still ain't really into drugs though
Just bud. And bud ain't even a drug, its just smoke
Can't lie though, Ive tried a few of em
But they just werent for me, I had better shit to be doin
And places to be going, music to be made
I'd rather spend the seconds of my life doin something great
But when you work as hard as me, you gotta take a break
Everyone now and then, play some music, pack a bowl and blaze...
Playin gucci mane and yellin burrrr, like a damn fool
While doin a lame dance, but never felt so cool
Enjoying myself. Its my favorite thing to do
As I throw the roach away and take a sip of apple juice
Olu
