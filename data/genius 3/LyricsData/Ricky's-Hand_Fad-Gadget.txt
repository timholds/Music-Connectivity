Scratched his head, then pulled his ear
Reached out for a glass of beer
Ricky's hand
Ricky's hand

From the pocket it pulled five pound
Ricky bought another round
Ricky's hand
Ricky's hand

In the dark it found his zip
Wiped his mouth when he was sick
Ricky's hand
Ricky's hand

Ricky's hand
Ricky's hand

Six pints later he waved goodbye
Picked his nose and squashed a fly
Ricky's hand
Ricky's hand

Slamming the door it grasped the wheel
Now Ricky's full of man appeal
Ricky's hand
Ricky's hand

Ricky contravened the highway code
The hand lies severed at the side of the road
Ricky's hand
Ricky's hand

Ricky's hand
Ricky's hand
