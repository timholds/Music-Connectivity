ROGER:
I was just a paper hanger
No one more obscurer
Got a phone call from the Reichstag
Told me I was Fuhrer
Germany was blue
What, oh, what to do?
Hitched up my pants
And conquered France
Now Deutschland's smiling through!
It ain't no myst'ry
If it's politics or hist'ry
The thing you gotta know is
Ev'rything is show biz
Heil myself
Watch my show
I'm the German Ethel Merman
Dontcha know
We are crossing borders
The new world order is here
Make a great big smile
Ev'ryone sieg heil to me
Wonderful me!
And now it's...

CHORUS:
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
Goose-step's the new step today

CHORUS MEN:
Bombs falling from the skies again

CHORUS:
Deutschland is on the rise again

ROGER & CHORUS:
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
U-boats are sailing once more
Springtime for Hitler and Germany
ROGER:
Means that...

CHORUS:
Soon we'll be going...
ROGER:
We've got to be going...

CHORUS:
You know we'll be going....
ROGER:
You bet we'll be going...

ROGER & CHORUS:
You know we'll be going to war!!
