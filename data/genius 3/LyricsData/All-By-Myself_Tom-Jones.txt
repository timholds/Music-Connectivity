When I was young
I never needed anyone
And making love was just for fun
Those days are gone

Living alone
I think of all the friends I've known
But when I dial the telephone
Nobody's home

All by myself, I don't want to be
All by myself anymore
All by myself, I don't want to live
All by myself anymore

Hard to be sure
Sometimes I feel so insecure
And love's so distant and obscure
Remains the cure

All by myself, I don't want to be
All by myself anymore
All by myself, I don't want to live
All by myself anymore

All by myself, I don't want to be
All by myself anymore
All by myself, I don't want to live
All by myself anymore
