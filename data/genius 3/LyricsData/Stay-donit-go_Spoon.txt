Keep believing the things that you tell yourself
Everyone needs something they can tell themselves
To hold on to cause after all of it's said and done well you know

Confession is stay don't go
Ooh it is
Ooh let's stay don't go

At times you find that the truth is the best way out
Ooh well now sometimes telling the truth is the best way out
And it's the wrong words that make you prick up your ears
When later alone

Confession is stay don't go
Ooh it is
Ooh let's stay don't go

Confession is stay don't go
Ooh it is
Ooh let's stay don't go

Stay don't go
Stay don't go
Stay don't go
Stay don't go
Don't go
Stay don't go
Don't go
Stay don't go
