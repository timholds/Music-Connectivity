[Verse 1: Tiara Thomas]
Guess I can't trust nobody no more these days
They talk behind your back, then smile to your face
Now woah, but I don't pay attention
I don't even mention no niggas bitches damn
I'll be out the way before they catch me slippin'

Cause if you're not telling secrets
Why the cops show at my little cousin's house
And lock him up just for some reefer?
Two years, haven't seen him, haven't seen him
Every night before I go to bed I pray to Jesus
And I say to him

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Tell me something I don't know already already
About these niggas
I bet you say anything, now tell me
Tell me something I don't know already already
About these bitches
Oh they can be so phony

[Verse 2: Tiara Thomas]
But I don't pay no mind, no I don't pay no mind
Cause uh uh uh, bet they'll need me before I'll need them
No one can take this smile away from my face
Can't take my joy
I'll get over it, you... no I will but

If you're not telling secrets
How come she knows that I been fucking with him
But he's in love with her
I don't hear a word, now somebody

[Bridge: Tiara Thomas]
Never let these bitches catch me slipping
They be on a mission
These bitches is itching for the stitches
Never let no nigga break me down
Never break me down, never break me down
Hey, now
Never let these bitches catch me slipping
They be on a mission
These bitches is itching for the stitches
Never let no nigga break me down
Never break me down, never break me down
Hey, now

[Hook: Tiara Thomas]
Tell me something I don't know already already
About these niggas
I bet you say anything, now tell me
Tell me something I don't know already already
About these bitches
Oh they can be so phony
