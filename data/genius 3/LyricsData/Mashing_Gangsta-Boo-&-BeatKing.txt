[Chorus:]
I be mashin, I be mashin, I be mashin for that paper [x2]
When ya broke they disgrace you, when you all then they hate ya
On my wrist it's a glacier, bought that bitch with some paper
I be mashin, I be mashin, I be mashin for that paper [x2]
When ya broke they disgrace you, when you all then they hate ya
On my wrist it's a glacier, bought that bitch with some paper

[Verse 1:]
Mashin and I'm killin these bitches
Hustle gang truly ridiculous
Witness, how I be turnin these posture bricks
Main solo, I don't need no pickin shit
I'm mashed out in my drop-top
I got my broad-top on and my bank roll on me
Most of you hoes be phony really all up in my business
Tryna act like you my homies
Mane, I got it made, later threw the shade
I got a 100 ways that I can get paid
They already know, if they wanna see the gangsta
They gon have to come up with a whole lotta fuckin paper
I rather do the dirt all by myself
Fuckin with the boss is why ya fuckin with the help
I'm mashed out with my wrist out
Cuz I been gettin money where the dollarz at

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
When I’m broke, they don't answer no phone-call
Treat me like I neva sold a million records, ya’ll
I'm yo bitch, I'm yo boo, pullin up in Beverly Hills
Music loud in that coupe, valet tellin me to chill
I am a gangsta fo real, been askin you bitches to quit it, please
You snitched and you thought we ain’t know that you did it
Because you acquitted, leave
Niggas be stealin my flow
Tryna treat me like a hoe and it's on
Funny cuz you bitches only be secretly hatin
But be at my shows
Bad trick, I am the shit
Mashin and dashin for what I'mma get
You playin the layin while I'm makin hits
I'm walkin on sand; I'm rich as a bitch
When I be broke, they don't answer the phone
When I'm on tour, I be missin my home
Gate is protected and gated by drones
Always on point cuz I stay in my zone

[Chorus]
