Oh, I'm like a bat outta hell out to shoot number nine
Well, I'm looking for eight, Lord, it's been along time
I'm tied to the hot seat in the heat of the battle
You gotta give it all you got just to stay in the saddle
Yeah, Well I ride em high and ride em low
The only life for me is the rodeo
Gotta pot of gold waiting in every town
I gotta ride this horse down
I got a one horse trailer, gotta a dually truck
She'll use a tank of gas, come on lady luck
I live high on the hog, I eat pork and beans
Lord, I sleep off the whiskey when I dream big dreams
Oh, Well I ride em high and ride em low
The only life for me is the rodeo
Gotta pot of gold waiting in every town
I gotta ride this horse down
--- Instrumental ---
Pretty girls slide through my heart like the wind
You know there ain't no future in cowboy men
Well, I can take a bull and I can take pain
Ain't gonna climb on board that old heartbreak train
Yeah, Well I ride em high and ride em low
The only life for me is the rodeo
Gotta pot of gold waiting in every town
I gotta ride this horse down
Yeah, I ride em high and ride em low
The only life for me is the rodeo
Gotta pot of gold waiting in every town
I gotta ride this horse down
I gotta ride this horse down
I'm gonna ride this horse down...
