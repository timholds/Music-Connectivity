[Hook: 1-Kemo  2- Kaos]
1- From my block to yo block
I'm on that eastside
2- Who is heard or what about them
On the eastsiiiiiiiiide
1- From my block to yo block
I'm on that westside
We're undercovers wit them bulletproof vests right
From my block to yo block
I'm on that southside
Derty expecting bout a g string on his mouth now
From my block to yo block
I'm on that northside
Where them gorillas thurl wig-splitters let them sparks fly

[Verse 1: Kemo]
Where yo heart lie, in the middle of College and Carter
Where Cast slaughtered his daughter
Now you askin Kemo where was he brought up
Down on Sherry where nobody's scary, where bodies get buried
Catchin fools like Donald Ferry, on streets like Hotter Than Terry
John and Prairie, Al Cogbeed and Blood Nathan, funerals, bridges
And deacons, a different wake every weekend
Them cats on Accomac be creepin
Pullin them Jags 3 deep and four on Audubon tried to catch me sleepin
Rollin garashee in a Cherokee jeep and while they tried to stop my shine
Like Benesian, dumpin out of '81 Perisian, everybody duckin for cover
As I keep releasin, releasin without no reason

[Bridge: Kaos]
They speedin, left speakers rollin up to the spot
And we do it like you do it in St. Louis, its hot

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kaos]
Came up in the dub wit Crips and Bloods
Sellin dimes and dubs from Murdaville back to Marine Va
My dertys on the grind in Pine line from 25th and State to Charlie
Parked back over to Baden
Split Clairdale all day in M.L.K. and Penrose
Shaw, Po-9, Dolman, Ma. King, Gerding Spring, Queen's, Shreve, Pope
There's too much traffic on Maffitt, Russell and Billon
The ones that keep it in the humps in they trunk
Rollin the ones in Hunts and smokin at Fishdale
What about Wells win, in the cell, Robin coppin, Page Dale
