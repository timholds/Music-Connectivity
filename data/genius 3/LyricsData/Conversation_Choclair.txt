Soltair:
Let me take you through the mind of a man drivin mad by the rhymes
In case you misunderstood the first time round Mastermind
The head honchoI'm in the bass claf while you singin' soprano
Mono we MonoLet's take it there this year
No fearSolitair breaks the silence then my words hold clear jack
Some niggas don't know how to act
So bring it backAnd teach you 'bout this skill called rap
You dead waste LaToo bad we can't see eye to eye
Cause I'm a man and you're a victim of the fashion B
ISee I handle my B.IYou could see by
The way my shit keeps you open like your daughter outside
Let the rhythm rideYou close the front and we sneakin' in the back

Deranged characters outta rangeGate keeper squeezing my flow

AChoclair:

You either gonna love me or hate meSpin me or tape me
Envy or under-rate meShit's ridiculou
SYou fuss cause we crazyAbout to make a century eventually
Ya fly high schemes will leave you winglessYou hate us
No need to differently a tallFrequentely, Not I know bequently
Much comfortablySit back and hangRide through on black horses
Buck constantly be pullin' rangsWhen I come throughI be stomping
While others tip-toeand hot clothesI'm like a mustang
Before the foreigns took itWack when they first came
Then tryed to come backwith a bunt down spotForget the ?? stains
I'm the house in the gameQuick fingers
I'll take ya pussySwitch ya pussy, pull a black gauge
Never thought of changeI'm referring on a mountain terrain
With four runners who be jumpin'When they hear the name CHIZZAY
Yo for real ahI ride smooth like a flat hillay
From Tee Dot to Yankee Cali to ShankeeLa, tear da roof
Off da hizzayyo for shizzayHow we rol
When you with the Suave Diggy Dog!!Patna!!
