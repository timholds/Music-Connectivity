Jlo
Feel it getting closer
Stirring like I'm supposed
To Stop me, no sir
Haters getting closer
Stirring like I'm supposed
To Stop me, no sir

When you make it you were chosen
Say, damn you in trouble
Mama told me stay out of that corner
Thank God we made it out that corner
Going crazy, now them suicide doors
Irs watching your money on the forbes
Shorty on me got a bag
Haters wanna see me in a body bag

My head's killing me
I'm losing sleep
And I'm waking up tired of it all
Early in the morning
And there's something already
With my name always involved

I try to get rid of the baggage
Fake friends I call them "has-been"
Yeah, they mind all stuck
And it's ok if they don't show me love
No

They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I've never fallen off

Why you tryna put the world up
On my shoulders?
Get off of me
Get off of me
Too damn grown
I don't owe nobody
Get off of me
Get off of me

Why you tryna put the world up
On my shoulders?
Get off of me
Get off of me
Too damn grown
I don't owe nobody
Get off of me
Get off of me

Cuz in the end I'm still the same girl
(same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
I'm just the same girl (same girl)

Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)

Show me what I gotta do
I'm tryna make it clear to you
Not dealing with the attitude
I'm tired of tryna make you see that
I'm still me
Switched up my longitude and latitude
You're in my way, you better move

'Cause I'm on the same ground No
I never changed
I'm loving every day
I know that I'm the same jenny from
Around the way

They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I've never fallen off

Why you tryna put the world up
On my shoulders?
Get off of me
Get off of me
Too damn grown
I don't owe nobody
Get off of me
Get off of me


Why you tryna put the world up
On my shoulders?
Get off of me
Get off of me
Too damn grown
I don't owe nobody
Get off of me
Get off of me

Cuz in the end I'm still the same girl
(same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
I'm just the same girl (same girl)

Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)

I'ma keep on growing
Keep on shinin' Just wanna do me
I had to thank
God 'cause he chose me

I'm still the same girl

When I was dead broke
There was nobody

Back to the walls, nobody
Still the same old nigga
Thirty new cars, thirty chains
Oh nigga
Been real, count money, get it hot
Oh la la
Been real, count money, get it hot
Oh la la

Why you tryna put the world up
On my shoulders?
Get off of me
Get off of me
Too damn grown
I don't owe nobody
Get off of me
Get off of me
Why you tryna put the world up
On my shoulders? (up on my)
Get off of me
Get off of me Too damn grown
I don't owe nobody
(I don't owe nobody)
Get off of me
Get off of me
