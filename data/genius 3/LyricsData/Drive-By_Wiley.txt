[Verse 1: Wiley]
Nobody's safe in the war, I know this, nobody's safe
When I step into the field I can't see nobody's face
Roll through like a Highlander, call me Wiley MacLeod
I tell people who don't want to see her twerking: 'Listen, Miley's allowed'
If I get called by a worthy opponent then I'm all up for it
I'm highly skilled in a battle, that's why I might push my luck with it
Don't give a fuck with it, like, who's chucking it?
Fill the clip with the lyrics, put the clip into the gun and start bussing it

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Wiley]
If I ever let a war go it means donny can't test with the flow
Oh no, might get pissed because you never got a shot at a pro
To the shit there's levels, and real like rebels, and I'm one of them
I might get called out by amateurs but I don't know none of them
Ready? I'm ready
Make a spitter fade out like Blackberry
I spay a whole crew of spitters cos I'm that heavy
Don't back out if they start attacking me
I tell an MC 'You must prepare for war'
Frontline any time they declare war
Lyrics in the clip, get ready, no discussing it
I put the clip into the gun and start bussing it

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiley]
I drive by on MCs, take shots at them
They take shots at me, the whole lot of them
I wonder who will bail out on a slick one
Cos I'm like thunder when I strike them down on a quick one
See, I've got an aura, sick one, check it out
And the spitters on my team don't mess about
Dons who ain't ready for the war
Then get them out, see them stepping out
The others stepping up, you can't forget about
That's why I put the lyrics in the clip, no bluffing
Then I put the clip into the gun and starting bussing
