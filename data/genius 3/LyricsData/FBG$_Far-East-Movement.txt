[Intro: MIKNNA]
Going out every weekend
Spending all of my money
Now that I'm alone
I ain't got no time for lovin’
Ooh oooh I don't know what to do with myself
Ooh oooh I don't know what to do with myself
(Don't know what to do, I don't know what to do)

[Chorus: MIKNNA]
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T]
I'm talking dolla dolla dolla dolla bill
She fuck for free, I tried to feed her, bring that beer
I'm never drinking, that's some shit that I ain't used to
But if they throw that pussy at you, what would you do?
I gotta knock it down like I do to Caddy doors
I gotta flip it like screens when I'm on fours
I told her get down and get down on the floor
The type of freak [?], you never know
We on that layer, tryna pair us, force us on the slash
Owing to the lights, the whip look so dramatic
Why dodging it, dance, speeding through the traffic
To get home and bust these bands on that ass
Big bang bro, we flexin' it to the max
Money make her come, she don't know how to end
If it ain't fucking bitches that gettin' straight through the wealth
Shawty, I don't know what to do with myself
Krizzle

[Chorus: MIKNNA]
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money

[Verse 2: Far East Movement]
Living on airplane mode
Never wanna change with the LA flow
Different shoes different legs through the valet doors
Put you on the payroll not your everyday hoes
Private with the pimpin keep it tinted Benzo
Fuck bitches, get riches be the fuckin M.O.
Cause I innovate, I don’t play with imitate dough
Stay cuttin’ mad fishes up Hattori Hanzo

[Far East Movement]
Flippin' scales, sippin' pales
Robbin bad bitches blind, watch me fingerbang in Braille
Pin the tails, yo I never fail
Gimme one night with the fatty, kill the kitty, then I wish it well
Playa by the code, feed ‘em thru the nose
White bitches diggin’ like an interview in Vogue
Frosted with the cinnamon, I'm fuckin’ witcha both
Four queens with the king make a muthafucka fold

[Pre-Chorus: MIKNNA]
Going out every weekend
Spending all of my money
Now that I'm alone
I ain't got no time for lovin’
Ooh oooh I don't know what to do with myself
Ooh oooh I don't know what to do with myself

[Chorus: MIKNNA]
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
Fuck bitches, get money
