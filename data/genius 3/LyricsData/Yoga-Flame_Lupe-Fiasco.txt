[Lupe Fiasco]

I call this one Yoga…Flame

Uh, meditate
On the floor, fold your legs, resonate
Breathing speed, regulate
Clear my mind till it levitate
Dhalsim, I beat the game
Level 8, Hella good
Never great cause God is great
So ain’t no goats, ain’t no gates
Fences see the rams ram, lambs let, sheep’s skate
Brace yourself, teeth straight
Fix your face for Pete’s sake
Birthday wordplay, piece of cake
Fold the flow with seats for eight
Ororo Munroe, make it rain
Not with bills, I make it change
Take that cool shit, make it lame
Take that nerd shit, make it bang
Yeah, you heard us make it bang
Yeah, you heard me make it bang
Melt the change and make a ring
Take that ring and make a bracelet
Take that bracelet make a chain
Look how far my necklace hang
Connect that chain up to a crane
Pull the game up by the brains
Could not move it just with brains
So I had to use some bling
Shouts to Drizzy, shout to Wayne
Yeezy, Jeezy, Ricky, Fifty, Raekwon, Loso, Gucci Mane
I’m not going to drop my name
Sneak that message to the masses, you can call me Chocolate Rain
You might think my wallet drained
Look how far my pockets hang
That’s cause I got pocket change
My net worth is basketball
They net worth is soccer games
Tell them niggas stop it mane
But they cannot stop it mane
So, they forced to watch it drain
They be looking so blue like water when I wash my jeans
King without the whoppers and, King without the cobbler
And King and I ain’t got no dreams
Bruce Lee, dishwasher
Cleaning out your pots and pans
These niggas ain’t got no stain
Power once I hit them with the powder
Then throw em’ in the shower
These niggas slower than some dial-up
I be on my broadband
These niggas still downloadin’
Lu finished, you still up on YouSendIt, uShare, zShare
How long you going to be there?
Damn…
FinallyFast.com for you fam
Information super highway
These niggas ain’t got no lane
But you can ride my shoulder
Like they pulled you over
I sit in the driver’s seat
You sit on the sofa
I am Patrick Swayze
You are Whoopi Goldberg
Cause he was a beast and the way that he controlled her
Rest in peace to Patrick
Rest in Peace to Stacks, kid
Rest in Peace to Rap, no, rest in peace to wackness

Yeah, nigga, I whacked it
Baby boy with the glasses
Tears like a black rap Zach Galifianakis
Hangover, game over, nigga that’s it!
