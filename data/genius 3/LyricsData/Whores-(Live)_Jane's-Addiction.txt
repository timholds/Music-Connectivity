Way down low where the streets are littered
I find my fun with the freaks and the niggers
I don't want much man give me a little
Or I'm gonna take my chances if i get em
I love them whores they never judge you
They cast that pearl and it don't upset 'em
They take their chances if they get 'em
Hear me go off!
Give me some more!
Motherf*cker!
Need a little more!
Goddamn you!
Give me some more!
Motherf*cker!
Give me some more!
You give me breadcrubme uh-ho
I'm tired of living the bosses dream
They'll squeeze you dry man if you let 'em
Better take your-take your -take your chances
If you get 'em
Her me go off!
Give me some more!
Mother f*cker!
Need a little more!
Goddamn you!
Give me some more!
Motherf*cker!
Give me some more!
