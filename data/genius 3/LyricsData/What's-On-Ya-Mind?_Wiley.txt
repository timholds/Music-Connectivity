[Verse 1]
We done what we came to do, leave the legacy
I can't lie I feel drained, but my heart still looks for energy
It gets carried away, hyped up like back in the day
I take note of fans, I like seeing them having their say
When it's all said and done
We got to work for daughters and sons
That's a job for parents
But I know it might feel awkward for some
Bringing up children, there ain't a manual
You gotta face the stuff you can't handle
Same way you gotta show love and do the stuff you can do
I realize too many rules might block the creative system
I got a message for my people worldwide
Because I'm relating with them
If you're going to take something from me, take the wisdom
Use that, get the fire in your heart
Make sure you change the system
It's all good anyway because I know the youth's future is bright
A place where the world's multicultural
That's the future of life
Believe these issues that we make issues won't be their issues
I tell them, "Please try and value the time that humans misuse"
On the real, though
Face challenges
Understand lawyers, managers
Understand the point of business
Learn, rise above amateurs
Because if you don't, you're gonna be pointing [?] road to road
Street to street, Ave to Ave
