I think..I think I see where you're goin' with this one E

Hey, hey, been around the world and back, yeah I did that
Still kick raps in cars and packs, so where's my kids at?
And everybody hatin' sounded funnier than Sinbad
I'm ill as the pills that they give you when you collapse
This, that, the other, kiss your mother with that mouth?
We the kids that she warned you about
We just storm in your house open doors through a cloud
Got an assortment of styles, just be sure that it's wild
6:30 in the mornin' and there still ain't signs of slowin' down
Twin sisters gettin' wasted so they both are down
It's goin' down, I thought I told you mane
If you tryna to party let me see you raise your hand

There's a party on 5th ave (a party on 5th ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like 20
I'mma hump it and come runnin', cause we gotta hit the road
Make you sure you gotta
Clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
We're just about there you choose
We're at the party on 5th ave tonight
And that's what I'm tryna do

Hey, what's the difference between me and you?
When no one believe in you, I'm flyer than beetle juice
"DJ Enuff", But still I might eat your food
I party and sleep til noon, what every day people do
Give me a week or two
See when you read the news my bitch
My rhyme time is why, my album is fly
Your favorite record, you gonna put it aside
This that old school shit soundin' good in the ride
And I'm only countin' to nine
Said this that old school shit, soundin' good in the ride
Said let's head out to the party I'll drive

There's a party on 5th ave (a party on 5th ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like 20
I'mma hump it and come runnin', cause we gotta hit the road
Make you sure you got a
Clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
We're just about there you choose
We're at the party on 5th ave tonight
And that's what I'm tryna do

What's goin' on? There's a party
Hope the neighbors don't mind us gettin' loud
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right
We came to get down, we gonna do that now

My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on
My light up shoes on
They love the way my kicks flash
This ain't a time to just sit back
Cause, there's a party on 5th ave

There's a party on 5th ave (a party on 5th ave)
Hit me if you tryna go (hit me if you tryna go)
I can be there in like 20
I'mma hump it and come runnin', cause we gotta hit the road
Make you sure you gotta
Clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes
We're just about there you choose
We're at the party on 5th ave tonight
And that's what I'm tryna do
