Wayward son, where are you heading?
Your fire burns, soon it will be setting
Wounded like a plane with one wing
Darling, to kiss your affliction on the sea
You spun a wheel and laid it all on a wager
Then your fist, are you walking papers?
Now smile, please, upon your lips
And I'll lay something that you can't resist
You're on your own, without a moment's rest
While your heart pounds against your chest
In the twilight you wait to hear the whispering of the waves
Washed up like a castaway
Washed up like a castaway
Dismal day, tumbles like a clown
Just in time to peel yourself from the ground
Like a snake, you can slip from your skin
Oh, to blow from town to town like a gipsy or a whim
Golden boy, where is your Midas touch?
For everything around you has turned to dust
Now you're live in fear of the hand
Would you come and turn it all on your palaces?
You're on your own, without a moment's rest
While your heart pounds against your chest
In the twilight you wait to hear the whispering of the waves
Washed up like a castaway
Washed up like a castaway
