[Verse 1: PHZ-Sicks]
Let me make love to you with my words
Let them hold torches in your mind so they can go and observe
All your desires and being to ignite that fire
Out of this world just a ceiling, we can go higher, higher
Higher, higher, to another level, another echelon
Let the neighbors know what type of shit we on
Love that could create peace, using my sex as my weapon
Shooting down all your doubts
Knew that you would come by word of mouth
You’re the beauty that lives in the back of my mind
Lift thighs as your eyes roll in the back of your mind
It’s like

[Hook: Scolla]
We can make love in the morning
Sexing in the evening
Freaking on the floor just
So you know the feeling
Take it to the countertop and up against the wall
I just hope that you can take it all once you get me in the zone
In the zone, zone, got me in the zone (Yeah)
In the zone, zone, got me in the zone
In the zone, zone got me in the zone
Yeah, in the zone, zone, got me in the zone, yeah, yeah

[Bridge: PHZ-Sicks & Alison Carney]
[PHZ]
Breathe
Just lay back and put your faith in me
Stopping gripping the sheets and put your nails in me
See I’m quick learner so tell me what you want from me
What you from me?
[AC]
Baby, can you make a scene?
Can you give me what I need?
Just come real close to me
With that cosmic energy
Got me breathing heavy
[PHZ]
Breathing heavy
[AC]
Yeah
[PHZ]
Holding sready
[AC]
Holding steady
[PHZ]
I’ve been waiting for this for a long time
Are you ready?
[AC]
Yeah

[Verse 2: PHZ-Sicks]
Hold you from behind with my hand on your neck
Shit, stop fucking around, just undress
Just wanna see you take it off
Put your panties in a ball, let them off
To the floor, this a precursor to what’s in store
Like I kiss you down your whole body or
I can get to the point and assist you to score
For the feeling that you came for
From the feelings that you came from
The circle of life, shit, I’m nice
No inhibitions here, baby , practice your vice
She lives the poetry she cannot write
So let’s put the words into action tonight
Who said love couldn’t be rough?
Blackout into dusk, give you live in the morning while I’m waking you up

[Hook]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3: Alison Carney]
Gripping the sheets, I ride the beat
I promise you that I keep it going, you promise that you keep it real deep
You’ve got nothing to hide when you’re inside
I let it all go with you and even swallow my pride
So, let them all keep staring cause I don’t even care and
We can do it anywhere
Tell me you can handle that
Making you sweat
Cause baby, you’re making me wet
And I know it don’t get no better than this
A bite, a kiss, and then all this
Tell me what you gonna do with it
I might let you decide
Boy, if you can make me fly
Can you take me to the sky
I, I, I
We can make
