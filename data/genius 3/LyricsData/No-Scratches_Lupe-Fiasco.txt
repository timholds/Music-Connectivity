[Intro]
It’s for the love
Cause we love you so much
Keep it real
I don’t feel what you feel though
You don’t feel what I feel so
It all started out

[Verse 1]
See first I had patience
And a nigga had energy
But now I'm weak, definitely
Pedi to the pedal, you finna speed
You remind me of... of my Jeep
But off in the future, and what it’s finna be
All your memories can become enemies
So let’s intercede I know you in the seat
But let’s get outta that, before it’s injuries

[Hook 1: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
At first I had patience
But then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin’ turned to wasting my time, my time, my time
And then that wasting turned to hating
And then that hating got to racing
All around my mind, my mind, my mind

[Hook 2: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak and it crashes
Just walk away no scratches
(No scratches)

(See first they had patience)

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
But niggas start getting sick, niggas start getting ill
Niggas got cold feet, niggas start getting chills
Niggas start staying home cause niggas start getting bills
Building up an immunity
Niggas stopped getting hurt
Niggas relied on faith
Hopin’ niggas get healed, its hopeless nigga, get real
But ah, get back on the pill
We in it for the feel
But even winners can earn sinner patience

[Hook 3: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
But then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin’ turned to wasting your time, your time, your time
And then that wasting turned to hating
And then that hating got to racing
All inside your mind, your mind, your mind

[Hook 2]
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak and it crashes
Just walk away no scratches
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak and it crashes
Just walk away no scratches
(No scratches)

(First we had patience)

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Mini-Bar raided, in the indy car faded
500 miles, it’s pretty far ain't it?
But it’s a pretty car, ain't it?
Pretty hard painted
But pretty darn dangerous
But we ain't get the memo, hangin’ out the window
They don’t care no more
Trynna take this Mini to a Limo
Without a helmet then you can Thelma-it
Louis, Louise but we on the same thing
So I be James Dean
So your wreck and my wreck look like the same scene

[Hook 2]
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak and it crashes
Just walk away no scratches

(No scratches)
(First we had patience)
