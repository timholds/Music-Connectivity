[Chorus:]
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
You've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
Think you've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone

[Verse: Kelly]
Take her to the movies
Dinner all the time
Shopping sprees for her
On me, you never spent a dime
But I was there for you
When you had nothing at all
Then, you got a little job and
She's the one you call
And now

[Chorus:]
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
You've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
Think you've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone

[Verse: Beyoncé]
Oh, now you're taking me for granted
But you only get one chance
Then, you left me hurting
And it won't happen again, no, no
So she finally left you
It ain't no surprise
That you missed your water
Cause your well went dry, oh
Now that's she's gone, babe

[Chorus:]
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
You've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
Think you've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone

[Bridge:]
Understand, I understand
Why you think I want you back
After what you did to me
Did you think you blinded me?
Boy, you know whatever you do
It will all come back on you
Cause you tried to play me like a fool
Understand, I understand
Why you think I want you back
After what you did to me
Did you think you blinded me?
Boy, you know whatever you do
It will all come back on you
Cause you tried to play me like a fool

[Breakdown: Beyoncé]
Now that she's gone
You, crawlin' back
Got it like that
You made me wait too long
Oh, I'm gone
Now that she's gone
She's gone
Come back, oh
You made me wait too long
Too long, too long, too long, too long
I'm gone

[Chorus:]
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
You've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
Think you've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone
Now that she's gone
You wanna come back
Is that a fact?
Think you've got it like that?
You made me wait too long
I'm gone
