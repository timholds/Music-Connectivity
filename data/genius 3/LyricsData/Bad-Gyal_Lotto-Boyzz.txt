[Intro: Ash]
AYD, are you dumb boy?

[Chorus: Ash]
Baby girl you're bad
I love it when you misbehave on me
Have you got a man? Or nah?
If you don't you can play with me
One time for dem bad gyal
Bumper go boom, boom, boom, boom
Wanna know why I'm preeing so hard
I showed her the keys to my car
Cos she said she wan' a man, soldier
She don't want a van, she wan' Landrover
Babe I got the plan, you could come over?
My way, my way, come closer
We could take a trip showing you the culture?
Sitting on the sands, sippin' on a soda

[Post-Chorus: Ash]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's my bae
That's my bae
Yeah, that's my bae

[Verse 1: Lucas and Ash]
It's like just the other day, had to follow her on the gram
10 minutes later she luckily followed back
Liked couple pictures of mine, got double-taps
I was feeling it, I swear down I gotta holla dat
So I crept up in the DM, like I'm the one she's feeling
All up in her feelings and I ain't even beat it
I ain't sayin' nuttin', we can keep this one a secret
Hold me down like the deepest
We've been talking so frequent
Like, bad gyal, I call her Riri
Anytime she wan fi see me, you know I'm easy
Call me daddy, wan fi please me and she nah tease me
Back it up for your boy, call me Lotto Lukie
Told me she had a man
Don't really think that she cares
Snapchat, calling me daddy with pictures in underwear
Now she calling my phone in studio, so I air
I'm tryna chase this money, wanna be a millionaire

[Chorus: Ash]
Baby girl you're bad
I love it when you misbehave on me
Have you got a man? Or nah?
If you don't you can play with me
One time for dem bad gyal
Bumper go boom, boom, boom, boom
Wanna know why I'm preeing so hard
I showed her the keys to my car
Cos she said she wan' a man, soldier
She don't want a van, she wan' Landrover
Babe I got the plan, you could come over?
My way, my way, come closer
We could take a trip showing you the culture?
Sitting on the sands, sippin' on a soda

[Post-Chorus: Ash]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That's my bae
That's my bae
Yeah, that's my bae

[Verse 2: Ash]
See I know my shawty from the way
Back sending me cray
Yay, yay, yay crazy
Phone me, I'll be on my way
Me and these niggas we ain't the same
Yay, yay, yay, yay
Oh there's too many drinks it's a mad ting, ah yeah
You don't wanna get involved, yeah
Come on you can see this love, yeah
Baby gimme peace, no war yeah

[Bridge: Ash]
You remind me of a girl
That I, once knew
I see her face, whenever I
I look at you
But wait, yeah
Girl I pray you're not a paigon
It started with a conversation
And I will deal with your frustration
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah

[Chorus: Ash]
Baby girl you're bad
I love it when you misbehave on me
Have you got a man? Or nah?
If you don't you can play with me
One time for dem bad gyal
Bumper go boom, boom, boom, boom
Wanna know why I'm preeing so hard
I showed her the keys to my car
