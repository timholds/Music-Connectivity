[Verse 1]
Don't know how I'm gonna get it
I'm so in love with an angel girl
How I'm gonna get it
She makes me fall in love with the, with the world
And everybody knows it
Everyday that I ever was
They know!
Everybody know by the...
And everybody knows it
Nothing is for searching
Everybody knows it
Nothing is for certain
In this life time or the next one

[Chorus]
Give me all you're loving
Give me all you're ...
Give me all the things that you did not know that you got me
So give me all you're loving
Give me all you're...
Give me all the things that you did not know that you got me

[Verse 2]
I wanna live with an angel woman
I wanna love her!
Cause there is nothing after...
There is nothing after...
Everybody knows the deal
Everybody knows the deal
Everybody knows it

[Chorus]
Give me all you're loving
Give me all you're ...
Give me all the things that you did not know that you got me
So give me all you're loving
Give me all you're...
Give me all the things that you did not know that you got me
