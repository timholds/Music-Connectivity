I got troubles that I can't hide
So many and it's turning on the inside out
I know a woman's nature
There's nothing you can save in me
I run every time

We got two tickets, but they're one way
And I went with it so I can't say no
I lit a fuse I can't stop
I opened doors I can't lock
But still I never meant to be this close
And let it slip away
I keep stumbling till I finally miss the last train Oh...
She's ready, I'm not ready
I hear people go crazy for steady
But me, I run every time

So I told her "get a head start"
Like the last one, I didn't have the heart to tell her straight
I know how she'll receive it
And I can't bear to see it

That's why I never meant to be this close
And let it slip away
I keep stumbling till I finally miss the last train Oh...
She's ready, I'm not ready
I hear people go crazy for steady
But me, I run every time
And I hope
She sees
It's not her
It's just me
And I'm so...
Sorry
To be this close
And let is slip away
I keep stumbling till I finally miss the last train Oh...
She's ready, I'm not ready
I hear people go crazy for steady
But me, I run every time I'm close
And let it slip away
I keep draggin' my feet till I finally miss the last train Oh...
She's ready, I'm not ready
I hear people go crazy for steady
But me, I run every time
I run every time
I run every time
I'm...close
