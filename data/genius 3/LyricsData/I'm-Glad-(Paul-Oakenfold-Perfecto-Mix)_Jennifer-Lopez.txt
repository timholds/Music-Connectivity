I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
Baby, when I think about the day
The day that we first met
I wasn't lookin for what I found but I found you
And I'm bound to find happiness in being around you
I'm glad when I'm makin love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind every time
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
You know, I dig the way you get down
And you still know how to hold me
A perfect blend and masculine
And I think I'm in love
I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind every time
I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
I love it 'cause you seem to blow my mind every time
I'm glad that you turned out to be
That certain someone special
Who makes this life worth living
I'm glad you're here just loving me
So say that you won't leave
Baby, since the day you came I've been glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad
I'm glad when I'm makin' love to you
I'm glad for the way you make me feel
