A black sun has risen
Look up into the sky
Enter your rain season
Drown out the light
A return to the soil
Harvest by hand
Depleted and bleak in
An unfertile land

Is it fate or is it fortune
That blasts our past to oblivion
Can you feel
The weight has shifted
Drought decay have
All been scripted

As I lay beneath
It's piercing rays
Unlearning and burning

Drown all light into the shade of night

A black hole has engulfed us
Pulled apart at the seams
We drift through the void
We struggle to see
Trapped in an infinite
Reversal of life
Shelter yourself in the
Shade of the night

Is it fate or is it fortune
That blasts our past to oblivion
Can you feel
The weight has shifted
Drought decay have
All been scripted

As I lay beneath
It's piercing rays
Unlearning and burning

Swooning doom and rebirth
A vision obscured
Ecliptical and shadowless

Black clouds are looming off
In the distance
Another great victory for
The resistance
Awake to greet the new
Dawn though the mist
The day it all changed and
The black sun eclipsed

Drown all light into the shade of the night

And lying beneath it's rays
All that we have created will be erased
