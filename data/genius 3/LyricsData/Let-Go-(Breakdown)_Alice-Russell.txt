Gotta get my mind clear
Got nothing to lose
Gotta get my pink stray
Jazz away them blues

Still got my fake
But it's gettin loud
Now all these voices
Keep spinning round

Still above my skate
But a place in mind
He's closing me in
Such words that grind

I'm familiar Jenny
Missed them signs
I bare my positions
Flip over time

I'm trying not to break down
I'm holding on too tight now
Let go
Let go
I'm holding on too tight now
B r e a k d o w n
B r e a k d o w n

I'll breakdown
All eyes on me
I see you right
Right inside of me

Tell my back I'll be back too
'Cause there's not much to lose
I'll beep my past
Still my blood beats blue

I'm trying not to break down
I'm holding on too tight now
Let go
Let go
I'm holding on too tight now
B R E A K D O W N (breakdown)
B R E A K D O W N (breakdown) (holding on too tight now)
