Without You

[Verse 1: Jon Corbin]
I’m stuck on a seesaw - back and forth
Bouncing off the walls like a racquet sport
Fighting vice like Macklemore
Refusing to trust what you have in store
You adopted me into sonship
I just wanna run when your son slips
Enticed by a poisonous tongue drip
Lies ‘til unworthy of love I’m convinced
But there isn’t one sin that your son missed
Of Your love I wanna be convinced
Stability is difficult to find
Seeking God Is a new way to grind
I don't know who you think Jon tries to be
Deep inside I'm wrestling with anxiety
I'm tired of this loneliness, kind of blue
My heart cries out, “Let me find You!”
It's true, I can't do this without you

[Hook: Relic]
Without You - I don’t know where I’d be
Without You - my blind eyes couldn’t see
Without You - I’d have nowhere to go
Without You - I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know

[Verse 2: Eternia]
I been a zombie for days
All the things I said and did is a haze
I know I’m lost without you, God, now I'm caught in a maze
Amazing grace
I test it every time I lose faith
Chasing after my own ways
To my desires I cave
Saving face
Praying like I'm in the right place - and yet I'm not
Fooling family and I turn from your face
I got a lot [of] grim stories, how you brought me thru safe - and yet I drop
Right back, didn't learn from mistakes
[And] in myself I'm a coward, not brave
[If] I rely on my strength I am destined to be enslaved
You say: “Abide in me, brokenhearted, weeping and plagued
I will renew your strength, you will run and not faint”
Without You I could see the end of my days
Clear as day
Weeping in the web that I made
Oh weak heart, have faith, He is faithful to save
And that's the truth
Shed my skin
I'm lost in my sin without you

[Hook: Relic]
Without You - I don’t know where I’d be
Without You - my blind eyes couldn’t see
Without You - I’d have nowhere to go
Without You - I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know

[Verse 3: ILL Seer]
My mind strays to the time I tried to walk away;
What with all the self-reliant talk today
Had my health, so defiant push the dock away
Jumped the son-ship for one hip and rocking. Hey
I was younger, see Hunger’s like a Mocking Jay;
End of Game what I brung rot - decays
Then again, when I sung your praise, I could hip-hop for days
Dismayed, why’d I press stop - delay?
Guess I thought I’d impress with what I got displayed
But whom I bluffing? I got nothing, if it’s not your grace
I mean, I could not even respirate
Please, why’d I ever test my fate?
When I press in, I feel blessed and great
When I caress hate I feel depressed and grey
So I need you
I can’t proceed … Without You
