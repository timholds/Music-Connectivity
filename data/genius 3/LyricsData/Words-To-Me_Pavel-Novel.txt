What's the true measure and worth of a man?
No credit if you weren't present at the birth of his plan
Pledged to the pleasure, treasure is never given
But ripped and taken from the seams, awaken from the dreams, be driven
Believe in your power to reap your own seeds
Fulfill your needs and desires
Empires built higher and never considering the fall
Still minds stuck in a never-ending stall
And the ever-standing walls built by you
Limited the view and perception killed by two sides of the same coin
Witnessing pride and shame join
Praise and blame joined at the hip
Lies and truth coming from the same lip
Tongue twisting while wishful thinking
That the relationship isn't sinking
Asking how much more can the spirit, feelings, and heart take
So you set yourself up for failure and heart break
And the daily fights take up weeks, and it starts to take
Years of tears streaming, fears and demons teeming, seeming sick
Dreaming you weren't weak
Maybe a little stronger, asked for another chance, a little longer
The devil dance to angels song or
Humming, strings strumming
And heart beats drumming to its own tune
Too soon you fear, and nights dragging the moon near
And the ruin is obvious and I'm in this
Going nuts like almonds is,
Ominous crow craning its crooked neck
Symbols simply here, and sympathizing is fear of being alone
Sitting at home, out of the zone
Prone to start bouts of a memory
Wondering about if you remember me
Saying you'll never do better since you met her
You can't forget her despite empowering rhetoric
Until it makes you sick
Apparent that the fear is a tattered pattern
Flawed karma flowing happening
Harming future harmony and happiness
