[Verse 1]
Through the snow we're chasing
So fast my heart's racing
Flying down mountains so tall

They all try to keep up
While we fuck this shit up
So fast try not to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Won't you ride with me?
Far away from the day
Break from the nighttime too
(Turn off the lights Let's go!)

[Chorus]
All I want to do
Is run away
Jump on my board
And just spend time with you

And in my heart
Don't think I want to celebrate without you here
With me

And can you see it
That I'm falling through the snow without you here?

I thought I'd never be alone
Until you went away

[Bridge]
They all try to keep up
While we fuck this shit up
They all try to keep up

They all try to keep up
While we fuck this shit up

(spoken)
Boy, you know I'm gonna treat you right
You're melting the ice around my heart
Hit me faster than a snowball
