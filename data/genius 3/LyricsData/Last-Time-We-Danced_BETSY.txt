[Verse 1]
Take me back to when it was only you and me
Could never be lonely
Every last second I'd give to you
Endless drunken nights together, felt like this could last forever
Every morning I would think of you

[Pre-Chorus]
So I drove all night to be by your side tonight
In my beat up car, following the stars
Drove all night to be by your side tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause last time we danced, we were losing control
Last time we danced, you were touching my soul
Last time we
We were all alone and it felt like home
Last time we danced, your touch was like an addict's drug
And all that I could see was love
You were touching my soul
Last time we danced
We were all alone and it felt like home

[Verse 2]
Time goes by and lights start to flicker
Someone else stands in the mirror
Faces change but I stay here with you
Never ending fights, hungover
Seems like it could all be over
But every morning I still think of you

[Pre-Chorus]
So I drove all night to be by your side tonight
In my beat up car, following the stars
Drove all night to be by your side tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause last time we danced, we were losing control
Last time we danced, you were touching my soul
Last time we
We were all alone and it felt like home
Last time we danced, your touch was like an addict's drug
And all that I could see was love
You were touching my soul
Last time we danced
We were all alone and it felt like home

[Bridge]
Last time we
Last time we danced

[Chorus]
'Cause last time we danced, your touch was like an addict's drug
And all that I could see was love
You were touching my soul
Last time we danced
We were all alone and it felt like home

[Outro]
Last time we
Last time we
