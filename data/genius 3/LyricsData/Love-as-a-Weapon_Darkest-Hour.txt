And with the presence of power
Comes the rebellion of innocence
We're in this all for each other
Lifetime reversal in decline

Commencing countdown the time has come
Battle lines are drawn
Commit the ashes back to the earth
Lifetime no decline or falling back to the end of the line

You've known the secret all along
Never stayed where you belong
A battleground that you adore
A heavy heart in a savage world

This is a war with love as a weapon
When all that you've lived for is gone
Heavily armed stay ready for anything
I don't believe the innocent night or day

I'm at the mercy of all i say

I don't give anything away
I don't give anything away

You've known the secret all along
Never stayed where you belong
A battleground that you adore
A heavy heart in a savage world

And it's a savage world
One that I've never known
Out of the safety of your home

This is a war with love as a weapon
When all that you've lived for is gone
Heavily armed stay ready for anything
I don't believe the innocent night or day

I'm at the mercy of all I say

I don't give anything away
I don't give anything away
