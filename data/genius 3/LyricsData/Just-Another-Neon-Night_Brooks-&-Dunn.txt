[Verse 1]
I'm a cool one down at the end of the day
A little sundown buzz 'n more on the way
I wash a week's worth of dust off my truck
While Bobby Earl runs home to get dressed up
Here comes Clifford... got a forty in a brown bag
In his pointed-toe boots with a hat-man rebel flag
He's got a Eastwood grin an' a tourist swagger
Hollering: "Turn off that rap boys an' bring me some Haggard."

[Chorus]
Getting drunk, getting loud
Billy throws a punch in the crowd
Some cowboys lights go out
Running wild, getting high
Smoking tires through the lights
Living like we're never going to die
It's just another, just another neon night

[Verse 2]
We got Ricky and The Redstreaks playing down the road
Oh, it's All Night Ladies Night at the Cotton-Eyed Joe
JC always gets the girl, Billy's always fighting
Poor old Bobby Earl never gets the right one

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Neon night.[x3]
