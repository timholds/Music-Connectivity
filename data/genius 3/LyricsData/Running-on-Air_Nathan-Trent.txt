[Verse 1]
It's been a long time running, 'cause I had some things to see
I had to meet some people who were there to believe in me
I'm takin' all that struggle, reminds me what I'm fightin' for
I'm livin' it up, I ain't gonna stop, 'til I make that final score

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll keep running as fast as I can
I'll keep running – I won't stop, I won't stop, no, no

[Chorus]
Hey now! If you push me down, I'll get up again
Hey now! If you let me drown, I'll swim like a champion
I'm sure, there'll be good times, there'll be bad times
But I don't care 'cause I'm running on air
Running, running, hey!

[Verse 2]
Give me a million reasons, and my answer stays the same
You can try to put me in a box, but I'm doin' it my own damn way
See, I can't stand them talkers, all pretending that their life's a mess
'Cause whatever you want, whatever you need, you gotta get off your…

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll keep running as fast as I can
I'll keep running – I won't stop, I won't stop

[Chorus]
Hey now! If you push me down, I'll get up again
Hey now! If you let me drown, I'll swim like a champion
I'm sure, there'll be good times, there'll be bad times
But I don't care 'cause I'm running on air

[Bridge]
Hey, I'm running on air!
Running, running on air!
(Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh!) Running, running, now, I don't care

[Chorus]
Hey now! If you push me down, I'll get up again
Hey now, hey now! Yeah! (Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh!)
You can push me, push me down (Oh, oh, oh! Oh, oh, oh!)
Hey now! But I'll get up again!
I'm sure, there'll be good times, there'll be bad times
But I don't care 'cause I'm running on air
