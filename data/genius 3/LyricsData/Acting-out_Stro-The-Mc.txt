[Astro : verse 1]

We just tryna get this dough
Bear with a nigga like a liquor store
Shit’s hard like steel that’s why we stole
G’s never follow but they're told
Advice nice but the chedder way better
For the bread they keep barettas
All them haters they got them heaters
Niggas get lead if they try mislead us
Takin’ them chances cos we wasn’t given
See life is a movie we sinning we livin’
It’s a movie we cinema livin’
Don’t be surprised when the hood is a prison
And niggas is pressin’ them popo is stressin’
We out here with nines if you don’t get the message
Stress up but my stacks is down
Niggas wonder why we acting out

[Hook](x2)
Why the hell you actin’ out?
Whachu you niggas doin?
Trappin’ on dem corner blocks
Wachu niggas doin’?
Bodies droppin’ cameras watchin’
Whachu niggas doin?

[Astro : Verse 2]

I be that G double O
When blood and  loken
Pistol toting, drinkin’ smokin’
Ho’s is hopin’ we approach ‘em
Cos we poppin’ while they thotin’
Bodies droppin’ cameras watchin’
Momma workin, pops in the box and
You better stay away
Before you get you pay away, put your hat on layaway
Pop Pop!
That’s what you hear ‘round here
Be bright like Chris Brown’s hair ‘round here
Pow Pow!
They don’t really care ‘round here
Change for the bus? we get feared ‘round here
Reason is there’s no reasoning
Take from hands who ain't feeding them
And even then you get clapped out
Life’s drama class and we acting out
Rahh!

[Hook]
