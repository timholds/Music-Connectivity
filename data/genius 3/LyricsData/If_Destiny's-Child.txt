[Verse 1: Michelle]
If I don’t pick up the phone like I used to (for you)
Don’t you take it personal

[Kelly]
If I don’t do all the things that I used to do (to you)
I ain’t mad at you

[Beyoncé]
If you get to feeling stressed up in your chest thinking that you about to lose (baby it’s true)
And If you’re losing out on sleep

[Michelle]
Home worrying about me

[Kelly]
That’s how it be

[Chorus: All]
If you don’t know now you know
You’re gonna miss (my love)
And I ain't stressing 'bout a dog gone thing
Cause I was true when I gave you (my love)
If you search you will never find another love like (my love)
You’re gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my (my love)
My love

[Verse 2: Michelle]
If you think I caught a feeling when I heard about that other chick (No)
I already knew about it

[Kelly]
I just needed time just to clear my mind and ask myself
(Why I didn't handle him)

[Beyoncé]
If you woulda taken care of home instead of leaving me alone (I)
Still would be right there with you
Taking care of you
Steady loving you like I used to do

[Chorus]
If you don’t know now you know
You’re gonna miss (my love)
And I ain't stressing 'bout a dog gone thing
Cause I was true when I gave you (my love)
If you search you will never find another love like (my love)
You’re gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my (my love)
My love

[Bridge: All]
There once was a time I blamed myself for what was wrong
(I can see so clearly now because you are gone)
That’s how I spent all my time when you weren't home
(Playing around with them raggedy heifers)
There’ll be no more stressing, no more crying, no more trying
I would rather be alone (I’d rather be all by myself, yeah)
Because this valuable heart of mine was yours until I realized
Finally opened my eyes

[Spoken: Kelly]
You see ladies? I know I knew better
What was I thinking? He gon' miss me when I'm gone

[Chorus: All]
If you don’t know now you know
You’re gonna miss (my love)
And I ain't stressing 'bout a dog gone thing
Cause I was true when I gave you (my love)
If you search you will never find another love like (my love)
You’re gonna miss me
I ain't got time while you sit around and play with my (my love)
My love
