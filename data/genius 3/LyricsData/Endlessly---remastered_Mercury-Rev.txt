Standing in a dream, weaving through the crowded streets, leaving you again, endlessly
The choir disappears and voices in yr head appear, leading you again, endlessly

If the armies of her soul take you by surprise and flee, leaving you again, endlessly
An the darkships of her eyes surrender to you suddenly, leading you again, endlessly

Standing in a street, the line beneath the falling leaves, leading her again, endlessly
And of all the stars above, only one reminds her of, leaving you again, endlessly
