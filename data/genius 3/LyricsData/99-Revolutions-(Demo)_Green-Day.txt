GO!
NINETY NINE!
WOO!

There's trouble in the air
A rumble in the streets
A going out of business sale
And a race to bankruptcy
It's not 1 to 99, It's 99 to 1
A common cause and a call to arms
For the health of our daughters and our sons

It's Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!

There's a rat in the company
A bail out on easy street
How the fuck did the working stiff (WOOOAH)
Become so obsolete?
So hit the lights and bang the drums
And let your flag unfold
Cause history will prove itself
In the halls of justice and lost souls

It's Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!

We live in troubled times
From the ghettos to an empty suburban home
We live in troubled times
And i'm 99% sure that something's wrong
It's all wrong!

It's Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!
Ninety-Nine revolutions tonight!

It's Ninety Nine!


NINE!
NINE!
TO ONE!
TO ONE!
WOW!
