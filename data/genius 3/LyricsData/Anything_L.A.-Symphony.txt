[Verse One]
It's amazing how your love got me pacing
Blood rushing through my veins, my heart racing
Can't take the fact, your love that I'm losing
My silly acts got too confusing
Ready to do anything, I mean anything
Just to get you back by any mean
I'll give you better things with my better ways
Answer my call and let's get away

[Pigeon John]
I'm so sorry that I gotta go
Your hearts in my hand and I can't let it go
And I'm squeezing and I can't pretend to know
What I'm doing but I'm breaking [?] off real slow, okay

[Sareem Poems]
I love and I hate you, it's all the same
I'm joy and I'm pain feel it's all the same
My heart's broken you say I'm to blame
Somebody end my misery, I'm a horse that's lame
It's a crying shame the way that I feel inside
I see you and I think, "die, die"
I wish that somebody would gouge out my eyes
So I wouldn't have to see you kiss another guy

[Hook: Pigeon John]
I'll give you money, buy you wheels
Give you hundred dollar bills and never part only to break your heart
I'll give you anything, anything, anything
I'll give you anything, anything, anything

[Verse Two]
Aw shucks
Speaking of love this will amaze y'all
Lay y'all to sky, sometimes it fades y'all
(Another one fade away, just let me pave the way)
Baby I'll do anything just to brighten up your day
Sometimes it's pleasurable, sometimes it's miserable
Most of the times it's downright critical

[Sareem Poems]
Most of the times I do be feeling you
But right now I'm just not into you

[?]
I hate girls and girls hate me
I love my girl why can't we be free?
I want the kind of love that you see on TV
But that kind of loving won't come to me

[?]
Love me for me and I love you for you
I just have a few switch ups I wanna do
Change your hairdo, perk up your attitude
Six inch pumps to adjust your altitude
Cause you've been lousy, drowsy, possessive, protective
Overly abundantly edgy, defective
It won't work out, I give you everything
You give me nothing and still complain

[Hook]

[Bridge: Will.i.am]
Girl you could have my, money and my time
You could be my everything, oh yeah
You could have my bone, yeah girl
If it was my, I would give you the world
You could have my, space and my place
You could count my, money
But you can't have my...
No you can't have my...

[Hook]

Take me back, take me back
Take me, take me back
Take me, take me back
Again, again
