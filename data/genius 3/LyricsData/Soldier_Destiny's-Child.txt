Hey
(I want a Soldier!)
The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' impala's around
(I got a Soldier!)
Wit the top down feeling the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs ridin' harder than guys
Wit the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them lames be spittin' at you tell 'em don't even try it
To shot it with 'Chelle and kick it with Kelly or holla at B
Ya, gotta be g's you way outta your league
Please!

[Kelly & Destiny's Child]

[Hook: Destiny's Child]
If his status ain't hood
I ain't checking for him
Better be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood
I ain't checking for him
Better be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he better be street

[Beyonce]
We like them boys up top from the BK (BK)

Always riding big on the freeway (freeway)

Next to the speakers keep a toy in the trunk of the 'lac
A reformed D boy use to run into traps
Still a soldier do to war if you running your trap
About my girls ain't no thing to put you under the map
Walk the streets five deep with nothing less than a stack
And 80 carats on my chest provides a special attraction
50 G's in my jeans plus the dough from the waller
It's the reason I'm the king girl, I know what you like

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, see cash money is a army
I'm walking with purple hearts on me
You talking to the sergeant
Body marked up like the subway in Harlem
Call him, Weezy F. baby, please say the baby
If you don't see me on the block I ain't trying to hide
I blend in wit the hood, I'm camouflage
Bandanna tied, so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name she salute!

[Bridge: Beyonce & Destinys Child]
