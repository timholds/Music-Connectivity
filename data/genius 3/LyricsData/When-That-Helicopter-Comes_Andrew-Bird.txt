It's gonna rain champagne and the hills are gonna dance
There will be power in the blood when that helicopter comes
The sky will swim in lightning fire and the trees will shake and scream
Rocks gonna roll up hill and the sun will dive in the sea
The dead gonna wake and sing and roll their bones in the grass
