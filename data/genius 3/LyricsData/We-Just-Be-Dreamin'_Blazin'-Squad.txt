(Chorus:)
Close my eyes an' I'm there again we've got
Girls sweet smoke in the air again We dreamin, We jus' be dreamin
N' now we're livin in the sunshine

(Verse: (Krazy))
Close my eyes and I dream for a minute
The place I had dreamt had us all in it
Hittin girls up two at a time and we'll be livin in the sunshine
This girl was lookin at me
She had long brown hair
About 6 - 3
Girl - you're too tall for me
So baby - go try your luck with Kenzie

Sippin' on gin n juice in the shade
Girls by my side cuz I just got paid
I got a right to blaze it
Bumped by the caseload
Eating strawberries off of her navel

(Chorus x2)

(Verse 2: (Strider))
Let me tell you about a dream of mine
We were all laid back in the sunshine
We dreamin - girls just be screamin
I dont think its my time to leave and
I ain't coming down for days
I'm feeling so good in so many ways
Feeling so crazy - chilling with the beautiful ladies

(Chorus x2:)
(Flava)
Yo - me n the boys are here
What you know about us?
How we roll in the summer
How we blaze bunnin it up
Runnin the beats, sunnin the streets
Winnin the cup luvin the heat
Comin from me- its picking me up

(Rocky B)
It's the holidays
Girls in the park - it's a lovely day
Baby mommas chillin with their friends
Watch their babies play, past summers flash bk
Like they were yesterday,betta dayz
Blud chill blaze the day away

(Freek)
Summertime hot girls theres a lot a lot to play
In these dayz the summer, if ur a buuner its funner
Coz u jus sit there and wonder
Sittin under sun, all the girls and boyz come together as one

(Chorus x5 till end part)
