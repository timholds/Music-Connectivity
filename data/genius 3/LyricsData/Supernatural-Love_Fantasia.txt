[Intro: Fantasia]
The world says that this love is not good for me
But my heart says that it is
I never loved like this before

[Verse 1: Fantasia]
You be like seeing the sun the first time
Like I just did a hard nine
And knowing that the check just cleared
You make my problems disappear, oh
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
And we in the club and the beat just dropped
It's what you do to me

[Verse 2: Fantasia]
And you be reading my mind
And always finish my lines
You take your time, you don't rush me
The clock don't move when you would touch me, oh
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
And we in the club and the beat just dropped
It's what you do to me

[Chorus: Fantasia]
I'm a lady, I'm a woman
I'm a mother, I'm a daughter
But when I'm with you I have powers
Supernatural, the love is ours
Oh, baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
That's what you do to me

[Verse 3: Fantasia]
And you been changing my life
The love like gold, but we shine
It's like you take control of me
The clock don't tick til you would touch me, oh
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
Oh, this love, boy, you too much
And we in the club and the beat just dropped
It's what you do to me

[Chorus: Fantasia]
I'm a lady, I'm a woman
I'm a mother, I'm a daughter
But when I'm with you I have powers
Supernatural, the love is ours
Oh, baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
That's what you do to me

[Verse 4: Big K.R.I.T]
K-R-I-T
I'm down to go to war for this love we got
Fight on the field of light
Fly above all the shots that haters take
Why break formation, we own the path
This shit ain't rocket science
We should just do the math, 1+1
It equals the world and all those things beyond
If it gets harder to breathe, I'll be the air in your lungs
Put my life on the line, I do you right every time
Cause what we got is sublime, when you shine
You like this thug ass lady
But if you ever need shelter from the worries of the world
I'm the one that you should run to, baby
You make me sing a bit
There's powers in our fingertips
There ain't no other love like this
I'll prove it, we do it like knowing all the time shifts
And adjust to our rhythms when undercover
I know you the type of queen I would take to meet my mother
And the type of freak that will get me into trouble

[Chorus: Fantasia]
I'm a lady, I'm a woman
I'm a mother, I'm a daughter
But when I'm with you I have powers
Supernatural, the love is ours
Oh, baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
Baby, this how you make me feel
That's what you do to me
