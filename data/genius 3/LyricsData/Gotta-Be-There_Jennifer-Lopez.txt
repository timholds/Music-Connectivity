[Refrain]
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?

[Verse 1]
I remember I said we should split
Had a lot going on and you weren't part of it
You trying to reason with me I admit, but I did
And now I'm walking around so, so sick
And now I'm fiending, for you that's a fact
Got me missing you like LA misses Shaq
What I got to do
On my mission to get you back
Cause I'm just that whack without you
Oh baby, baby I

[Pre-Chorus]
Really didn't mean it
When I said it, I'll repeat it
I was tripping flipping out It was some nonsense
I was on a whole other level, now I got it all together
I was sick, but now I'm better
I was trying to push you away
Really wanted you to stay
Didn't know that was the case
It was just plain crazy because around here lately
Been thinking about nothing but my baby

[Chorus]
If you're in Houston
Hosted in Atlanta
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Chilling in New York
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico
(Baby, I gotta be there)
If you're in Chicago
Hanging out in the MIA
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Maybe you can be in LA
(Baby, I gotta be there)
I just wanna be your lady
(Baby, I gotta be there)

[Refrain]
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?

[Verse 2]
What's done is done, and I want to take it back
I'm not living in the past, but now I want you back
Got to get you, got to get you here
I been looking for you everywhere
Everywhere, baby
I'll apologize 1000 times to you if I could prove, prove
Baby I'm wrong and out of breath
From bein' around the world trying to get to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Really didn't mean it
When I said it, I'll repeat it
I was tripping flipping out It was some nonsense
I was on a whole other level, now I got it all together
I was sick, but now I'm better
I was trying to push you away
Really wanted you to stay
Didn't know that was the case
It was just plain crazy because around here lately
Been thinking about nothing but my baby

[Chorus]
If you're in Houston
Hosted in Atlanta
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Chilling in New York
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico
(Baby, I gotta be there)
If you're in Chicago
Hanging out in the MIA
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Maybe you can be in LA
(Baby, I gotta be there)
I just wanna be your lady
(Baby, I gotta be there)

[Refrain]
I wanna be where you are
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?
Could it be I stayed away too long, oh?

[Chorus]
If you're in Houston
Hosted in Atlanta
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Chilling in New York
(Baby, I gotta be there)
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico
(Baby, I gotta be there)
If you're in Chicago
Hanging out in the MIA
