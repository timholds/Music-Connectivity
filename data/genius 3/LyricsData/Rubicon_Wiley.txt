I don't pet, I rain on a set
Going so hard I gained the respect
Respect is mutual, the same I expect
When I give it out without the chain on my neck
Give it out without a thought of a plan, though
I'm from a cancel block I get around, though
I make waves that are big out of tyne show
And I do that I'm big out of time bro
No king will ever go untested, it's what he does that might get him arrested
How he handles things that he requested
How he caters without requesting
Anything from anybody you might offer
Said I'm not a don, but they was off their rocker
I'm not a blocker but since I joined twitter get right and I'll block ya
You're a good act of an actor, I laugh
And it hurts like a fradatadatcture (fracture)
You can be the don of this town, that town your city on the riddim I'll cadatadatcha (capture)
I go to the hood and give badacadatcha (back)
Call me a king, that's a fadatadactcha (fact)
I ain't no fiend don't cudatatdatcha
I've got my business into that, to that, to that
I walk in like crew disagrees, I'm my POG for everybody in the scene
Stay ol' free, cause I was poppin with the dream
Now it's a reality bobbin' in a weave
You do grime but stop you when I breave
I go to the gym and I feel like Rocky when I leave
Man feels stocky when I leave
Don't ever sound sloppy on a beat
I'm in free and I'm E one for it east
I could take one E one towards the south for me a bit but east I'm more
If I manage to chat on Twitter the beef's unsure
Ignore that if you wanna elevate higher
Cause we all know God loves a trier
I didn't get here overnight
I spent so many years walking through fire (fire)
You will get pied didn't get far cause you still tried
All your hype died, all your fan's lied
And me I'm just a MC inside the ride
I do it for real, that's why I'm still firing
I could bring a monkey and a lion in
That's who I am, I'm wear my own garms and I do my own ironing
I'm just screening bars like I ain't got a life
Got one fresh ting but I ain't got a wife through danger
Blood, I could trainspot a hype
They flicker in eye, I said the flame's not as bright
Game isn't tight, the aim isn't right
I roll like a comet, I came on a flight
You ain't having it, I'm the same on the mic
So I can't go fast and blame on a mic
Don't touch, you'll burn your hand on a stove
I'm not in Ladbrookes when I say that I'm standing in grove
I can handle my role even though I know I ain't no random approach
My hand grows cold, that's right for it, I'm right for it
Test me, I might set you a light for it
Spray can, I'm ready to spray and
I believe in myself, I'm ready to spray anger
Twenty of the best and now I will put twenty to the test
And I leave all twenty in a mess, pick twenty of the rest
Doing that again, that's forty
Not just twenty of the best, I'm stepping on stones
No bad bones in my body, but I gotta start stepping on clones
Don't forfeit nothing, rip out of zones
Caught one spit and get out your phones
Fire spit fire, you should be alive
Bees buzzing around me a lot, I should be a hive
You hove around me a lot, I can see a vibe
If I hove around you a lot I can see a style
Shit MCs, I can see a pile, but it's better they learn now than try in a while
No time like the  present, I'm present
And grime ain't felt this alive in a while
So have a laugh, stink, have a bath
Feeling like Rozay, then have a glass
I made snowman, ice man know me
Frost bite lyrical man, an avalanche
Cause I don't think my production act that much
But I don't think that I can't
Open the logic, tage [?] I make one
That instinct can rid him that I know another can't, blood
Run up in your place like what then
Then it could be mic stars cause my manaman already got them
Too many bullet in the pen, I gotta stop them
Take pics I don't like and I crop them
Too cure in a game, so
If I come across another artist, I can't knock them
If I see a kid who don't know jack shit
Tell him put down the knife and I block them on pop them on
I only work for legs and arms
I said I've been a bit lucky like charms
Them man are cool they never had arms
Might have chromes but never had a heart
Never had a finish, never had a start
I ain't come along like: what the rass
None of these spitters in my class
I was making noise even since I swing
Let me put it on now, let me see what I think
Quite cool like the colour blue
Same colour as the drink I drink
Don't wait for the day I sink
Cause more than often I'm out of sync
Some are hanging on, ain't heard new stuff
I know you don't work, I'm out of blinks
Pumped out chick chilling on a red
Just like the yellow M on the Maplyeys' sign
Nigga might be late but then it's black peeps time
Might be hated but I catch these rhymes
See, I know a young belly, you will come for the belly
And take the whole belly like that's his types
See me in a carnival, that's me type
Got test passing more and that's revise
And I might despise of any of them guys
Who don't wanna work  nights but that's his life
Might call Danny Phillips, see what's gwan'
Shots of jaeger bombs Black Keith life
Realage, Woolwich, back to queen's life
Skunk [?] sticky like the inside of a bee hive
I'm the cop, the man for the job
Kind of seems odd, but the fans decide
Phone Z dot get 'em riddim kill it with a headshot
Some man have gotta hear lie like escort
Man are looking for a wave on a Friday night
When I'm free wanna see you what the west got
Don't test me, I put a hole in your best top
I'm a young gun ain't lettin' off the test shop
Ain't the best and your best not get in my way
Cause I'm top and your sex not
That's why you dub play stop before they hear me
