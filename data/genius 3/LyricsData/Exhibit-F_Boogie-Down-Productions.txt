[KRS-One]
When you realize you have this army, or one concept, one thought, one
Movement, one action; you have what is called a revolution. But the
More we stay seperated, and the more we don't understand the concept of
The EYE, that is within all of us, then we will constantly constantly
Lose, every single battle, from day one to day forever. Thank you
We'll take questions. *clapping, applause, and shouting*
