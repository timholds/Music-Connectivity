[Verse 1: Rivers Cuomo]
What's with these homies dissin' my girl?
Why do they gotta front?
What did we ever do to these guys
That made them so violent?

[Pre-Chorus : Matt Sharp, Rivers Cuomo]
Woo-hoo, but you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo-hoo, and that's for all time

[Chorus: Cuomo]
Woo-ee-ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that

[Verse 2: Cuomo]
Don't you ever fear, I'm always near
I know that you need help
Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit
You need a guardian

[Pre-Chorus: Sharp, Cuomo]
Woo-hoo, and you know I'm yours
Woo-hoo, and I know you're mine
Woo-hoo, and that's for all time

[Chorus: Cuomo]
Woo-ee-ooh, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that

[Bridge: Cuomo and Sharp]
Bang! Bang!
Knock on the door
Another big bang, get down on the floor
Oh no! What do we do?
Don't look now but I lost my shoe
I can't run and I can't kick
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' sick?
What's a matter, what's a matter, what's a matter you?
What's a matter, babe, are you feelin' blue? Oh-oh!
(And that's for all time
And that's for all time)

[Chorus: Cuomo]
Woo-ee-oo, I look just like Buddy Holly
Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore
I don't care what they say about us anyway
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
I don't care 'bout that
