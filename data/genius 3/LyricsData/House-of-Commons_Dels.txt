[Verse 1: Dels]
Early morning yawning, feeling dormant, standing beside myself
I’m drunk as hell, slurring words, gnihtemos that semyhr itwh lleh
I don’t know either...? Not even making sense
Somebody pull the lever, I’m at tether's end
A stressful week exits through the pores what’s the cause?
I can’t disclose that
That might start a war and draw some claws
My boys are arguing like politicians
This house of common folk is full of endless contradiction

[Hook: Dels]
Some are coming up, some are coming down
A few are sitting on the ceiling, pass that bag around
I’m falling deeper in a coma
My clothes have been dipped in a greenery aroma
And I don’t even smoke man, the truth is getting closer, sinking in the sofa

[Verse 2: Dels]
A boxer caught a hook, delayed jubilation
We’ve have the box on mute, We can’t compute these things we’re facing
You’ve got something on your nose?
He said it’s product placement
Then he rolled his eyes as I declined to cross the line of Satan
That’s a journey I ain’t taking...
Make a statement about how my rhymes would benefit if I’m high, sky scraping
I’m fine with this bourbon, ginger-chaser
I’m sinking in the sofa, game over, cue the fader

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Dels]
There’s a certain stillness to this place
Times moving slowly, at a Turtle pace
And my face is sliding off my head
But I’m not dead, metaphorical
I’m just lean, I’ve just seen my Grandmother
She says she misses me...
