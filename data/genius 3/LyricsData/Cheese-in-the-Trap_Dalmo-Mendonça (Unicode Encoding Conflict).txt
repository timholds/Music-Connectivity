[Hook]
Cheeses ain’t cheap, and that ain’t saying nothing
A hundred little mice wanna take my hundreds
I got cheese in the trap, yeah, cheese in trap
Cheese in the trap, cheese, cheese in the trap
Cheeses ain’t cheap, and that ain’t saying nothing
A hundred little mice wanna take my hundreds
I got cheese in the trap, yeah, cheese in trap
Cheese in the trap, cheese, cheese in the trap

[Verse 1]
I’m sorry if this is sour, this is not my steeze
But sit back and listen while I stack my cheese
I put it in the oven so it flows a little better
I give it back to you, and you hand me a lot of cheddar
This girl is macking me, and there’s nothing I can tell her
She’s only after me ‘cause I got that mozzarella
She tells me I’m the one, I’m the one that she should marry
But I stay away from her cause her eyes are on my dairy
This talk of cheese makes me hungry, and now we’re a little meta
I’ll open up my wallet-fridge and take out all my feta
Homegirl finally left me, said my cheese game is whack
After I gave her a slice of my Monterey Jack
I can’t live too expensive, I don’t wanna spoil the party
But I can’t pay my bills with my literal havarti
Don’t worry, I’m happy with the dough that I make
I mixed up metaphors, now I’m making cheesecake
