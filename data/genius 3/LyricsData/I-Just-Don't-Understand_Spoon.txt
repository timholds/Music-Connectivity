Well, you call me your baby when you're holding my hand
But the way that you hurt me, I just don't understand
Well, you say that you need me like an ocean needs sand
But the way you mistreat me, I just don't understand
Well you know that I love you more than anyone can
But a one-sided love I just don't understand

(Hmmm hmmm ah ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

Well you know that I love you more than anyone can
But a one-sided love I just don't understand
Well you call me your baby and you're holding my hand
Oh honey, you hurt me and you don't understand
You just don't understand, you just don't understand
You just don't, don't, don't, don't, don't
Hmmm hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm hmmm, hmmm hmmm hmmm
