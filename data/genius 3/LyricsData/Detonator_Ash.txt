High explosive girl you turn me on
So volatile like a walking atom bomb (just like a walking atom bomb)
Just takes one spark to kerosene
You go off like nitro-glycerine (you go off like nitro glycerine)

The supernatural cannot wait
I'll show you how to detonate, yeah

I'm coming up, I'm rising from the flames
I've been born with fire in my veins (I've been born with fire in my veins)

The time is right to deviate
The supernatural cannot wait
I'll show you how to detonate
Yeah!
