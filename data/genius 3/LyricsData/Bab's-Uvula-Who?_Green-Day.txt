[Verse 1]
I've got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high
I lose control and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts and I fly off the wall
I self-destruct and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation set in
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up

[Chorus]
I lose myself and I'm all wound up
Petulance and I'm all wound up
Loss of control and I'm all wound up
I lose myself and I'm all wound up

[Verse 2]
Chip on my shoulder and a leech on my back
Stuck in a rut and I get myself all wound up
Killed my composure and itâ€™ll never come back
Loss of control and I get myself all wound up
Blown out of proportion again
My temper snaps and I get myself all wound up
Spontaneous combustion, panic attack
I slipped a gear and I get myself all wound up

[Chorus]
I lose myself and I'm all wound up
Well, I am fed up and I'm all wound up
I lose myself and I'm all wound up
I like myself and I'm all wound up
Yeah!

[Verse 3]
I've got a knack for fucking everything up
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up
My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high
I lose control and I get myself all wound up
Tension mounts and I fly off the wall
I'm on the run and I get myself all wound up
Petulance and irritation set in
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up

[Chorus]
I lose myself and I'm all wound up
Loss of control and I'm all wound up
Panic attack and I'm all wound up
I lose myself and I'm all wound up
Shuh!
