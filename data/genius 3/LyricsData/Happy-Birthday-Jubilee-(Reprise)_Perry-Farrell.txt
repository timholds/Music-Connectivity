We're coming from far and wide
We're singing a song to you
Gather us together
For cake and candle light
The red heifer is here
And cousins of twelve tribes
Count up all our faces
Divide up the cake in pieces

We've all come here to see
Happy birthday Jubilee

It's your bith, It's your birthday party
It's your birthday, It's your birthday party
It's your bith, It's your birthday party

Now this is how it is
This is how we "B"
This is how we all
Gather around the queen
Buzzing in the hive wagging from the tree
Promised with the milk
Is the honey
Miss us when we go
So goes the pollen
So goes the fruit
And no more flowers
"B" is the bet
"B's" make houses
Busy, busy "B's"
And "B"-day announcements

It's your brith, It's your birthday party
Your birth, It's your birthday party
Your birthday, party
Your birthday, party
Your birthday, party
Birthday, party
Your birth, your birthday, party
It's your brith, your birthday party
It's your brithday, It's your birthday party
It's your brith, your birthday party
