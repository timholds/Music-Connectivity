In a spiral, a comet on the blood-red horizon
Falling headlong, in flames I tumble into the ocean
In a fever, it's never gonna let you forget her
Come whatever, and who are you to know any better?

On a wave, never gonna see her again
On a wave, gonna ride it right to the end

A tsunami, slamming on floor of the ocean
An emotion, a butterfly has put it in motion

On a wave, never gonna see her again
On a wave, got it right right to the end
On a wave, breaking away
On a wave, don't care what you're saying

She always swore that
We'd make it whatever
Through any tempest
We'd stick together
She's in my system
She'll stay there forever
Like a virus that's in my heart

On a wave
On a wave

At night I'm floating on the seabed
White horses, charging over my head
And all is destined to decay
All is programmed to betray
In your heart and soul enslaved
Brake away on an ocean wave

Devotion, I'm falling to the floor of the ocean
I'm a depth of charge
A fireball of love and emotion

Yeah
On a wave, never gonna see her again
On a wave, got it right right to the end
On a wave, breaking away
On a wave

Don't care what you say
I'm leaving today
I'm breaking away on a wave
