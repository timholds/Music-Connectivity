Dear Lord, this is a prayer, just let me know if you're really there
Dear Lord, come gain control, oh Lord, come save my soul
Give me dignity, restore my sanity, oh Lord, come rescue me
Dear Lord, my vanity, oh Lord, it's killin' me, it's killin' me

If you give your soul to Heaven and your soul begins to bleed
Remember all the sevens, don't turn up when you need
If you do believe in glory then please believe a fact
Give your soul to heaven you won't get it back

I'm down deep and I need your help
There's no one to turn to and I can't help myself
Dear Lord, hear this call, oh Lord, save my fall
I'm scared, I doubt, dear Lord help me out
I despair, my Lord, oh settle here

Dear Lord, take the time, I believed your story now you believe mine
Oh Lord, I'm on my knees, oh Lord, please, please beware
My Lord, oh care, my Lord give me dignity
Restore my sanity, my vanity is killin' me

If you give your soul to Heaven and your soul begins to bleed
Remember all the sevens, don't turn up when you need
If you do believe in glory then please believe a fact
Give your soul to heaven you won't get it back
