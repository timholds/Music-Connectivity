Have you ever been lost didn't want your direction
That was your intention
Are you free can't you see all the things that surround you
Let them astound you...
Let yourself believe in mystery
When you find yourself in another galaxy
Go beyond the limits of sanity expand your mind
Secret hideaways are awaiting you
And if you challenge all the fears that won't allow you to
Intimidate yourself with something new...
Take a look around and see beyond the things you can't imagine
Use more than just your eyes senses can hypnotize
Take a look around and go beyond the limits
If you haven't, let go and breathe it in
Let the record spin...
When in France don't just dance
Sit back relax and enjoy your favorite flavor souffle
Have you tasted your life lately
It looks like it could use a little more gravy...

DJ won't you play that song for me...
