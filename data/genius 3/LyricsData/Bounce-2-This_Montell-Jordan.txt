Montell's in the house
Oh, hey, yeah

Another Friday night
Another honey sitting in my ride
Another lyrical flava from your 6'8" neighbor
Make ya wave your hands from side to side

In '95 we did it
But this year I bring a new twist
They say I'm here to announce this song called the bounce
So everybody bounce to this

(So right) It's so right (So nice)
Tell you I'll make you wanna bounce to this
(Yeah, bounce to this, bounce to this)
It's so right (So right)
And so nice (So nice)
I tell you I'll make you wanna bounce to this
(Yeah, bounce to this, bounce to this)

Montell started bouncin' on ghetto neighborhood blocks
You see I'm vocally silent and that keeps my wallet so fat
I have to stuff my socks
My 'hood keeps getting bigger 'cause phat def jams I bring
And now the world is bouncin' while I do my thing

I've been to parties across the USA
I've been to other countries
And I've made those people say
Bartender, ooh my cup is runnin' low
So pass the Alize and let the music play
And act like you know

It's so right (So right)
It's so right (So nice)
And I'll make you wanna bounce to this
(Yeah, bounce to this, bounce to this)
It's alright (So right)
Kadance sing it (So nice)
I tell you I'll make you wanna bounce to this
(Yeah, bounce to this, bounce to this)

It's alright (So right)
It's so nice (So nice)
And I'll make you wanna bounce to this
(Yeah, bounce to this, bounce to this)
It's alright (So right)
It's so nice (So nice)

(Yeah, bounce to this, bounce to this)
