References to the sun
Tonight, I'mma fight till we see the sunlight
We're delirious, tear it down, 'til the sun comes, back around
And now the sun is rising, and now the long walk back home
And the sun is comin' up, and oh my God I think I'm still drunk
Drunk off of nothing but each other 'til the sun rise
Oh oh oh, we're falling in love! Oh oh oh, till the sun's coming up!
Electric wire love, the sun was coming up
