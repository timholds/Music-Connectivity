[Verse 1]
When your headlights cut across my wall
Yeah, I thought it might be you
Looking for a place to fall
An' talking sweet, an' thinking small
Seeking out convenient arms
Yeah, to rest in for a while
Someone to keep you safe an' warm
While you ride out your latest storm

[Chorus]
Oh, my heart's not a hotel you can check in an' out of
It's not a, a temporary shelter, it's a home for someone's love
Don't just come here when you're lonely knowing, full well, you won't stay
Because I don't have the strength tonight to turn you away

[Verse 2]
Oh, don't let the dawn find me asleep
On a pillow of regret
Take all my change, just leave the key
An' let me keep my dignity

[Chorus]

[Outro]
No don't just come here when you're lonely knowing
Full well, you won't stay
Because I don't have the strength tonight to turn you away
I don't have the strength tonight to turn you away
