You lived what you believed, you swore that it won't stream
You sacrificed your life for me, did what you had to do...
No man was there to see,the journey that you made
A thousand miles across the sand, just to find a better way!
There a some(some), who may never be seen
By the world, for the things they do!
We are kings fighting wars from the seas to the shores
Then an unsung hero comes..
You've always been with me, through battles lost and won
A soul just standing to the end, so do all of you've done
So as I see the world, we're looking through your eyes
Silently you've made a difference, changed so many lives!
There a some(some), who may never be seen
By the world, for the things they do!
We are kings fighting wars from the seas to the shores
Then an unsung hero comes...
And it doesn't matter if you fail, or evan if you fall
The fame or star can lead the way, theres a hero in us all!
There a some(some), who may never be seen
By the world, for the things they do!
We are kings fighting wars from the seas to the shores
Then an unsung hero comes
We are kings fighting wars from the seas to the shores
Then an unsung hero comes...
Ohhh ohhh oooooh ummm ummm ummm
Hero comes!!!
