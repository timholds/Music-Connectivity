[Iriscience]:
We make good on bomb threats
Bandanas wrapped around our face and neck
Bearded in camouflage like we're Vietnam vets
From the Lakers to the Pistons, Rakaa is on deck
Lions, Tigers, Dodgers and Angels the best wins
Buffalo ain't the only place known for Red Wings
They brawl over the ice and even the ref swings
I ain't talkin' just hockey, L.A. is just Kings
I mix yams with Cali kush and twist
I spit crack, check out how I cook the fix
What side, what block, what hood you with?
It's Caltroit, I just had to push the mix
You know Dilated, we blaze ? with plenty heat
Expansion Team sound, we moves and many eat
J. Dilla forever, that's truth with any beat
Like the tat on Hex Murda's arm, Proof infinity

[Evidence]:
I pay tax better act like you know me
L.A. still shootin' back at Axel Foley
I ain't Victor Maitland and this ain't Beverly Hills
It's Black Milk and Bishop, that's the homie
Dilated and my dawg Diverse
What a perfect word, watch out, here go the Evidence
This ain't a perfect world, we still gettin' it
And I'm still keepin' it church and ain't weaponless
Underground with a platinum resume
The best to not blow, the world ain't heard of me yet
Some call him a vet and some never called him back
But he's a legend like Nino in New Jack
Word to Motor City
My co-worker's gonna co-sign with me till takin' the globe
The world is mine, arms on the top my ?
Built in the floor shit, got a matchin' robe
Oh!
