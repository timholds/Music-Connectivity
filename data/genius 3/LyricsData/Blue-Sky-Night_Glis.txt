I have been reborn
A never ending storm
Inside the sleep of reason

Oh I have been reborn
There's an electric storm
Inside my dreams
Awaken me

(Am I gonna break or am I gonna make it)

Complacent
I don't know how
Illusion's web
Is coming down
Coming down

I have realized
That I've been flying blind
Flying blind
Under that blue
Oh that blue sky night

I was tranquilized
And believed the lies
All those lies
Under that blue
Oh that blue sky night

Complacent
I don't know how
Illusion's web
Is coming down coming down

(Am I gonna break or am I gonna make it)

I've regained my sight
And I am taking flight
Taking flight
Under that blue
Oh that blue sky night

I've transmogrified
My water into wine
Into wine
Under that blue
Oh that blue sky night

Transcendent
The time is now
Illusion's web
Is coming down
Coming down
