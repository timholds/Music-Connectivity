(Choclair)

Aiyo wassup
Yo it's me
Yo wassup
The Choclair brother represents the T-dot
The O-dot
Chiznock rocks it non-stop
So come and take a ride on the parinormal side

(Afrolistic)

Aiyo wassup
Yo it's me

Come and take a ride on the paranormal side

(K.C. Thomas)

Aiyo wassup
Yo it's me
Yo wassup
K.C. Thomas represents the T-dot
The O-dot
K.C. rock the block
Come and take a ride on the paranormal side

(Afrolistic)

Yo catch the feeling of the sub-human being
Forever seeing things you can't see
Cause I was born intraverdly
Cutting wind with my lyrics like the sword of Shinobi
Was on the down low (but now people' bout to know me)
The signifigance of this is get you bliss and keep you hungry
My style never duplicated it metaphores constently
While other brothers be actin real phony I be wettin' ladies with my
Punchlines
Beggin for me tony

(Choclair)

Now you never seen this brother comin' from the Eastbound (Eastbound)
To coin a phrase and have the shhh locked down (locked down)
To throw a show an clock the reds and the browns
Clown people get clowned and jack-fakers beat down
I rock it from the borough break down to Doomstown
And milk some ----- out in 'Saga city
And laughin' with my cousins up in Brampton
Stylin' profilin' while East York calls down the fort
Peace to Julie Black who lives out in North York
Yo these people try be dissin' me I ask 'em what for
You got no credentials or potential to step into the realm of the sexual

(K.C. Thomas)

Now first things first
K-c-t h-o the m-a-s
Bring it to your face brother or to your chest
I'm nice times twice I use this mic as a lyrical sacrafice
Got you in my grips like vice
I represent the T-dot
And I'm known to keep a hot spot
Flows like blood clots
Know my abc's and what-nots
From a to z including p's and q's
And if you's rhyme alarming your's is on snooze
I'm addiciting like booze
Like Parker Lewis can't lose
Your lacking a smacking
My rhymes are known for beat-jacking
And brain-cells for packing persona
Full of lady-macking
Stop acting like you're shifty
Jack be nimble K.C. be nifty
This lyrical hit can dis the
And make a grown woman miss me
Come on now I see why you actin' kinda sissy

(Choclair)

Ha ha ha I laugh when I kick ass
Sometimes I wear my contacts sometimes I wear my glass
Now don't be confused 'cause of my body mask
And tone dark skin body shape slim fast
Sit down and wonder how a brother like I
Can stick out and penetrate like I'm between two thighs
People gettin' hog-tied
They riled up
Droppin' more shhh than stars
Paranormal big (ahhhhh)
Smiling on people think they rule like Castro
They run around the board but they never pass go
Choclair the ill flow sexual chiznock
That represents the T-dot

(K.C. Thomas)

Now this be the fifth verse different from the first
Leave you ice cold like a body in a hurse
I likes writin' hip-hop
Use me innovate your thirst
I'm bright like the sun with the flavor ready to burst
I run with two in this rap game
Three including moi
Mabye three joining a freaky setion
Menage-a-tois
This bomb shock heavy loading explosion
K.C. quiet but causin' up comotion
Smooth like lotion
Imagine hot baby oil where you want it (right here baby)
How you want it (right there baby)
You know you like being spoiled
Temperature risin' and now you're folding up like foil
Next week
The same place the same time the same staton
The same climax of elevation
Baby

(Afrolistic)

Yeah check out my stats
I throw more bombs than quarterbacks
Never surronding myself with fictional description
Only facts freestyle on a daily is my aerobics
No impaired vision clear focus
Stretch my lady's limbs like if she was warmin' up for gymnastics
I leave you adolescent like pee in your bed matress
I'm way beyond the year of '96
You still stuck in '86
Stick to your tricks and porno flicks
Bruise the knicks and leave with my goal of makin' my scriputes aincent
Like startin' a fire with two wooden sticks

(K.C. Thomas)
It's like cocky style 1-2-3
We got what it takes
Chiz, Afro and me
We roll by the trio east coast
All the way past Peurto Rico
We smooth it out like my vedos
What up taqino
To bubble this track like splimate bambino
You know what I mean-o
Yo check this
My style moves non-chelant sometimes reckless
Gleamish eyes from the jetta to the lexus
May God bless this
Ya know I mean
(whoomp there it is)
Like Tag Team
We keep it tight like the firm got plans like A-Team
No black van we'd rather cruise by in a triple-beam
One day for now we chill and pave the way
We pickin' up ??? of baileys and alazhay
Memories that make me happy
Yeah reminisce like Mary J
It's all that real love in my blood
That keep my lyrics tight like my butt and my nuts
Brother what
I'm all eternal like your guts
And that shhh that's caught up in your butts
What up

(Afrolistic)
Oh let me get my groove on now
Ill scripts and heiroglyphs is my motto
Burn the word tommorrow
Watch the way I catch wreck
On my plantation paranormal illa sub human-being's what you're facing
Mentally blazin'
With my squadron
As we take turns givin' mc's thrid degree burns
Anybody who is a decipticon will be laid down by this autobot
With a peiricing verbal shot
Now who I be is someone who you can't see
Rockin' with my paranorms and f-o-s we be the circle
Bangin' kootchie walls so hard it be turnin' purple
My moves so caseful balerina style graceful

(Choclair)

Forget the nonsense it's all about shocks
I makin' movements with verbal interacton with people who pop the cool
Shhh
Chiznock sexual who breaks it down
Got some ladies that'll go downtown so fellas hush it
Always sayin' how you wanna bus' it
Talkin'
But when it comes time you're skywalkin' now listen
You better start with --- kissin'
Cause when it comes time for confrontation you'll be beggin'
Intermission
I gotta moby dick in my ward now I'm fishin'
Yo people claim they hard rocks but never stop ------
They either hate it or then ya love it
Some girls say they don't do it
Huh shut up and ---- it
You need to understand Ill B breaks it's down as un-deux-trois baby

(Afrolistic)

The O-dot
Afro rocks it non-stop
Come and take a ride on the paranormal side

(K.C. Thomas)
