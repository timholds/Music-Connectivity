[Verse One:]
Stab wounds in the center of a red shape
Couldn’t protect it or fix it, not even red tape
Could make a difference
Even with something different, I listen, but I’m only hearing what’s missing

I understand it, yes, I mean it, I get it
But it’s holding me closely; I’m unable to forget it
Sometimes I wish it was possible:
Ties my thoughts to a chain and then pull, let go, and release
And find peace

[Chorus:]
Mentally all black
I can’t let go, I want to take it all back
Where did I go wrong, the flirting and all that
I wanna let go, and take it all back

I’d take it all back (x2)

[Verse Two:]
I don’t know what the fuck I’ve been doing
My self-esteem has been ruined, my heart is broken in two
And now I’ll never say that I do
I’m a mess, and I know it
Not ashamed to admit it
Many tell me that I’m at blame, and I won’t be acquitted
What’s the reason of my existence
It doesn’t seem to be fair
I open a door at distance, and run into a despair
My soft spot? That isn’t safe. Things never go unharmed
I break whatever I touch, and nothing’s safe within these arms

Broken is much more than a feeling, it’s what I’ve become
But, if I could go back, I’d take it all away
