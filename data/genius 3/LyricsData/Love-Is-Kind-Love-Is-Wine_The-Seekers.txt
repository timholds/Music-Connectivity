Love is kind love is wine
So much laughter in your eyes
And you know that I will love you
Till the last flower dies

Do you hear music far away?
There's so much I'd like to say
Got a felling oh so new
So I'm singing just for you

You are everywhere I find in my heart and on my mind
Time is all I have time for you

You are all that I will be
You're a sunrise on the sea
You're the love I cannot hide
You're a magic carpet ride

You are everywhere I find in my heart and on my mind
Time is all I have time for you
Love is kind love is wine
So much laughter in your eyes
And you know that I will love you
Till the last flower dies
Till the last flower dies
Till the last flower dies
