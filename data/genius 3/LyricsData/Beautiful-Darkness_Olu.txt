[Verse 1: Olu]
Okay if love is so great
Then tell my why it always ends up in heartbreak?
Show me once case where somebody didn't lose it
The heart's worst enemy no matter how you use it

[Verse 2: Olu]
It loses pieces of it, everytime its broken
The first cut always leaves you the most swollen
Cause if it didn't kill it, it just got stronger
And every love after that lasts a litte longer

[Verse 3: Olu]
But beware because you can't retrieve the lost pieces
You can't heal a wounded heart. Lost love's thesis
So take care and treat it better than your most dear
Cause who you gonna share it with when your not there?

[Verse 4: Olu]
Life's not fair. We're expected to survive
We live, love, let life live just to die
Maybe we're just meant to do this:
Recieve life to give life and give love to lose it

[Verse 5: Olu]
Its like we're playin hide and seek with the devil
We seek out the sin and run away from our troubles
The world is in between the fine line of good and bad
And because of this a piece of peace is what its never had

[Verse 6: Olu]
Its in our nature as humans to crack under pressure
Cause while the world is breaking down, our faults make us better
Sometimes its best to do the unthinkable
It takes a few mistakes just to make us unbreakable

[Verse 7:Olu]
No ones perfect, but thats what makes it possible
To be perfect for each other
The sun and the moon, always living in apartness
But together we're just beautiful darkness

[Verse 8: Olu]
You're like the sun, all you ever do is shine
And everytime I'm with you, we eclipse
Blocking out my thoughts, I can't think but I love it
I think I've found what I wanted

Love..â™¥
