[Verse 1: Wiley]
I go back to my old estate
Show love to the whole estate
I roll out on my roller skates
The last 18 months, all the shows were great
I've got a talent, I will never let it go to waste
I rep the whole of London, I know the place
Lay low, I don't really wanna hold a case
When you're top flight, everybody knows your face
Well, I'm Wiley, can't pie me
I'm a weirdo, but label me grimy, please
From '07, '08 times
I was in a Prestige black B
Had a spaceship key, now my basic P
Is a fee that I never saw coming like a bee
I'm buzzing on the tree, smoke weed till my lungs say no
Couple hours go by, then I'm crushing up more weed
PFC, Sam's and Morley's
And a red pea soup if I ever feel poorly
Junior's and Casablanca
Man came from nothing to a cash money banker
No prank and I'm calling direct
BBK is the team that I rep
And I've got my money where my mouth is
I keep talking, no two ways about it
I'm about it, I've got a work ethic
Don't worry 'bout radio, I'm working it
This ain't normal chicken, there's jerk in it
You can find a diamond if you search for it
I work with it, Miley Cyrus twerks with it
Put me in a song and I'm murking it
Came from the dirt with it
When I'm in the club, I circle it
I'm first with it

[Hook: Wiley]
This is my bloodtype, bloodtype
Know people who are angry, people who are calm but that's what my blood's like
This is my bloodtype, bloodtype
Know people who are angry, people who are calm but that's what my blood's like
This is my bloodtype, this is my bloodtype
This is my bloodtype, yeah, this is my bloodtype
This is my bloodtype, this is my bloodtype
Know people who are angry, people who are calm but that's what my blood's like

[Verse 2: Wrigz]
I'm listening, G, but the question is will I believe
Until I've been around these niggas to see?
Sometimes you can tell, don't listen to me
And so far I pretty much did it for free
Realest, listen to the speeches
Been like this from I didn't listen to my teachers
Look, I ain't in awe and the industry's
Full of non-believers, cheaters and leeches
From a city where they drool over heaters
It's hard to explain what the rule of the street is
You've just gotta know, you apply for a job
Was expecting a yes, he just got a no
Phoned up his bredrin, just got an O
For seventeen eighths 'cause he doesn't even smoke
Got one already but he must get a phone
Likkle Â£20 ting and he's good for the road
Sorry, gotta say no today
Gotta think of my hoes today
You're never gonna make no mistakes
So let yourself go
Money works for me, I've got dough to pay
I'm wavy, she knows the way
But no one could own me, sit wondering lonely
Theat she hope I'll change
Mind for the fast on the motorway
Why are we cautious? No one's safe
How we gonna do this? There's loads of ways
But there ain't any that ain't involving pain
Don't stop till the problem solved or changed
Do you do it for the fame or the culture's sake?
What's your bloodtype?
Do you do it for the fame or the culture's sake?

[Hook: Wiley]
This is my bloodtype, bloodtype
Know people who are angry, people who are calm but that's what my blood's like
This is my bloodtype, bloodtype
Know people who are angry, people who are calm but that's what my blood's like
This is my bloodtype, this is my bloodtype
This is my bloodtype, yeah, this is my bloodtype
This is my bloodtype, this is my bloodtype
Know people who are angry, people who are calm but that's what my blood's like
