[Verse 1]
Woke up next to the King
Got up, gonna fix me something
And it made me sick
How I can't trust him, no I can't trust him
Said the bottom of his belly
That's where he would keep me

[Chorus 1]
Christ Jesus
As I'm floating
And you get a brick
And you drop it down on me
Christ Jesus
Have you seen us
Down on our hands and our knees
And tell us what's the reason

[Verse 2]
Like a hawk that's hung in the sky
A hard-on when I die
And you passed away
And that horizon never came, no it never came
It's the time of the week
No one sees but me

[Chorus 2]
Christ Jesus
As I'm drowning
And I struggle to breathe
It's your face I don't see
Christ Jesus
Please don't leave us
If in peace you'll keep us
Well then you should have believed us

[Verse 4]
Please let me inside
And hear out my desire
'Cause soon I may die
Yes one day I will die
I'll get eaten by the rust
You cremate and breathe the dust
And I'll weaken your lungs
And I'll bite off your tongue

[Chorus 3]
Christ Jesus
Please don't leave us
Down on our hands and our knees
Or I'll never believe, no
Christ Jesus
As I'm drowning
And I struggle to breathe
It's your face I don't see

[Outro]
Christ Jesus
