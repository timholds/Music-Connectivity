[Verse]
Well say-a-a-hey, could you come through
Did you feel good, well it felt good
And it looked like maybe you could settle in
Did you think that was dead?
Did you feel good, well it felt good
And it looked like maybe you could settle in
And say-a-a-hey, did you get tired
Did you feel the, all of the compression, did you look off around
So in

[Bridge]
Did you feel good, well it felt good
And it looked like maybe you could settle in

[Outro]
Quick with the terrain
Quick at the terrain
Quick with the terrain
