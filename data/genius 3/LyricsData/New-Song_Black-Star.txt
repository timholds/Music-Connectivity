I have got no reason
I have got no reason at all
Getting older but not getting any wiser
And i never even heard the last call
I have got no reason
No reason have i got
Seems like i am stuck in my old ways
Bitter jaded and vitriolic
Yeah i have got the lot

Got no reason
I have got no reason at all
Got no reason
At all
At all
At all
No reason at all

I got a new song to sing now
Wishing to christ that i would never get old
Whilst to the sands of time my mind and body were being sold
Yeah i have got a new song to sing now
Got no time for getting the blues
After all it could be worse
I could be like you

Well i got no reason
Seems like i lost the plot
Well i am putting it all on the line now
Out on a limb on one final shot
