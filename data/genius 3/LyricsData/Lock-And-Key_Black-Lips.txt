Oh lady when you come messin around
When I was young I felt like a stage hound

Mud on my boots blood on my hand
Blood start drippin on the Ku Klux Klan
Blood on my jeans blood in the land
Blood start seepin in my Budweiser can

I'm dazin when you come messin around
Life was fun when you weren't the talk of the town

I'm crazy when you come messin around
I made it when you come messin around

Mud on my boots blood on my hand
Blood start drippin on the Ku Klux Klan
Blood on my jeans blood in the land
Blood start seepin in my Budweiser can

I'm elated when you come messin around
When I want something from the lost and found
I'm dated when you come messin around
When I'm shunned and you stop makin a sound
