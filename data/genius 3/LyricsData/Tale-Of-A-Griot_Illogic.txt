Time is but a position on a circular piece of mechanic architecture
It's running out So grab your pen and pad so I can start to lecture
Have you read the chapters assigned? Made for you to expand your mind
Refined a voice of fine wine, Collected from a bleeding vine
Overflowing with, All-knowing gifts
Designed to stretch imagination
I have in me the ignition key
Gentlemen start your patience
Guarding patrons of the sidewalk junkies
Eradicate immediately, Those who haven't faced their fate expediently
A demon in me
Tries to escape through written pages
Rippin' stages to shreds bringin' base to heads
Unlockin cages with thread
Now that's a task with a difficulty rating of
Five
Expectin myself to survive
Has always been in the purpose of my rhyme
I've always wanted to be Considered one of the dopest in my field
And it'll happen, If we're not rappin
I'll focus when I build
A lot of kids In the industry already fell off
They just don't know it yet
So until they get the gall to face reality They won't know regret
I have no regrets, That on the track of life I kept steppin
Coverin up the pain From the lessons I could only learn from Gretchen
Thinkin green, Thinking up scenes of life to wallow in
Hopin' I'm dope enough My footsteps someone will want to follow in
I swallow in depth, Chewable artists That wanted to spark this match
Stop heatin me, Before my eggs of thought start to hatch
A heart attack is commin, Smarter raps are runnin rampant
And you, catchin them Is like havin a table with no legs and tryin to stand it

Your defense was down, So just I walked in
Yet your still talk-ing, You need to live
For you I've given all that I can give
Take this rib and be merry
Be a woman if you wanna Cause your actin feminine
Dissin' society that your blendin in. x2

To be perfectly honest would be impossible because I'm human
Only half-truths and partial realities can leap from my tongue
The saliva soaked chunk of flesh that I posses is the key to life rumors
Divine state which activates the piercing poison of its venom Exists in all who breathe
Those waitin' to exhale might suffocate
The un-life's in a bag Just take a bite And gag on your fate
That's why I wait for news to break
So I grab the screwdrivers and vice-grips
So you get the picture, I can plant 35 millimeters in each eye-lid
And every, blink is a snap shot
For secession I hide under that rock
Life's an investment
If you invest in bad stock Shouldn't be shocked when it drops
But it seems, Sense isn't common anymore, Only few hold it
Others don't think,They just gotta deliver next tech Before they load it
And spit blanks Thinking they spittin shells
I'm mendin' heaven and rippin' hell
In life's scenes, I'm chasin' dreams While ya'll chase your tails
I'll tell a vision, With improvision, Improvisin', Intro time Accelerate
What you half baked, Go fishin in Thought's Lake
I thought, Faith was in the Christian
But I see faith is in the man With no legs
Claimin' to stand steadfast and straight up on god's land
I saw the plans For your mansion in paradise
You already got your cake Started to eat it too And can't even share a slice?
I said it twice, and I'll, say it a third
I'm better with words
Twist and bend fractions, Make brain curves, And blend actions
With reality backdrops, With camouflage slap-shots
Stop props from actin, Like you know yourself

Shed the noteless flesh your borne
To disguise your imperfections
Replicate thoughts that hibernate
To hatch in all perceptions
What you hear is what you percieve
Take it in stride and continue to be
As a sheet of loose leaf in a hurricane: Free. X2

Unfortunately life isn't equipped with white out and correctional tape
Instead it come with lies to hide truth, tryin' to correct fate
Let your mind inhale And intake lakes of thought project-tile
And if you wanna talk ish, At least perfect bowl
Movements and motions
As I build with the pen
I'm tryin to stagnate destiny And simultaneously rush adrenaline
Since existence is ambiguous you may take what you can And leave what you will
In other words Take a stand and leave what you killed
And if its an old self then become new, Become you, Become truth
Personify dicodemy and become two
Come on, play your part Cause time's a stage And life's the play
Theres no need to lock the cage now Since the beast already escaped
So grab the tranquilizers
Hunt it down and get it tame
Then according to them, You need to find a style and get a name
That's the only way to success According to big brother and company
To surpass that I'm expectin' Alien entities to come for me
To relieve stress I reflect how my heart rests In the hands of an African angel
Pain
Strangled in five days in a week From misery Deliver me
Find purpose Cause a man with out purpose is worthless
Next time, Try to keep an open mind When common sense freely disperses
Concentrate
My voice inoculates You wait for the serum
Purified venom spit, When you emit oxymoronic symptoms
You are what you've become When you blend with righteousness
While writtin' this the crosshair is one your consciousness
It's up to you if I hit or miss

I use the canvas of time
To paint lifelines
And create masterpieces
So while the brick layer rests
I continue to build on my thesis
They say perfection is only achieved in death
And my words must not exist
I exist and I am words
So I must be verbally flawless. x2

Shed the noteless flesh your borne
To disguise your imperfections
Replicate thoughts that hibernate
To hatch in all perceptions
What you hear is what you percieve
Take it in stride and continue to be
As a sheet of loose leaf in a hurricane

Your defense was down
So just I walked in
Yet your still talk-ing
You need to live
For you I've given
All that I can give
Take this rib and be merry
Be a woman if you wanna
Cause your actin feminine
Dissin' society that your blendin in
