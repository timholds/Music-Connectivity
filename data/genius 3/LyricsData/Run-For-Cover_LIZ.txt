[Interview: Britney Spears & Interviewer]
What do you want your fans to know about you?
Um I don't know, it's just that
I, I, you know just
I do what i do
I have fun with what I do and hopefully I can inspire them in some way
I think you're doing that
(Britney laughs)

[Verse 1]
All the love-sick givers and the takers
All the wounded hearts and all the fakers
All they do is think about the one that got away
I stay in a daydream if you say you're awake

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey...
Put me on the cover of all of your papers, papers
I'm takin a pull and i'm leavin the vapors, vapors
I'm comin for ya
There's no one to save ya, save ya
It's on, it's on, it's on

[Chorus]
Better run for cover
Better run for cover, oh
Better run for cover
Better run for cover, oh
Before the fears get you

[Verse 2]
I say rest in peace to bein patient
I just wrote my victim resignation
You won't see my white flag on the battle field again
I want my fight for freedom
They won't lock me up again

[Pre-Chorus]
Hey...
Put me on the cover of all of your papers, papers
I'm takin a pull and i'm leavin the vapors, vapors
I'm comin for ya
There's no one to save ya, save ya
You know, you know, you know

[Chorus]
Better run for cover
Better run for cover, oh
Better run for cover
Better run for cover, oh
Before the fears get you

[Pre-Chorus]
Put me on the cover of all of your papers, papers
I'm takin a pull and i'm leavin the vapors, vapors
I'm comin for ya
There's no one to save ya, save ya
It's on, it's on, it's on

[Chorus]
Better run for cover
Better run for cover, oh
Better run for cover
Better run for cover, oh
Hey!
