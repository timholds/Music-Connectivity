Baby it's all just like jimi but jimi would leave you a sad song
If you can hear me then tell jimi jimi would give me a sad song

Ain't no life
Have you ever been experienced?
Well i have
I know when it's time for me to die
When it's time for me to die
So let me live my life the way i want to

We're all brothers
Yeah i'm stone free
To random peace
Stone free
I've got a manic depression
I used to live with a real cruel girl
If all the hippies would cut off their hair
I don't give a fuck

Send me a sad song for jimi jimi would leave you a sad song
And if you see jimi then tell him sincerely i'd leave jimi building

So move over rover
And let jimi take over
If you look to the right you'll see a flying zeppelin
He'll jump out the middle
Just let the reels have a talk
If six was nine
Jimi where've you gone?
Yeah i guess i'll put it back on my well wall
