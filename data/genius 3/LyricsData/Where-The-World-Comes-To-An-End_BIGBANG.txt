You ask me if I know what I'm doing
But I don't
I'm looking at my smiling friend
Putting up a front
Lying all the time
I just can't stop
Am I gonna see you
Get back on top

A cool little white thing
Is in your hand
A cool little silly thing
I can't understand

It's everywhere
It's even in your knees
And it's no shame
It happens to a lot of us
And you're not to blame
Things just got too quiet
And you couldn't hide
You got an offer
You caught the ride

A cool little white thing
Is in your blood
A cool little silly thing
Starts to flood
And when your heart is no longer in charge

You go somewhere by the sea
Find a new philosophy
Where the world comes to an end
You're gonna find another friend

Don't you know you're gonna find a way
Out of here
You're gonna ditch those friends
You might as well
You're gonna lose that religion
That makes you pay
Three times a day

You go somewhere by the sea
You find a new philosophy
Where the world comes to an end
You're gonna find another friend
