Don't say I have drinking problems
Don't say I need a real home
Maybe I'm in love and I feel alright
I tricked myself so good
That I passed the lie detector test
When I told her I was unusually bright
Go on take my
My darkest heart
I really don't mind
It's your favourite part
I know what you've heard
Yeah I know what you've heard
But I never lied to save myself
I'm a poet of apathy
I do not ever risk a damn thing
Only the small chance I could die of fright
I joined the mile high club
All by myself but it don't count
Cause I'm left handed and I used my right
Go on take my
My darkest heart
I really don't mind
It's your favourite part
Oh Na Na Na Na Na
I know what you've heard
Yeah I know what you've heard
But I never lied to save myself
Darling if I had some control
Over all of these judgments
I probably would have stayed at home tonight
Cause we don't need to see the spotlight
And we don't need to live the high life
ANd we don't need to see the spotlight
And we don't need to live the high life
Angel you've got a devil in you
And you know that I said I cannot stay here for more than one day
