I was made to move mountains
I was born to be astounding
I was grown with a good heart
The type to dive in the waters and deal with the sharks
Whoever survivded it yo we threw em on the arch
No i ain't noah and no i ain't jesus
Just a man that grew up 2 brothers in the go up
A single mother, but knowing his thank yous and his pleases
Dont mistake my niceness for weakness
Thats thinking you can touch niitroclycerine
One touch freeze, dont feel it shiverin
Yah ice cold then the ground starts tremblin

Chorus
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
(nah nah nah nah)
I was made to move mountains x2
I was born to move mountains

The shoulders brushed off the jeans clean
I rocker her to sleep with no ginsing
Then hoped in the car with the rims that gleam
And im like damn im the man thats how im feelin
And when you feel that way your more appealing
Cause______is king and doubts concealing
And when your concealed yo your hiding your appeal
And when you hide your appeal your lower then equal
You use your pride as your shield
And sometimes pride can be achilles heal
So learn from mistakes and bandage up your heal
Then yah dive first and grab whats real

Chorus
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
(nah nah nah nah)

I was made to move mountains x2
I was born to move mountains

Now please
When you feel that pressure going to your feet
The type of pressue that gone make you buckle kness
Man you gotta step side, brush off your clothes then look deep inside
And then i look into my kids eyes
And when i look in their eyes all im seeing is pride
And when i look in their eyes the reason why i die
And when i look in their eyes the reason whny i strive
Im moving mountains thirty grand high
Whosever on the cliff will take a thrity grand dive
Untill you in this position won't understand why
But whosever in this position will understand why

Chorus
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
(nah nah nah nah nah nah nah)
I was made to move mountains x2
I was born to move mountains

Everybody watch me nothings gunna stop me
Nothing gunna hold me back
Nothings gunna get in my way, my way, my way, my way
Everybody watch me nothings gunna stop me
Nothing gunna hold me back
Nothings gunna get in my way, my way, my way, my way
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
I was made to move mountains
I was born to move mountains
(nah nah nah nah nah nah nah)
I was made to move mountains x2
I was born to move mountains
