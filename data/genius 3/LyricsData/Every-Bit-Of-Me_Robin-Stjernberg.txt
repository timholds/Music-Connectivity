With every breath and in every song
You keep playing along in every part of me
Life on the road ain't just glitter and gold
Everytime I feel lost You're the ones I need
There's no other way
It's how I make my day and
Something I've gotta do but
In every thought that I'm thinking you are
And I'm fighting this war for all of you to see
With every bit of me
When I'm back will you want what is left of me
Just a shadow of what, what I used to be
I gotta make it somehow
I keep trying with every bit of me
Sometimes I dream 'bout what life would have been
Doing something I don't feel to have you close to me
But now I know why I live on this earth
Been like this since my birth
I'm asking you to see
There's no other way
It's how I make my day and
Something I've gotta do but
With every breath and in every song
You keep playing along in every part of me
With every bit of me
When I'm back will you want what is left of me
Just a shadow of what, what I used to be
I gotta make it somehow
I keep trying with every beat with every bit of me
You might think that I don't need to understand
Yeah you might think that I'm invincible
But there's another part that shows you that I care
With every beat...
When I'm back will you want what is left of me
Just a shadow of what, what I used to be
I gotta make it somehow
I keep trying with every beat
When I'm back will you want what is left of me
Just a shadow of what, what I used to be
I gotta make it somehow
I keep trying with every beat with every bit of me
