[Verse 1]
Still can't seem to figure out what happens in my head
Thought that this is going to kill me
Sick of living with this doubt
This pistol in my hand
I could end it all before the morning
But summer time always gonna come around
I'll be right here for another smile
I won't let my feet off the ground
Try to hold on

[Chorus 1]
Gravity won't let me go
Cause gravity won't let me go
Woah, oh
Cause gravity won't let me go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
The devil always smile when you need a friend
I'm laying on this cloud
It's a long drop back to Earth
Wonder when my happy days will fade away
Don't rain on my parade
If it's only for this moment

[Chorus 2]
So gravity let me go
So can you please let me go?
Let me go, oh
Woah, oh
Will you let me get higher, higher?
I just wanna get higher, higher
Wanna get high
Said I wanna get higher
Said I wanna get higher
Let me get higher
I wanna get high
Said I wanna get higher
Eh, oh, eh, oh, eh, oh
Gravity, can you let me go?
