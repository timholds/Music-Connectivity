[Chorus]
A man this lonely, a man this blue
A man whose world's, been torn in two
Needs somebody, with a heart that's true
A man this lonely, needs a woman like you

[Verse]
Two arms this empty, need someone to hold
A man this lost, needs somewhere to go
When the nights go on forever, and the days do too
A man this lonely, needs a woman like you

[Bridge]
I'd lost hope, I was so far down
Here you come turnin' all that around
I'd come to think of love as a lie
All that's on my mind now, is you by my side

[Chorus]
Oh, a man this lonely (A man this lonely), a man this blue (A man this blue)
A man whose world's, been torn in two
Needs somebody (Needs somebody), with a heart that's true
A man this lonely, needs a woman like you

[Outro]
A man this lonely needs a woman like you
