All those bugs buzzin' â€˜round your head
Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair
And the summertime will make you itch the mosquito bites

The buzz of love is busy buggin' you
Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair
And they're splattered up and down your windshield and the headlights

Well, they bite
Yeah, they bite
But you can tell they're there

Does love buzz because that's what it does?
Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair
And the summertime will make you itch the mosquito bites

Well, they fly in the air as you comb your hair
And they're splattered up and down your windshield and the headlights

Fly in the air, comb your hair
Flies in the air, comb your hair
