[Intro/ Pre-Chorus]
I will never let you go
I will never let you-
I will never let you go

[Strophe 1]
Love hurt me - For better or worse I'll be here
(Cause you're the beauty, a Beauty I'm the beast)
Love hurt me - My heart will engulf yours, my dear
(Cause you're the beauty, a Beauty I'm the beast)
Love hurt me - The walls of temptation grow higher
(Cause you're the beauty, a Beauty I'm the beast)
Love hurt me - We're risking it all for destruction and desire

[Chorus: Chris Harms/ Ulrike Goldmann]
No way out and no way back
A bride in white, a dress so red
No, I will never let you go
Oh, I will never let you
I will never let you go

[Strophe 2]
Love hurt me - A gloss on your lips as you leave
(Cause you're the beauty, a Beauty I'm the beast)
Love hurt me - I'm saving the rest of your blood red sweat for me

[Chorus]

[Bridge: Ulrike Goldmann]
Don't leave your vow unspoken
Now that I step into the night (I will never let you go)
Just take my true love token
Hold me and kiss me goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
