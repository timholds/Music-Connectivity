[Verse 1:]
Everyday nothing seems to change
Everywhere I go I keep seeing the same old things
I can't take it no more
I would leave this town
But I ain't got no where else to go

Wake up in the morning to more bad news
Sometimes I feel like I was born to lose
It's driving me out of my mind

Gonna catch the next train
And move on down the line

[Hook:]
I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in
I'll be ready
I'll be ready when my train pulls in

[Verse 2: Gary Clark Jr.]
Walking down the street you might wanna cross a smiling face
But they'll stab you in the back as soon as you turn, walk away
Oh Lord, it's bringing me down
If things don't change around here
Ain't no use in my hanging 'round

[Hook:]
