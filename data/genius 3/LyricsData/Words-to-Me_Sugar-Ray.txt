Get up! Get up! Get up! (Yeah!)
Get up! Get up! Get up! (Get up!)
She sings these words to me
She sings these words to me

I look at you
And try to do
The best I can
But sometimes
It ain't that easy
If not today, she said
Then tell me when
I think I tried to say I'm sorry
Then she said these words of reverence
Please don't leave me hanging on and on

I see the light in your window
Look at the sky and we can go away

Get up! Get up! Get up!
And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna
Get up! Get up! Get up!
And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna

La la la la la la
She sings these words to me
She sings these words to me

Baby

The summer sun
Is warm and you
Are everywhere
But sometimes
It ain't that easy
I count the days till I see you again
You know I tried and I am sorry
One night can make a difference
Please don't leave me hanging on and on

I see the light in your window
Look at the sky and we can go away

Get up! Get up! Get up!
And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna
Get up! Get up! Get up!
And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna

La la la la la la
She sings these words to me
She sings these words to me

Baby

And I don't mind the waiting
When she sings these words to me

I see the light in your window
Look at the sky and we can go
Look at the sky and we can go
Away

She says these words
La la la la la la
She says these words
Come away with me tonight
She says these words
La la la la la la
She says these words
Come away with me tonight

Get up! Get up! Get up!
And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna
Get up! Get up! Get up! (Yeah!)

Get up! Get up! Get up!
And I'm gonna
Pick you up and take you where I wanna
Get up! Get up! Get up!
(When she sings these words to me)

(Fading) La la la la la la
Come on away with me tonight
La la la la la la
