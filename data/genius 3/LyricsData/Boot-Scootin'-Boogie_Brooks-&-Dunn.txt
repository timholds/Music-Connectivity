[Verse 1]
Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well there's a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin' everynight when the sun goes down
They got whiskey, women, music and smoke
It's where all the country folk go to boot scootin' boogie

I've got a good job, I work hard for my money
When it's quittin' time I hit the door runnin'
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin' boogie

[Chorus]
Yeah, heel, toe, do-si-do come on baby let's go boot scootin'
Cadillac blackjack, baby meet me outback we're gonna boogie
Oh get down, turn around, go to town, boot scootin' boogie

[Verse 2]
The bartender asks me, says son what'll it be
I want a shot of that redhead yonder lookin' at me
The dance floor's hoppin' and it's hotter than the fourth of July
I see outlaws, inlaws, crooks & straights all out makin' it shake
Doin' the boot scootin' boogie

[Chorus]
