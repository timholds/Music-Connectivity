Into you so far the words go
So much clearer than you hear
Into you goes everything I know
No one else knows how I feel

Farther down, I'm desperate for you
Where you never have to know
Farther down, I'm still without a clue
'Til something
Something takes my pain away

Only chance can change my fortune
So I'm not sure why I try
As if I could swim the ocean
As if you could start to fly

Farther down, I'm desperate for you
Where you never have to know
Farther down, I'm still without a clue
'Til something
Something takes my pain away
Something takes my pain away
Something takes my pain away

Farther down, I'm desperate for you
Where you never have to know
Farther down, I'm still without a clue
'Til something
Something takes my pain away
Something takes my pain away
Something takes my pain away
Something takes my pain away
