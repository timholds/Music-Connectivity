[Verse 1]
Everybody talking 'bout dirt roads
Everybody talking like Jethro
Everybody talking 'bout the tall pines
Everybody talking on moonshine
Everybody's saying that "y'all" word
Thinking we're all a little backward
Everybody thinking they can put us in a box of grits

[Bridge]
Well country this

[Chorus]
Well I don't know what you call it but I sure love hauling
Got the jukebox bumping, got the red lights pumping
Got the cowgirls teasing all the boys on the floor
Got their heads all bobbin', everybody wanting more
If you don't like it out here in the boondocks
Give that knob a twist

[Bridge]

[Verse 2]
Everybody talking that slow talk
Nothing but scarecrows and corn stocks
Out here in the city limit backside
Where the necks run a little on the red side
Everybody talking 'bout rhinestones
Everybody's sounding like George Jones
Everybody from the city trying to tell you what country is

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ain't got a hat
Ain't nothing wrong with that
Don't need a pickup truck
Common and crank it up

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Country this
Yeah
