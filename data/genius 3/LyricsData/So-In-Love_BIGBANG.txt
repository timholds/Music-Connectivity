Where the best comes to an end
And meets the worst
I came walking along and I
I came first
What will I do here now I said
I better quench my thirst
I woke up and stood up and said what's up then I
I looked around
I wanted to scream out to everyone
Look what I found
I couldn't even think straight let alone
Make a sound

I was so in love with who I thought you were
I was in the air
I was so in love with who I thought you were
And it wasn't fair

I sat down and thought for awhile then I
I heard a ring
I looked up to see that the white moths were
Were on the wing
Heaven and wood seemed to have
He'd be in the lead
Become one thing
