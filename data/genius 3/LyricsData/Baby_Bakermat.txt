Baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control

My heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control

[Chorus]
Oh, satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out if control

Don't you understand, baby baby please
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
Hey baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Hey baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Oh baby, come and satisfy the need in me
Hey baby

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause only your good loving can set me free
Hey baby, come and satisfy the need in me

[Chorus]
Oh baby, my heart is full of love and desire for you
Now come on down and do what you got to do
You started this fire down in my soul
Now can't you see it's burning out of control
Oh, satisfy the need in me
Oh baby
