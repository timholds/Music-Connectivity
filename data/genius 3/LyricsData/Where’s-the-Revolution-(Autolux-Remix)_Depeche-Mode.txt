[Verse 1]
You've been kept down
You've been pushed 'round
You've been lied to
You've been fed truths
Who's making your decisions?
You or your religion

[Chorus]
Where's the revolu-tion?

[Verse 2]
Your government, your countries
You patriotic junkies
They manipulate and threaten
With terror as a weapon

[Chorus]
Where's the revolution?
Come on
Where's the revolution?
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Where's the revolution?
Where's the revolu-tion?
Where's the revolution?
Where's the revolution?
Where's the revolution?

[Bridge]
Get on board
Get on board
Get on board
Get on board
The train is coming
The train is coming
The train is coming
The train is coming
Get on board
Get on board
Get on board
Get on board
The train is coming
The train is coming
The train is coming
The train is coming
The train is coming
The train is coming
