[Hook: Mara Hruby and (Big K.R.I.T.)]
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
(Said my car as I worked her wheel)
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
Do you love me for real? Do you love me for real?
(Said my car as I worked her wheel)

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
On the boulevard, oh my Lord
Her heels so high, she skipped the curb and ran in your yard
She's so, super fly
Crushed linen inside
This shit way too old, for me to drive
But I really don't care at all
She let me white her walls, and uh, pop her trunk
Turn her out, give her thump
Cause she need it
And she want it
There's no denying how I feel
Cause this love feels so real

[Hook: Mara Hruby]

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Oh the boulevard, she go hard
No matter where and when, if I push her buttons she start
So, out of sight
Shawty cold as ice
Ain't no shame in her game, you just ain't her type
That ain't no lie at all
She creep and crawl
And without a stall or a pause, I break her off
Cause she need it and she want it
Theres no denying how I feel
Cause this love feels so real

[Hook: Mara Hruby]

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Never ever have I ever seen a girl like you before
I love to hug onto your curves don't ever let me go
Hold on tight, I'll run the light, the peddle to the floor
And take us higher than we've ever been
(A place where no one goes)
Lets go
(A place where no one knows)
Lets go

[Hook: Mara Hruby]
