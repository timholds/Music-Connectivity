Sub-cult fantasy, vampire love
A carnal sacrifice of the virgin dove
In the midnight court I scent your blood
Innocence drowning in the flood

Tonight I want you in my arms
It's not the end, no
Tonight I'll place you safe from harm
It's not the end, no
Yeah
Oohh

Victorian repression, I fantastise
Chromium lips and metallic eyes
The reverse cowgirl death defies
Virginal sinners tell sadisitic lies

Tonight i want you in my arms
It's not the end, no
Tonight i'll place you safe from harm
It's not the end, no

Soul searching on your knees
The time is always now for eternity
Black death market uniform
Submit unto my kiss and you'll be reborn
Yeah yeah

Sub-cult fantasy, vampire love
Erotic bombshell, she's the god above
Give me cardinal sin, sensual head
Vapour trail vision, I'm glad I'm dead

Tonight I want you in my arms
It's not the end, no
Tonight I'll place you safe from harm
It's not the end, no

Tonight I want you in my arms
It's not the end, no
Tonight I need to feel your charms
It's not the end, no
It's not the end, no (It's not the end, no)
It's not the end, no (It's not the end, no)
It's not the end, no (It's not the end, no)
