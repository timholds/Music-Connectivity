Verse 1
Before I was formed
When I was born
When I was 10-years-old
When I moved out
When I rejected the law
When I had doubts
When I could see that I failed
When I dropped out
When I was in denial
When I called ‘em “minor details.”
When I would shout
When I just couldn’t be saved
When I would cuss you out for failing in fulfilling my way
When I would pray
When I would return
Would I make amends?
Would You forgive me?
Would I have to pay a price for my sins?
Or did You get me?
Did You witness all the things that I did?
And if You did would you despise me
Undermining all the stories you said?
Or would You find me, pick me out of everybody as kin
And remind me of that’s why You sent Him
When I seek grace from within
Would You embrace me, lift me out of disgrace?
Would You amaze me with the love that I could sense in Your face?
Would You abide in me and live in this place?
And walk beside me like a Father would His daughter with unfaltering grace?

CHORUS
For this life I’m forever thankful
(lemme tell you why)
I may have nothin’ to show
But at least I got it all
At least I got it all!


Verse 2
And I aspire to live higher, desire more than I ever did
Evidently I’ve been living focused on irrelevants
Irreverent:
My actions, words, thoughts and my sentiments
Had to take a step back – reflect a little bit
Reset intentions and
Deflect the negative
We let this world subdue us like a sedative
Pill popping to Armageddon
Lost all perspective
Act reckless
Thirty and fourty-year-old adolescents!?
LORD – take me to the bottom
That’s a blessing in disguise
Take me to the end of whatever I hide behind:
My occupation, my pride
My skills, and my lies
My arrogance, my greediness
The lust of my eyes
I’m a self-proclaimed self-involved self-centred arrogant chick
I got an answer that’ll shut your mouth quick
I got a cancer in my heart you can’t fix
I got resentments, I’m defensive, disconnected…
Let His grace flow in

CHORUS 2
For this life I’m forever grateful
I may mean nothing to you, and you, and you, and you, and you…
But in Him I got it all
But in Him I got it all
Just be thankful for what you got
I know to you, to you, to you, to you it might seem like nothing…
But in Him it’s a whole lot
(at least I got it all!)

Bridge (2 Corinthians 6:8-10)
Through glory and dishonor
Bad report and good report
Genuine, yet regarded as imposters
Known, yet regarded as unknown
Dying and yet we live on
Beaten, and yet not killed
Sorrowful, yet always rejoicing
Poor , yet making many rich
Having nothing, and yet possessing…
Everything

OUTRO
Oooohhh… for this life…
Oooooohhh…. For this Life!
