[Intro: Mino]
Uh
Hey Mino (woo)
You ready?
I'm ready
Yea, okey dokey yo

[Hook: Mino]
Is that true? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Is that true? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Really? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Say la la la la la la la la la la la

[Verse 1: Mino]
Who can refuse a big house with a large yard?
The dream I had since I was 20 is big big, Kim Bo Sung
When you were spacing out, busy sucking on honey
I’ve only waited to make money errday
A mustang in front of a green light
I want some cheeze cake
I want some deadpresident
Working at YG like a worker ant with no vacation
Live TV, events, fan signings, no such thing as free time
Where else can I release my talent?
Looked like a celebrity since I was a student
Don’t ask where I’m going, it’s too much for you to follow
You can’t be me, even if you keep trying
If you think my spoon looks like a gold spoon, go to the hospital
Even if you get LASIK, your vision will still be blurry
Bye bye

[Pre-hook: Zico]
If I had to chose between money and fame
I wouldn’t hesitate
And just take it all
Oh mother
Now go out and play all you want
And she said

[Hook: Mino]
Is that true? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Is that true? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Really? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Say la la la la la la la la la la la

[Verse 2: Zico]
I was born with nothing but now I have things
If that’s a relief, I wouldn’t have even touched music
You know hoo sure, becoming an artist who always has a full stomach and a warm back
I make all rappers and beat makers watch their backs
If you wanna live the good life, you can’t be slow
You need to endlessly bend your back
Before I sleep, I think of everything
R is VD and the laws of pulling things in
I showed everyone my qualification without any embarrassment
The top model of stars in training
Watch and learn my working
Why are you looking for bad things in lyrics?
Even if you put on your biased glasses, it’ll just be more 3D
You can try running at me like dogs and tearing me apart
I won’t give a shit, y’all are little flowers, I can easily trample on you
I won’t be confined to rap, my field is wide
My mom is blessed because of her kids
You’re so jealous, you go crazy and jump around

[Pre-hook: Mino]
If I had to chose between money and fame
I wouldn’t hesitate
And just take it all
Oh mother
Now go out and play all you want
And she said

[Hook: Mino]
Is that true? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Is that true? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Really? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Say la la la la la la la la la la la

[Bridge]
I stole money money, footsteps are light light
And now we goin up
Get what I wanted, okey dokey, money money
Just a whatever idol? Nope
We are the young boss boss
We have a lot of greed
Okey dokey yo

[Hook: Mino]
Is that true? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Is that true? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Really? Yes! Okey dokey yo
Say la la la la la la la la la la la
