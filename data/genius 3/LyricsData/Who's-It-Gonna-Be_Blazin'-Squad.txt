Who's it gonna be?

CHORUS
Who's it gonna be?
Is it him or is it me?
Stop playin' games
Girl,jus' tell me
I've gotta know
Who's it gonna be?

FLAVA
Yo,baby who's it gonna b?
Da X5's outside an' i'm lukin' 2 ride
It's 10 below zero
No fear,coz Flava'z gansta like Robert DeNiro
Dis boy,ur witness
An, u heard of me
I'm a shepherd dnt b concerned
Wiv a herd of sheep
Listen,my style's jus' so different from da rest
I'm handsome,intelligent
I no i ain't da best
But i've worked real hard
I've put da effort in
I've drove my skills upon da rhythm
I've listened,it's easy believe me
It's simple
I'll show u how we turn dis
************ upside down
I luv ur dimples
Ur smile,it drives me wild
Yea,all jumps inside
It's ur eyes
Dat's got me hypnotised,evritime
Stop,believin' wat u heard from ur friends
I ain't a playa
I jus' link da girls in da end

CHORUS X2

Sippin' drinks on fire

Quick,ur runnin' out of time

CHORUS X2

KRAZY
Yo,who's it gonna b?

But if u dnt want it

Bump,bump an' grindin'

If u ain't i'm not givin'
My heart 4 it
U got a choice of 2
Is it me or him?
It dnt bother me
Coz eitha way i'll win
Coz if u can have 2 guys
Then i can have 2 girls
Dat's da way it goes
Wen ur livin' in my world
I still wnt gettin' down wiv u
I ain't lettin' my feet leave da ground 4 u
