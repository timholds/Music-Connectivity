Can you hear the cheering from the room next door Thought you were having fun well have some more We're lucky to still be alive Dance while we're still alive

Well everybody's going to New York Pizza's better there you find them everywhere But we don't need no stinking badges We're on a Danish boat trying to stay afloat Give me some air We're not getting evil yet But we'll reach the continent...

Did you hear the cheering from the room next door Thought you were having funn well have some more We're lucky to still be alive We move while we're still alive While we're still alive

See me do the Wolf Dance Cringe till you go blue but this is what we do Sometime the ride will get bumpy I think the band sounds pretty good Go go Johnny B Good Gotta love the drum machine If that one's got no soul Well then you're pretty cold

Come on like Lindsey Buckingham going ooh aah ooh aah

We're lucky to still be alive We'll dance while we're still alive While we're still alive
