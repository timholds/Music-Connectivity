[Intro]
My man don't love me no more
He said he needed a little time
To clear his mind
Meanwhile I'm losing mine

[Verse 1]
We're at the crossroads, my dear
Where do we go from here?
Maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay
Oh, I know I'm gonna miss you either way

[Chorus]
It's such a lonely road (where do we go from here?)
All I can do is
Follow the tracks of my tears, oh

[Verse 2]
When I cry your name, am I calling in vain?
Oh am I waiting only to drown in pain, oh
Don't you do it, no, said don't you leave me this way
I don't know if I can lift my head and face another day

[Chorus]
Oh it's such a lonely road (where do we go from here?)
All I can do is
Follow the tracks of my tears (tears)

[Bridge]
Usually not the kind of girl who's lost and looking for direction
Who could this be, staring at me
When I'm looking in the mirror trying to find a resolution
Me too far gone, to find my way home

[Outro]
Where do we go from here?
All I can do is
Follow the tracks of my tears, oh
Where do we go from here? (maybe you won't go, maybe you'll stay)
All I can do is
Follow the tracks of my tears (follow either way)
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
