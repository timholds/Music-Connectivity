[Verse 1]
You got me, baby, I got you back
Looking at you, thinking about
All of the ways that you know me
I can't get enough
We got the future, but in the past
Good and the bad, making it last
We are what I want and I want what I already got

[Pre-Chorus]
When you come through the room
I know that you know
If you fall, I will be there
Let's light up like the moon
Yeah, we're taking off, make it even brighter

[Chorus]
That's what I like about you (hey-ey)
That's what I li-li-li-li-like
Tell me what you gonna do
You know that I want you, won't ya (You know that I need you)
That's what I like about you (hey-ey)
That's what I li-li-li-li-like
When you put me in the mood (hey-ey)
That's what I li-li-li-li-like
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you

[Verse 2]
Together, forever, forever for real
Close your eyes, we will forget what we know
Just jump in and let's go for a ride
All through the night, all through the day
Turn up the light, show me the way
Oh, what I want and I want what I already got

[Pre-Chorus]
When you come through the room
I know that you know
If you fall, I will be there
Let's light up like the moon
Yeah, we're taking off, make it even brighter

[Chorus]
That's what I like about you (hey-ey)
That's what I li-li-li-li-like
Tell me what you gonna do
You know that I want you, won't ya (You know that I need you)
That's what I like about you (hey-ey)
That's what I li-li-li-li-like
When you put me in the mood (hey-ey)
That's what I li-li-li-li-like
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you

[Bridge]
When you call my name
When you pull me in
When you kiss my lips
Hey, that's what I like
When you look like that
Make me feel like this
Baby, don't forget
Hey, that's what I like (hey-ey)

[Chorus]
That's what I like about you (hey-ey)
That's what I li-li-li-li-like
Tell me what you gonna do
You know that I want you, won't ya (You know that I need you)
That's what I like about you (hey-ey)
That's what I li-li-li-li-like
When you put me in the mood (hey-ey)
That's what I li-li-li-li-like
That's what I like about you
That's what I like about you
