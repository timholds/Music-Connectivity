[Chorus]
Got the wild style, always been a foul child
Always been a foul, always, always been a foul child
Got the wild style, always been a foul child
Yo' guns go pow, yo', yo' guns go pow pow

[Verse 1:]
It goes born in the eighties, crazy green eyed cupid baby
Lady of the house resembled Princess Di on the daily
Pops had the wild style, guns went puh-pow
Cloned in the silk shirts, linen pants, dressed loud
White tuxedo with the cream interior
When he go out, gold chain, gold watch, leather seats, show out
Hold the brick cellular, drive around with the top down
Pinky ring long nail, daddy's girl, no doubt
I never had a clue cause my daddy kept me clued out
Kingpin drug lord front page shout out
Found out inherited his ego inherit clout
Got the curls and the grams, evil like a Joker mouth
Round about fifth grade I discovered I could lace some words together
Make them rhyme, impress all of my classmates
And I did, that was the beginning of my longest bid
Just like my pops I go blow when my words spit

[Verse 2:]
Uh huh, ever since I was little in middle school spitting riddles
Little do you know what I been through and what I'm capable of
Some take that literal, all y'all underlings pitiful
Middlemen simply get the middle finger with the flick of my thumb
I'm thick-skinned, never dumb, hit the track and I run
Y'all been a bit slow, predictable cause father was calm
I got nothing to prove no more
Comparable to conditions like vegetables
Hit the switch in the booth and I'm done
Look what you made me do, daddy, I commend you
I swore off this rap like a witness swear on biblicals
I could give a uh about making this thing viable
I was born a different type of breed with different molecules
I hate what I see in individuals in industry
I rather back and get my degree and keep my dignity
I know cats think they know what they know when they know it
I know one thing, y'all know nothing where I am going

[Verse 3:]
It goes in the year 2009 my spirit flies high
Unflawed child of God, I left y'all behind
Fine line between the foul and declared divine
You can say what's she rapping about now? That's fine
That's my way of telling you that I don't mince words
I am not a foul child no more, not her
Not now, not ever, back there I'm better
I am too clever to desire what you endeavour
No never can you convince me with rotten cheddar
Or whatever you got up your sleeve or strapped under your sweater
That's cool, you live, you die by that cheap tool
Even in his death L tell you what he went through
Foul child puh-pow where that leave em cold now
Even my own pops is a shadow, just an empty shell
Yeah he failed, I'm just stating facts from my own tale
How you live is what you believe and that's real
