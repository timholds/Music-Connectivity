[Intro]
Fellas, can we still do it?

[Verse 1]
Periodic measures to say my rhymes
Too much of this dope need growth-type slow
Off a poet's tree, let me blow my leaves
Shake off my roots and pull up my sleeves
Break a branchling wist stick
Lyrics for the mystical
Yo fancy, shake your chassis
Do the flamboukey
Acts of space, on the floor
Move your body do the dookey base
Mental I am, not the man or the merchant of ham
But I will stand
Up and enchantment to combat
With the duplex powerful
Rhymes you get down to, get down to
Maintain and claim a wax that I astound you
Went to the length of my radius
Brothers gotta protest and then maybe this
Situation that I kick incognito
Won't stop until the drop signs til the black people
And to that man playin'?  front knowledge
Cuz you ain't...

[Chorus]
Sayin nothin
Sayin nothin

[Speech]
Welcome, please find a seat
While gravitating to the rear where as you will note
There is no standing room only
My name for the record incidentally
Is Mr. M Logic
I have been retained as your host and instructor
For this half hour, two-hour length seminar
To briefly outline (Nothin)

[Verse 2]
Check out my lyric fathom
Fathom, and my harmony text
Yo, bust this TM steps
Play around get drowned
Cuz I go left
Me, Divine Styler the phonographic child of
The I, Self, Lord and master nation
I drop rhymes with fascination
So combust to a thesis
Of brother on a trigger
Pluckin to a beat not double M figures
Lick shot all the graphic
Place them on the staff and
Unroll the scroll of a million facts
And touche, my black offends
Exploit the unknown
But vexed intent
Subconscious trickery must dispense
Before the uprise touch eyes
Take a whiff of dissent
It's black coffee in case ya step
Down for the most highest on your knees
And the bredren school and the other team
Rastafari eyed Cockney
His dreadlock shed a lot of prophecies
But style of me
Is planting trees
For the scheme of end-like me
Properties of mind on the line
For a ? do a surgery
Ya heard of me Divine MD
On the clergy of G-O-D
Would you believe we're in living color
We're originally
In the right category of man's species
And forget all about that brimstone bluffin'
Because we're always saying 100% something
There's some of you who never and still won't be..

[Chorus]
Sayin nothin (Say what?)
Sayin nothin (Say what?)

The varied and detailed topics we will be covering
The main one being nullification and enhancement of the human psyche and vocabulary
Please take pen to hand as I will be moving quite lethargically fast while covering and saying (Nothin)
If you cannot hear in the rear, please rest assured we will be gradually, rapidly lowering the lighting levels and continuing as I was heretofore saying (Nothin)
We will now take a short recess of approximately four centuries
For a nutritious junk-food midday ingestion process
Please take a non-mental note as to which conference room has a sign on the door saying...

[Chorus]
Sayin nothin (I can't hear you)
Sayin nothin

[Outro]
Fellas, can we still do it?
