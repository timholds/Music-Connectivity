[First Verse: Nick Luebke]
I close my eyes, and start to dream
Thoughts go back, I was just thirtheen
When I knew that I could be anything I wanted
I never cared if anyone believes

[Bridge: Nick Luebke]
Because I knew, I knew that I could
Because I saw it, I saw it in my dreams
And I knew that's what I wanted I
Was gonna be big, bigger than myself
Never gonna settle for anything else

[Hook: Nick Luebke]
And I have always known
Where I'm going nothing holding me
Back by myself
I know I'm not alone
Chasin dreams but it seems so lonely now
So this is what I'm gonna do
Fighting through anything that I have to
To get to where I wanna be, I'm chasin' dreams

[Second Verse: Keem]
Just another kid, tryna find his purpose
And times is hard, but you know it's worth it
So I stripe for, type of life that you die for
Blood, sweating and tears
But they don't feel your pain so you cry for
When I was growing up, never thought about time of blowing up
Only thought about tryna help my mom if my pap was showing up
But I never worked out that way, it happened for a reason
I was doubted but I never stopped believing

[Bridge: Nick Luebke]
Because I knew, I knew that I could
Because I saw it, I saw it in my dreams
And I knew that's what I wanted I
Was gonna be big, bigger than myself
Never gonna settle for anything else

[Hook: Nick Luebke]
And I have always known
Where I'm going nothing holding me
Back by myself
I know I'm not alone
Chasin dreams but it seems so lonely now
So this is what I'm gonna do
Fighting through anything that I have to
To get to where I wanna be, I'm chasin' dreams

[Third Verse: Nick Luebke]
I feel like I'm doing what I have to
Found what i love and turned in it to an avenue
To express progress just let the sound match
Wagers looked in the front my chest
Music contains the mess
Finally found what I love
Here is the message blessing from above
I just pray that someday soon this dream comes true

[Hook: Nick Luebke]
And I have always known
Where I'm going nothing holding me
Back by myself
I know I'm not alone
Chasin dreams but it seems so lonely now
So this is what I'm gonna do
Fighting through anything that I have to
To get to where I wanna be, I'm chasin' dreams

And I have always known
Where I'm going nothing holding me
Back by myself
I know I'm not alone
Chasin dreams but it seems so lonely now
So this is what I'm gonna do
Fighting through anything that I have to
To get to where I wanna be, I'm chasin' dreams
