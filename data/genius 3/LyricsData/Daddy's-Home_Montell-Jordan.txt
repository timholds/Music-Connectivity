Do da da da
La da la
Play it, play it

I know, I'm not the man you thought I'd be
We started out so young
Your mother, and me
I know that I hurt you
I was a child trying to be a man
I walked out on my only son
I left you in your mother's hands
And now I'm standing right here
With tears, with tears streaming from my eyes
See your mother raised a fine young man
And I know I missed so much of your life

Look at me
Take a real good look at me
Don't turn away
Don't you turn away like I did my son
I'm making no more promises
I'm trying to find the word to say

Daddy's home (yeah)
Daddy's home (been gone too long)
Daddy's home (said your daddy's back home)
Daddy's home (and for every birthday that I missed my son)
Daddy's home (I'm gonna make it all up to you)
Daddy's home (everytime I made your mother cry)
Daddy's home (she laid awake at night, holding her pillow tight)
Daddy's home (oh oh)

Do you remember the day I walked out on you?
There was nothing I could say, nothing you could do
I missed your first words, I couldn't hear you talk
I missed your first steps, when you tried to walk, baby
Now I know and you know you can take care of yourself
You had to run, you had to run to somebody else
(Daddy's home)
Didn't be a good father, I wasn't there
But talk to me son, tell me how you feel

(Shappell Crawford)
Daddy why would you leave your only son
Give me somethin', I could hold on
You left me here alone
Now you've decided to come back home
And I realize
That's it's gonna take a little time for you and me to get again
I think we can do it, do you think we can do it?

If you wanna be my dad again
We've got to start all over, be friends
If you wanna be my dad again
We've got to start all over, be friends
If you wanna be my dad again
We've got to start all over, be friends
If you wanna be my dad again
We've got to start all over, be friends

(Montell)
Just look at me
Heeee, look at me
