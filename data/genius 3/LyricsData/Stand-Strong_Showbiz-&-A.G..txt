[Verse 1: A.G.]
Now I never took a loss but I took shorts of course
I'm known to hold my own - can you hold yours?
Shine like neon so call me Dion
You wanna be on my side, take a ride to the Pelon
141st is my residence
Try to jack me for my dead presidents you'll get left with no evidence
I'm not a gun-toting hooligan
But if you catch me on the humble and wanna rumble, I have to do you in
A million dollar mind, now why would I waste it?
Face it, I'm so close to the top that I can taste it
Get complex or stay basic
Crazy ill flow and punchlines is what my rhymes are laced with
The ladies date me so the chumps hate me
Got more soul than gravy and grits and making hits like a strong safety
You start dissing, that's when I'm bitching
Yes take heed to life right, stop, look and listen
Cause the Giant's on a mad mission
Suckers sampled off the LP with no goddamn permission
They like our style that's why they choose it
Might as well let me write your rhymes and let Show do all your music
Meanwhile back to the BX

[Hook]
I gotta get mine and stand strong
(Why?) Cause you can't keep a good man down for long
(Repeat x2)

[Verse 2: A.G.]
Mister Boogie Down, straight from the Boogie Down
One four one, that's where I learned to get my raps from
I hate a ??? teacher think she can link me
Holding her ground while she's wrapped around my pinkie
Your weakness couldn't never twist this
My style is shining while I'm down low like a mistress
Get with this cause it's the flavor
Be on your best behavior, telling all your news it's your neighbor
Like a gentlemen I'm classy, like sex I'm nasty
Show's getting jazzy and the hoes still trying to gas me
I slapped a daydreamer
Get your mind out the gutter cause my house'll be a streamer
Went through stages like a lion in trapped cages
Had to flip like pages, they're amazed that we made this
Myself and he, yeah the brother Show
Me, AG, here's the little bro
Shortie and Jordan, B.O. and Mack they get shouts
As-Salaam Alaikum to Shabazz and I'm out

[Hook x2]
