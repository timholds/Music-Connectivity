[Hook: Dels]
You had me feeling like a pack of wolves
I launch attack, you arch your back, come holler at the moon
You had me drowning in your love
Watch the memories turn to dust...
You had me feeling like a pack of wolves
I launch attack, you arch your back, come holler at the moon
You had me drowning in your love
Watch the memories turn to dust...

[Verse 1: Dels]
I’m rapping like a computer because I’m typing up an email
To let you know I love you so if I miss out any details
CC’ing all my ex’s because they’re filling up my inbox with their spam
I hope they get the plan, damn get lost
Double space bar, I made an error with you
As I backspace to outer space back to you
This message was left in my drafts
Gathering digital dust I’ve got ask for your heart back...
What I did was a dark act
I can’t detract from the truth, or that
I dented your pride, I am blinded by lights, sigh
Baby don’t cry, Why?
Saw life with a glass eye
When I had you, When I had your heart
One hand on your soul
Where will I go? What will I do?
It was supposed to be me and you, me and you

[Verse 2: Dels]
I’m typing kind of fast because writing on my launch break
I’m sorry for the typos, for capped locked words, no space
For the paragraphs, visual stammer
Poor grammar, frantic manner
You dropped a hammer on my head
And now I’m dead, now I’m dead!
Damn you killed me with the words
Many tears were shed now I’m sleeping with the worms
I’m dancing with the devil with two left feet
Doing the bogel, even since you left me
Now, now, now
Now, now, now I’m feeling like a nuisance
You’re holding up a shooter because you’re gunning for solutions
Your outcome don’t include me so the visions kind of soothing
You’re clearing out the closet, home improvement, now I’m screwing
Troubles brewing, so fluent in it
A mirror image of my past now living in it
I’m feeling livid...
What is a life without you?
You reply, what is a life without truth?!
