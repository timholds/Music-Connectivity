[Intro]
High, hi-high
High, hi-high, ohhh
High, hi-high
High, hi-high,ohhh
(Can't get this shit open)

[Verse 1]
Pain reliever
Fever reducer
Ten to the head
Does that make me a loser?
I took nine shots of that fifth
Gone, gone, gone
Eight hits of that spliff
Gone I got
Seven reasons why I'm not sure of six things
On my mind and I'm comin' off this high five

[Hook]
Feel  me for nothing
Don't even love me for me
Love me for nothing
Don't even love me for free

Second verse on my third beer
Kill all these voices that I feel I hear
Mob to the bride, I'm
Keeping the faith, I'm
Holding the fight, A
Hell of a night
It's a hell of a night
Ahhhhahhhhahhh

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Only when I'm alone
Only when I was on one
(one one one one)
Live like I'm living today
Live like today was my last one
(one one one one)

[Bridge]
Falling from this high
(falling falling)
From this high
(one one one one)

[Hook]

[Outro]
All that I pray
I pray when I die, I die real

All that I pray
I pray when I die, I die real
(I know, But prefer my eyes low)
