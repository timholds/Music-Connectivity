[Hook]
You should come on over
Come a little closer
Take away my misery
Show me dark fantasies

[Verse 1]
Baby you should come on over
Get on in a little closer
Baby you should come on over
Let me spread ya legs open
Open my heart up, but close the curtains
I don't want nobody to see me liven' out my dark fantasy
Can't's you see that i'm not in the mood for fuckin' foreplay
Skip the bullshit, and go straight to fuckin' doggy
I'm sorry that's your skull is getting' crushed into the headboard
Harder than the beat of these drums
The blood sheds more
All over the walls, sheets, pillows, and covers
Thrustin' all my pain inside the body of another
Bitch you can scream all that you want
I'm not gonna stop till I bust a nut
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Let me suck on your teats, and massage ya little feets
Let me roll you up in this carpet and puts you in the backseat
NIN blastin' through the stereo
Reznor tellin' me that i'm an animal while i'm diggin' a hole six below
Ya know
All this shit could a been avoided if you just didn't fuckin' toy wit my emotions and exploit 'em
It was torturous
Now i'm diggin' a hole up in this forest
Pondering if I wanna butt fuck your rotting carcass
Before I bury you, and say my final goodbye
I pull you in, and holds you close just one last time
[Hook]
