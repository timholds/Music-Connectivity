Somebody to love
Can you hear me
I want somebody to love

Somebody to love
Somebody to love

And I know she can hear me say (oh hey hey oh hey hey)

I want Somebody to love
Some-Somebody to love

No I won't stop until she's with me(oh hey hey oh hey hey)

Oshiete hoshii what's love
Ai tsuujirutte uwasa
No one yet hajimete
Kanjiru konna kanjou

I'm falling for you twenty-four
Mitsumeru no wa it's you
Mune sawagi how should I control
My heart and soul

Haji wo shinonde mo excuse me miss
Kakushin dekinakute moii I got you babe
Ore ni sukoshi demo mochi mika arunara
Ima kono toki kara kokoro wo yudanete yo

Somebody to love
Somebody to love

And I know she can hear me say (oh hey hey oh hey hey)

I want Somebody to love
Some-Somebody to love

No I won't stop until she's with me(oh hey hey oh hey hey)

When I say, somebody
Then you say, to love
When I say, somebody
Then you say, to love

Somebody (to luv)
Somebody (to luv)
Somebody (to luv)
Somebody to love

Now that I got plenty hope
I can't wait, yo, as we go just two of us
On and on the love zone we're takin' it in
Doin' all the above all over again
Move it to the kitchen take my hand
Be my angel, ring my bell

That's what I'm sayin' oh
I'm feelin' like a million, yo
You do make my dream come true

Gotta let the whole world know
Si-Sit back relax no sound
I'm'ma turn that on to the break o' dawn
Indeed you we gon' make it bounce

Make it bounce
Make it bounce

Somebody to love
Somebody to love

And I know she can hear me say (oh hey hey oh hey hey)

I want Somebody to love
Some-Somebody to love

No I won't stop until she's with me(oh hey hey oh hey hey)

Modokashii kimochi ga uzu maku tabi
Mune ni tsunoru omoi ga afure dasu

Kimi e todoku you I sing this love song
You need somebody to love too
Somebody to love you

Dare ka wo aishite
Dare ka ni aisare
Dare ka to wakare doko kade mata

Dare ka ga dare ka to meguri au naka
Kore ga saigo no love

Somebody to love
