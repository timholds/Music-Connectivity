You'll never change, neither will I, we'll stay the same till the days that we die
I'll never win, neither will you, so what in this world are we gonna do
People hate change, they make a fuss, they stay the same, people like us
Folks wanna win, when they can choose, but more important than that, folks don't wanna lose

When did it start how did it go wrong
Why in this world can't we get along
Each victory should be good news
But when I have to win you're the one that I lose

I wanna change but I don't know how
We need to change though, I know that now
Its sad but its true and I have to say, that the days that we die aren't that far away

You'll never change neither will I
We'll stay the same till the days that we die
I'll never win, neither will you
So what in this world are we gonna do?
