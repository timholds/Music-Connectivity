[Verse 1]
Well you can go and buy some stuff
But it will never be enough
To fill the void that's in your soul
But I got something to fill that hole

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, everything you want is right here in my pants
Everything you need, come on and take that chance
You know I got what you want

[Chorus]
I got what you want baby
I got what you want baby
I got what you want baby
I got what you want baby

Five and a half inches of love

[Verse 2]
Well you can date a thousand guys
But what I got between my thighs
Is like the sun cause it's always high
And like a compass it always points to your G-Spot

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, everything you want is right here in my pants
Everything you need to cure your menstrual cramps
You know I got what you want

[Chorus]
I got what you want baby (I got what you want)
I got what you want baby (I got what you need)
I got what you want baby (Baby lickin' your lips)
I got what you want baby

Five and a half inches of love

[Hook]
I can give you what you need
You and I were to born to rock
Let me fill you with my sack

There ain't no other guy around
Who's gonna fill you up downtown

[Chorus]
I got what you want
I got what you want baby (I got what you need)
I got what you want baby (C'mon give me the chance)
I got what you want baby
I got what you want baby (I got what you want)
I got what you want baby (I got what you need)
I got what you want baby (Owww)
I got what you want baby

Five and a half inches of love

Let me lick on your balls
I mean wait suck on my balls, baby
That's what I meant to say
Yeah I'm not gay, no, no
