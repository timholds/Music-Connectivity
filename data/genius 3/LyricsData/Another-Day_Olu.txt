[Verse 1]
Got me feeling like Stanford
After the NFL draft, I'm out of luck
My doctor said to cherish life
But it kinda sucks
Some think that life's a rainbow
With a pot of gold
Waiting for you on the other side
With your other goals
I think thats fucking gay
In real life the sky's are grey
The system ain't designed
For us to make it in this time of day
Cause while you're living in your dream world
I bet your dream girls doing shit she'll regret
Just so her rent is paid
I talk shit for all the things that I believe in
Opinions never mattered to me
I don't need a reason
To listen to whatever you got to say to me
I want you to hate me
So I cannot give a fuck
Your little words cannot phase me
The people I grew up with think that I'm crazy
To the point where even I am starting to think that I'm Crazy
Maybe I'm crazy, just maybe
Or maybe society fucked up
When they were trying to enslave me
Cause people are basic
Its always the same shit
Like everywhere I go feel like i came out a spaceship
So I get high as Jason Statham in Crank
Except its all for that dank
I'm coolin' out my nigga

[Hook]
I was blind til' I heard em say
That nothings ever promised tomorrows today
But I just put my hands together
Bowed down and I prayed
And then I pass out, until I see a new day
And then I wake up, cause I heard em' say
That nothings ever promised tomorrows today
So I get up, stretch a bit, and I light a j
And grind it out, cause tomorrows another day, aye

[Verse 2]
So maybe I'm crazy, just maybe
Like what if Mercedes miscarriage her baby
Or maybe I will die in my eighties
Sort of like my great aunt
Sister of Mercedes, AKA my mommas momma
She had trauma and a tad of schizophrenia
It runs in the family
I hope it skips my generation though
It ain't really common for my type to even live to see twenty
I'll be lucky if I see ?, that'd be plenty
Sixty years of tears seeing those I knew
Pass before I do
Kinda makes me think that life is overrated
Because the good die young
And the young never make it
Unless they pick a path that was different than the makers
I don't mean a college major
I mean an individual
Live your own life, make your money
Don't be fickle though
Buy something that fits you
Its cool to have a passion
But make sure its realistic so you can actually have it
But really though, only fools believe in magic
So if you got a shot to get it
Better grab it

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
My uncle took his own life for his lifestyle
Put a gun to his head when I was just a child
Momma never liked to talk about it
It's a touchy subject
Like it would suck to lose your little brother
And I just hope that history does not repeat itself
The kid is fucking up
And its apparent that he needs some help
Cause I am not around to show him there is a bigger picture
And it would feel pretty shitty
Living passed your little sibling
I blame our society, the devil is the industry
Demons work at BET, same shit up at MTV
Thats why I fuck with Netflix
Cause cable will erase your personality
Replace it with some kind of false reality
Robots and more bops
Yeah, most people are basic, face it
Thats why I fuck with Basegod
He's making the shit he wants to create
And don't give a fuck what you say
So in that sense, the two of us relate
That's crazy
But I am not crazy, for I am not basic
In fact in my own mind, I think I'm amazing
You know I'm amazing, afraid cause I'm capable
An undercover mastermind, but I just play it off

[Hook]
