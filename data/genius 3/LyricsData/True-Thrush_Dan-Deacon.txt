BEAST ON MY BRAIN
EVERY THOUGHT IS THE SAME
IF THE BEAST IS CONTROLLED
IT'LL NEVER TURN GOLD
AND THAT'S JUST FINE
(WE DON'T OWN THE WORLD AROUND US)

DON'T TOUCH THE FLAME
OR THE BURNS IT BECAME
LIVE THE LIES YOU'VE BEEN SOLD
AS A NIGHTMARE UNFOLDS
IF YOU DON'T MIND
(NO HOPE COMES FROM THOSE WHO BOUND US)

HEY THERE OLD OWL
I'M LOST AND ALONE
NO HEAD TO HOLD HIGH
BUT MY FEET KEEP ON GOING
(EVOM UOY ,EVOM I NEHW)

SPREAD THOSE WINGS WIDE
AND TAKE ME ALONG
NOW SHOW ME THE SKY
THEN TELL ME I'M HOME
(EVOM UOY ,EVOM I NEHW)

HEY THERE OLD LADY
PLEASE SING ME A SONG
SING OF DAYS GONE BY
BEFORE I WENT WRONG
(EVOM UOY ,EVOM I NEHW)

HEY HEY HEY I DON'T KNOW
WHICH WAY I'M GOING
WHEN I LOOK PAST YOUR EYES
I CAN BARELY HANG ON
(EVOM UOY ,EVOM I NEHW)
