[Verse 1]
California burrito and a smile, being idle, ignoring idols, flying high
I might buy a Cruiserweight Title replica
I'm above writing raps in Helvetica
I made a typeface; I grew a language
I destroyed your galaxy, cause in it, Pok√©mon was real, Erika dealt grass, Brock ran a brothel in Pewter
Etcetera
I think it's time I hold the pair I grew
I'm not scared of you, I built a lair for truth
Quite frankly, the Klaus Baudelaire of the booth, which is actually a bedroom for two
I caught the dorm room blues, but today is a good day
All the symptoms are in sedation
Frustrations tucked away like grades when you know that C is gonna make your dad peeved, so...

[Hook]
Bury that depression in your bookbag
Appear good even when your soul looks bad
Be brave in the face of uncertainty
Behave in public and show courtesy
Build a moat, and fill that thang' with Haterade
Address worry and save for peace for later days
We gon' build sum'n nice today
We gon' build sum'n nice today

[Verse 2]
The faint of heart cry in mason jars, and I sip coolly
Cruelly, I took candy from a baby, and replaced it with a mic to encourage the youth to speak out about their plight
Reverse psychology; orchestrated rebellion
Angel-fy the hellions, hell-ify the Melvins
Smash televisions, kick start revolutions
This is not a drill, it's Chiraq's solution
I feel like the arbiter of the universe
I'ma have to ask haters to disperse, this is a "no flex without representation" zone
Tell Rich Gang pay us what they owe
I want racks of brain cells and a brick of Blow Pops
How many licks for respect on O-Block?
Roll that Tootsie for a scholar
Holler if you heard me on a song and gained a new power

[Hook]
