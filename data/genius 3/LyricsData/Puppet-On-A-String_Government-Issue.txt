I never thought that I'd fall
I never thought I'd be so happy
I never thought we'd fall apart
I guess that it had to happen

I'm a puppet on a string
I can't help thinking about you
I'm a puppet on a string
I don't know how I'll live without you
Now I find myself so sad
Hard to deal with all the pain
I say I'll never do it again
But I keep on searching for my dream girl
