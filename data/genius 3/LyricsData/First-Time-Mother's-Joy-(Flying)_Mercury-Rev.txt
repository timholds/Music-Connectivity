Everywhere you turn you are, surrounded by the sound
Of winter's song
Everything is frozen and, only the swans have chosen
To be strong

The skies are all a big commotion, somewhere the birds are all in motion
(Yearning to be back)
And home where they belong

An the love you once thought, long faded out of view
Was there all along, and right in front of you
An look at you now you're flying..too
You're flying too

Soon the dormant patient roots will show themselves as childish shoots
(Watered by the tears)
Of a first-time mother's joy

Lil' streams of consciousness, they tumble over rocks they kiss
(Unafraid of who they are)
Of what will happen next

And the love you once thought (you once thought), long faded out of view
Was there all along (all along), and in ways you never knew
And the birds you once thought (you once thought), long gone ahead of you
They were there all along, and right in front of you
An look at you now you're flying...too
