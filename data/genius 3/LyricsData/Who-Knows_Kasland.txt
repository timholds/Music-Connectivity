[Verse 1]
Attention all the guards all throughout the asylum
Mr. K. Sleezy's gone and we just can't find him
Patient on the loose and it appears he killed his cellmate
Get Victoria Justice we're going to need some jail bait
You're trying to find me get behind me kiss my shiny whitey heiney
Watch the lightening sliding guide me through my mind oh my I'm mighty
Doctor, doctor you can't find me get a tranq and try to fight me
There's no one in this world that's like me crazy, mental, slightly psyche
Take every chance I see to slip into the dispensary
Full of curiosity and let the Ambien answer me
Overdose on pills sweet to me like a tangerine
Cause I grabbed a whole handful and ate them til my hands were clean
Now I'm starting to foam at the mouth and my eyes are turning
To the back of my head, my toes are red, and my thighs are burning
I determine I'm a burden to myself yeah I am certain
Live in an asylum see no light just hear the crows chirping

[Hook]
Sometimes I wonder where my mind goes
I ask all my friends, but nobody knows
Sometimes I wonder if my insanity shows
Will I ever be sane? who the hell knows

[Verse 2]
Walking down the halls and I freak out after hearing a
Very scary noise so I run and hide in the cafeteria
Eat a bowl of Sleezy-O's and feed the whole remedial class
Shove my demo up a record label C.E.O.'s ass
Man I got balls like some minerals
Rock hard genitals I call them my generals
Sit down for breakfast east some Mentos and some Eggo's
On a plate that's made of Lego's while I'm wearing pink stilettos
Damn, I'm starting to think that there is something wrong with me
What the hell is a retard and why do you keep calling me
Stupid, retarded, mentally psycho
You keep calling me names then mental I might go
I know I'm so crazy though
My songs can't be played on the radio
You say the pills did it well that may be so
But I've been crazy since I was a baby though

[Hook]
