Tick, tock, tick, tock;
In this town
When I set it off -
Can nobody stop it in time?
I'm like a B-52
When I'm jockin' a rhyme;
I'm tired of beefin' with you -
Cock-blocking my shine
So stop talkin' and find another place to play
Before I Travolta your face away
Get your hands high -
Will you take my grace away?
Like a vampire
You don't want to face the day
I'll make you break away
Like tires slippin' in the rain
You'll be drippin' in your shame
When your sinking in the drain
I'm gonna stick it in my veins
I'll be thinking I'm insane
I suggest that you rest, rest -
- tickin' in my brain
Get the fuck outta here -
And duck out of fear
'cause my flow is an 8-ton truck out of gear
Yeah, I heard your album -
Get your junk out of my ear;
Congrats, you're the d-d-dumbfuck of the year
We just don't give a fuck, uh-huh
We just don't give a fuck, yeah
We just don't give a fuck
So fuck y'all -
Break it down!
(DAMN) ----? ('we should welcoming that'? 'gonna walk it like that'?)
(DAMN) It's been a long time
(DAMN) We gonna rap it the best that we can
Lot a shit to repeat
(DAMN) ----? (")
(DAMN) It's been a long time
(DAMN) We gonna rap it as best that we can
Uh -
B-b-b-reak it break down like this!
