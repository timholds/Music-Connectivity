48 BARZ OUT THE BLUE

[Verse 1: Imp]

I came to stake my claim cause
You’ll want erase my name huh
Right out the history books so
I got to let the whole world know
Exclude me from your movies
Fuck you your crew and your groupies
I give a fuck if your rap like an Uzi
Or freestyle cause your bars don’t move me
I left the block with the rocks, and the pot
And the narcs, the cops, shots, for the Good Life
It was an open mic on Thursday night
Where flows were tight my escape from the hood life
A couple of guys a girl or two
A poet, a band, a rapper and some bomb health food
You couldn’t cuss if you cursed goodbye, goodnight
Come back next week just don’t be rude
The crowd grew now every week I’m battling
I’m from Harlem is that what had them rattling
An accent and niggers don’t like that
They bombed first you know I had to strike back
They clicked up I also been a soloist
I kicked butt for those who tried to go at this
I put hands on niggers like masseuses
And pulled up in that 6 double deuces
Sound man, security, rapper
Beat maker, gambler, scrapper
The weed man, I was all of the above
Forty acres and mule, still I get no love
Okay lets get it in, get it on
Loud mouth rappers I’m a make you make a better song
Good life reunion these nuts
Cause it ain’t no reunion if the Imp at on
You jacked Chub Rocks style
I heard you ain’t on crack now
That’s good cause you my pal
But I'll spank you like you my child
P Blowed who’s this Johnny come lately
I made your first damn flyer do you love or you hate me
I get abstract love, but the rest real flakey
I am what I am, no clone so you ain’t make me
Bust a nut in the life and the blowed was the baby
Daddy’s home but the kids went crazy
Hid all his footage like his battle with Shady
If you cool share the footage of Imp from the 80’s
Grown men acting like a bunch of ladies
Otherwise wrecked my car and still ain’t pay me
I let that slide now I’m fugazi
In 2016 I’m gone damn crazy
Bamm!
