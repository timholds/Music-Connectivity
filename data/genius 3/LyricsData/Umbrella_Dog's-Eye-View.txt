Did you like the flowers I sent?
You could've called to thank me
Well, you could've called

And I tried to kiss you on Brooklyn Avenue
But you got in your car before I could move

And I've been falling like the rain
But you've got your umbrella in my way

Fists and fingers, tongues and teeth
I want to see you, I'm tired of my dreams
Nights of wishing, I could open my mouth
And when I finally did speak, you were nowhere to be found

I've been falling like the rain
But you've got your umbrella in my way

I had the sun in my hand
I had the sun in my hand
I had the sun 'til you said you liked the rain
I had it all in my hands, I had it all, but I gave it all away

Did I scare you off by being honest?
How come we never see the end 'til it's right there upon us?
If you want, I can go away
But like the rain, I'll come again some other day

And I've been falling like the rain
But you've got your umbrella in my way again

One of these days, I'm going to show up in the sunshine
Be a little sunshower, fall upon you, make you rise up like a flower
You can be my little daisy
Be my daisy
