[Verse 1]
When I was young my buddies used to call me Jesse James
Living with the hammer down, just trying to beat the train
I'd jump them tracks, don't look back, leave the law behind
A finger out the window while that police siren whines

[Chorus]
Crazy's something that I know
Hell I been to Mexico
Juarez ain't got nothing on that woman
And fast ain't nothing new to me
I've been to Bristol Tennessee
Them boys are standing still
Next to that woman

[Verse 2]
She's smiling like it's Sunday and she's singing in the choir
Them curves of hers are smoking and she's trying to start a fire
Yeah, the way she's looking at me I know I should run and hide
Instead I'm thinking hello Bonnie, you can call me Clyde

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yeah, when the good Lord made her, man, He did it mighty well
If He's got something better, must have kept it for Himself
And I'd walk through hell to be next to that woman
The freight train never hit me cause I made it across the rails
And I never went to prison, cause my brother made my bail
How she's going to get me, well I guess it just depends
I haven't seen this movie but I know the way it ends, yeah

[Chorus][x2]
