Hola, good morning light up a joint
Smoke a lil bit, then get right to the point
Go and nod your head to the sound of my voice and cook up a little breakfast
Whatever your choice may be
Bacon, eggs, and great weed
Wake and bake and stay skeef

Cause this about to be a chill day I can feel it
So finish off that joint or kill it
Cause you feeling so alive right now
So alive, never later, never live later
Live for today and find that you can't be touched by a hater

Cause you living in the past
But today I got class, so I don't got a time for that, I gotta go
But I’ll be back like a Spinal Tap

You know I'm O-lu
Just a lil homie that they go, to
When they need a little bit of flow, to
Get through the day I stay in one of these songs like Jay press play

Have a little fun, sip
Blaze, smoke another blunt
Turn, this up instead of just bumps and shake your ass, whatever I'm done
Do what you love, chase what you want
Instead of having it all, I'd rather have fun
I get high just to chill for a second
And come down feeling ready

Say what are you gon do today?
Make money ya’ll
What you gon do today?
Spend money ya’ll
What you gon do today?
Raise kids ya’ll
What you gon do today?
Write raps ya’ll
What you gon do today?

I’ma go, hit it like never befoe
Take a little dro, get a little ass at the class
From the girl that I’ve been checking out, for the last 2 weeks
Acting like she never knew me
Life never plays out like the movies
I just wanna cut to the action, no lights, no cameras, no acting involved
This is me in the flesh, unscripted
This is what you wanted, that chill shit?
But can you really feel this?
No Pinocchio, this is real shit
I just killed this, and brought it back to life
And killed it again with a butter knife
I’m eating toast on a boat in the ocean
Aloe vera track like lotion

What you gon do today?
Ok, blow trees ya’ll
What you gon do today?
No sleep ya’ll
What you gon do today?
Cook dinner ya’ll
What you gon drink with that?
Pellegrino ya’ll
What you gon do today?
Fix my car ya’ll
What you gon do today?
Going far ya’lll
What you gon do today?
Move shit ya’ll
What you gon do today?
Find shit ya’ll

Seriously? you crazy, this dude is crazy right here
Yo aloe vera, that’s like the ingredient in lotion so…

Say What you gon do today?
What you gon do today? […I’ma all-overa her track like lotion…I don’t know]
What you gon do today?

...whatever my mind runs in friggin circles yo
