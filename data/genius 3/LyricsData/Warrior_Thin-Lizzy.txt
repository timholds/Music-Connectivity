I am the warrior
I serve the death machine
Losers or conquerors
All flash oh, past on my silver screen
Death is no easy answer
For those who little wish to know
Just ask those who have been before you
What fate does the future holds
It ain't pretty
I am a messenger
The message here, you ask to know
I am the warrior
I deliver the fatal blow
So fate will have to wait
Till time can heal the scar
See my heart is ruled by Venus
And my head by Mars
