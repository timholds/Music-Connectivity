[Hook]
No, I don't want your number
I don't wanna give you mine
I don't wanna meet you nowhere
I don't wanna waste my time

[Chorus]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy 'can't get no love from me
Hanging on the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy can't get no love from me
Hanging on the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

[Hook]
No, I don't want your number
I don't wanna give you mine
I don't wanna meet you nowhere
I don't wanna waste my time

[Chorus]
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy 'can't get no love from me
Hanging on the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
I don't want no scrubs
A scrub is a guy 'can't get no love from me
Hanging on the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me
