So we back in the club
Get that bodies rockin from
Side to side (Side to side)
Thank God the week is done
I feel like a zombie gone
Back to life (Back to life)
Hands up, and suddenly we all got our
Hands up
No control of my body
Ain't I seen you before?
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
So dance, dance, like
It's the last, last night of
Your life, life
Gonna get you right
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
Keep downing drinks like this
Not tomorrow that just right now, now, now
Now, now, now
Gonna set the roof on fire
Gonna burn this mother f*cker down, down, down
Down, down, down
Hands up, when the music drops
We both put our hands up
Put your hands on my body
Swear I seen you before
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
So dance, dance, like
It's the last, last night of
Your life, life
Gonna get you right
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us fallin' in love again
