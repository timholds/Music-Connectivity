[Hook - Ty Dolla $ign] (x2)
I wake up in the morning
Pull them panties to the side
See me twistin' up that Cali
Cause you know I stay high
(Fuck my bitch, then count my dough) (x4)

[Verse 1 - YG]
Wake up in the morning, fuck my bitch, she fuck me back
After I nut, she clean it up, we count a stack
If you were around the corner, you could probably hear her moaning
I wake the neighbors up, because I fuck her every morning
I'm a motherfucking gangsta, got some straps up in the closet
In these streets is beef, so I keep the deuces in my pocket
Even though I'm on probation, Keep the blunt in rotation
Smoking some fire, got it from my connect, and he Jamaican
I'm just trying to make a dollar out of 15 cents
So I hit the block, and straight pimp me a bitch
My daddy told me, "Nigga, get it how you live"
So it's money over bitches, nigga that's just what it is
Keep it G till I die, to these bitches I lie
Walk up out the mall looking so fly
All I know my bank account got long ass digits
California weed, counting cheese, fucking bad bitches

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Big KRIT]
I'm talking early morning fucking, bed side sucking
While you turning on your oven, I was pullin out and busting
On her back, never in her cat, never in between
If you got a superbad bitch like mine, shawty know what I mean
I'm talking slob on my nob like a pro
Zoning, zoning, blowing, she might never let it go, on the low
She's a very freaky girl, don't say no to daddy
She get wet when I swing down, dump it in my Cadi
She built like a thoroughbred, ride like a glass house
Push on the pedal, she shake and shiver and mad shy
Breakfast of champions, Benz and ass and titties
Kush and orange juice, serving up and hella pimping

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Big Sean]
Yeah, I wake up with hard dick
And the bitch you was dreaming about
She wake up to the realest nigga
That all of these hoes is dreaming about
I walk in the bank, I'm cleaning it out
Jewelry store, I'm gleaming it out
I'm smacking these hoes, and I skeet on their blouse
You keep them at home, I'm just leasing them off
WESTSIDE! And I don't mean the fucking coast
She screaming B.I.G., but it ain't no fucking ghost
The hoes that turned you down is the ones I fuck the most
I'm burning all this bread, so we might as well fucking toast
Man these niggas looking at me like they're hoes or something
Ya'll barely touching green, ya'll are holes-in-one
These niggas is hoes and cunts
Damnit life's a slut, but I bust a nut
And it's no wonder why all these niggas look like my oldest son
It's me, Sayitaint, and that ghetto ass nigga, dealer man
Lighting purple haze, you would've thought I was chilling with Killa Cam
Going around and around and around and around
This shit is feeling like ceiling fans
I feel the hands feeling in my pants
I'm like, "Shut the fuck up, ho, and get in this van"
