[Verse 1]
Ay, I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Niggas hating but I love them even though they trying to scheme
But I'm past that, a nigga's stock is rising like the Nasdaq
They say I’m the future but yet I’m giving niggas flashbacks
Of better days when you ain't have to settle for whatever played
I represent the struggle nigga, I say what they never say
Whenever they spit that bullshit they spitting
This that pulpit, I’m hitting niggas with the gospel
Hostile with them hoes, I got a dollar in my pocket plus a dream
Yeah you laughing my nigga but everything ain't what it seems
What it means to know your momma or your father on that pipe
On that hard white, I’ll tell you what them scars like
I’m speaking through these bars like a nigga in the jail
Tired of sifting through my mail I feel like Cartwright, bills
For real, a nigga ill
Just let me do the talking man I know how niggas feel

[Hook]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems

[Verse 2]
I got a dolla and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
Every lady ain't no ho and every bitch ain't no queen
Every nigga ain't no dog and every nigga ain't no king
Shit be happening for a reason, everything is everything
Every nigga can't dunk, some white man can jump
They shooting niggas 'fore they even tell 'em put their hands up!
Crooked cops got a nigga scared to drive
Probably thinking that I’m slanging man I see it in their eyes
But inside of my pocket is a dollar plus a dream
Yeah, you swear your girl is faithful; everything ain't what it seems
See, I seen how she glance and look away like she want it
I ain't saying I'mma fuck her, but I could if I wanted
Know it hurts that she flirts with a nigga this is worse
I bet if I was to hit, man I wouldn’t be the first
This is church, this is gospel
Spit it like I get it from the Bible for your survival

[Hook]
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems
I got a dollar and a dream, real niggas on my team
Everything ain't what it seems

[Verse 3]
Check it
Ay Sallie, I know I ain't been answering your calls
But shit, let me explain- it's because times been hard
Been running around trying find a job
I hear my phone ringing in the morning, 9 o’clock
And it's you, can't even front I press ignore
I still got your letters laying in my dresser drawer
You telling me about all the things you did for me
When I was broke, you sent me dough and that was big for me
See you was there every year when I needed you
And you were so quick to give I had to be with you
Remember when I used to call you on your phone line
I knew it was official when my momma cosigned
But in no time a nigga graduated
I hit the real world, baby girl I'm sad to say it
But I was using you, you gave a nigga major stacks
And I know in my heart one day that I'm gonna pay you back”
I got a dollar and a dream
