[Intro: Big KRIT]

I'd like to a, sometimes
Excuse me for being so blunt
It's in my nature, you know

[Big KRIT]

Sometimes it rains and pours on me, thunderstorm homie
Well let it storm on me
Feel like sometimes it rains and pours on me, thunderstorm homie
Well let it storm on me
Feel like sometimes it rains and pours on me, thunderstorm homie
Well let it storm on me
Feel like a hurricane went and formed on me
I swear the teardrops of God feel so warm on me
Well drown me in no more sorrows, hopeless tomorrows
Should have died so long ago I swear my time is borrowed
But give me no shelter, no cheap umbrellas
You'd learn to cherish rain if you came to the desert
A little comfort in the heat of the devil
Rain drop freeze and form ice on my vessel
Frostbit fingertips, frozen cut necklace
No Doppler system or weather man projected this
The storm of the century, monsoon on this industry
Puddles reflect the truth I surely was meant to be
Flash floods in ass clubs, no life jackets for these rappers
On the roof of success but watch 'em pass us
Look for answers in the sky can't trust my pastor
He say whatever in the name to get my cash cause
He hurting just like me, working just like me, uncertain just like me

In The Rain
Yeah I don't like to go out in the rain
In The Rain
