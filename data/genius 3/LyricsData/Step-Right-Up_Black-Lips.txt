Step on up get it line
No admission free this time
About to see some truth at hand
In just a moment you'll understand

Maybe you missed it the first time
Didn't quite get it on the second line
Now's the last chance fore your time
Cause then it's not coming back again!

Now you want it it's what you need
And what you need you can't have
Cause it's mine, all mine
Less you kill me, free your mind

Maybe you missed it the first time
Didn't quite get it on the second line
Now's the last chance fore your time
Cause then it's not coming back again!

Now you've seen it, whatcha think?
The beautiful colors on the bathroom sink
And it's gone, all gone
Now you see it, just like King Khan
