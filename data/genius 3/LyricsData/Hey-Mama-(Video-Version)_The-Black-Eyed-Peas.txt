[Intro: Fergie]
A-La la la laa

[Hook: Will.i.am]
Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your booty mama
We the blast masters blastin' up the jamma
(Rewind)

[Bridge: Tippa Irie (x2)]
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and
Hey shawty, I know you want to party
The way your body lookin' make me really feel naughty

[Verse 1: Will.i.am]
I got a naughty naughty style and a naughty naughty crew
But everything I do, I do just for you
I'm a little bit of Old, and a bigger bit of New
The true niggas know that the peas come thru
We never cease, we never die no we never decease
We multiply like we mathamatics
And then we drop bombs like we in the middle east
The bomb bombas, the base move dramas

[Pre-Hook: Will.i.am]
Naw y'all know, who we are
Y'all knaw, we the stars
Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevards
And, lookin' hard without bodyguards
I do what I can
(W)ill.i.am
And still I stand, with still mic in hand
So come on mama, dance to the drama

[Hook: All]
Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your booty mama
We the blast masters blastin' up the jamma
So shake your bum bumma, come on now mama
This that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your booty mama
We the blast masters
Blastin' up the jamma
A-La la la laa

[Verse 2: Will.i.am]
We the big town stumpas, and and big sound pumpas
The beat bump bumpas all in your trunk trunkas
The girlies in the club got tha plump plump plumpas
And when I'm makin' love, my hip hump humps
It never quits we need to carry 9mm clips
Dont wanna squize trigger, just wanna squeeze tits
Lubaluba 'cause we the show stoppas
And the chief rockas, number one chief rockas

[Pre-Hook 2: Will.i.am & (Fergie)]
Now y'all know, (who we are)
Y'all know, (we the stars)
(Steady rockin' on y'alls boulevard)​
How we rockin' it girl, (without bodyguards)​
She be (Fergie)​
From the crew (BEP)
(Come and take heed, as we take the lead)
(so come on bubba, dance to the drum a)

[Hook: All]
Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your booty mama
We the blast masters blastin' up the jamma
So shake your bum bumma, come on now mama
This that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your booty mama
We the blast masters
Blastin' up the jamma

[Bridge: Tippa Irie]
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty

The way your body lookin' make me really feel naughty
Cutie cutie, make sure you move your booty
Shake that thing like we in the city of sin, and

[Fergie]
No fakin, I know you see me shakin'
And the way I break it down I got the whole world quakin
Off the Richter, [x6]
Steady, are you ready

[Verse 3: Apl De Ap & Taboo]
We're the BEP crew and the beebop breakers
The boom bap maker and the party heavyweighters
We break it on down for the mamas with the shakers
Come on, do it, do it, come on, do it
We are the soulful invader, the mind stimulator
Tunes for the DJs who switch the cross fader
So get on the floor and move your body
Are y'all ready to party

[Hook: All]
Hey mama, this that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your booty mama
We the blast masters blastin' up the jamma
So shake your bum bumma, come on now mama
This that shit that make you groove, mama
Get on the flow and move your booty mama
We the blast masters
Blastin' up the jamma
A-La la la laa
