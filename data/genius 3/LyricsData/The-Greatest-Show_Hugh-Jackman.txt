[Intro: Ensemble]
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah

[Verse 1: P.T. Barnum]
Ladies and gents, this is the moment you've waited for (woah)
Been searching in the dark, your sweat soaking through the floor (woah)
And buried in your bones there's an ache that you can't ignore
Taking your breath, stealing your mind
And all that was real is left behind

[Pre-Chorus: P.T. Barnum]
Don't fight it, it's coming for you, running at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
Your fever dream, can't you see it getting closer
Just surrender 'cause you feel the feeling taking over
It's fire, it's freedom, it's flooding open
It's a preacher in the pulpit and you'll find devotion
There's something breaking at the brick of every wall it's holding All that you know, so tell me do you wanna go?

[Chorus: Ensemble & P.T. Barnum]
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are running the night
Impossible comes true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watching it come true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

[Verse 2: P.T. Barnum]
(Woah) colossal we come these renegades in the ring
(Woah) where the lost get found in the crown of the circus king

[Pre-Chorus: Ensemble & P.T. Barnum]
Don't fight it, it's coming for you, running at ya
It's only this moment, don't care what comes after
It's blinding outside and I think that you know
Just surrender 'cause you're calling and you wanna go

[Chorus: Ensemble & P.T. Barnum]
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are running the night
Impossible comes true, intoxicating you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watching it come true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

[Post-Chorus: P.T. Barnum & Lettie Lutz]
It's everything you ever want
It's everything you ever need
And it's here right in front of you
This is where you wanna be (This is where you wanna be)
It's everything you ever want
It's everything you ever need
And it's here right in front of you
This is where you wanna be
This is where you wanna be

[Chorus: Ensemble, Phillip Carlyle, Lettie Lutz & P.T. Barnum]
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are running the night
Impossible comes true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the sun can't stop us now
Watching it come true, it's taking over you
This is the greatest show
Where it's covered in all the colored lights
Where the runaways are running the night
Impossible comes true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show
We light it up, we won't come down
And the walls can't stop us now
I'm watching it come true, it's taking over you
Oh, this is the greatest show

[Bridge: Phillip Carlyle & Anne Wheeler]
'Cause everything you want is right in front of you
And you see the impossible is coming true
And the walls can't stop us (now) now, yeah

[Outro]
This is the greatest show (Oh!)
This is the greatest show (Oh!)
This is the greatest show (Oh!)
This is the greatest show (Oh!)
This is the greatest show (Oh!)
This is the greatest show (Oh!)
(This is the greatest show)
This is the greatest show (Oh!)
This is the greatest show!
