The Star Room:
[Intro]
Hallelujah, thank God I have a future
Prayin’ I don’t waste it gettin’ faded
Cause I’m smoking… till I’m coughin’ up tar
Through the surge, energy curve like a lumbar
I don’t act hard, I still read Babar
Trippin’ out, lookin’ at a bunch of Google map stars, shit
They got a app for… that

[Verse 1]
But me, I’m still trapped inside my head, it kinda feel like it’s a purgatory
So polite and white, but I got family who would murder for me
Think I’m living paradise, so would I have to worry ’bout?
Dealing with these demons, feel the pressure, find the perfect style
Making sure my mom and dad are still somewhat in love
All these backfires of my experiments with drugs
And I experience the touch of my epiphany in color form
The difference between love and war inform me – I’m above the norm
But, give me anybody though
I’ll gladly chew his face off, them bath salts
Rhyming like it’s summertime on asphalt, hot
Haven’t picked a major label, think I’m blackballed
I still don’t got the heart to pick my phone up when my dad calls
Will he recognize his son when he hears my voice?
I put this music against my life, I think I fear the choice
And I don’t know what I’m running from, but I’m running still
I conversate with acquaintances, but it’s nothing real
I’m from a city that you hear and think a bunch of steel
So a hundred mills wouldn’t make me sign a fucking deal
Money kills, that’s the truth, it’s called the root of evil
But I want that Rolls Royce that the homie Lennon drove
So, if you ain’t talkin’ bout some money I’mma send you home
Unconventional, special but unprofessional
Adolescent expression that’s letting me meet these centerfolds
As troubles fill my mind capacity, I let them go
If I was Johnny Depp in Blow, I would let it snow
That’s just me all wilding out and being extra, though

[Verse 2]
And if God was a human it’d be yours truly
Watching horror movies with some foreign groupies
Thinking this decor suits me
I do drugs to get more loopy
I’m in tune to ancient jujitsu spirituals it’s blissful
Looking out as far as eyes can see
I’m glad that me and this elevation could finally meet
I think I’m JFK’s final speech
They try assassinating all of my beliefs
But I’m asleep so whisper to me for some peace of mind
And he be high some weed to grind on top a Jesus shrine
Twenty thousand on my watch cause I needed time
If y’all would leave me the fuck alone, that’d be divine
Can’t decide if you like all the fame
Three years ago to now, it’s just not the same
I’m looking my window ashing on the pane
Shit, wonder if I lost my way
[Outro]
Don’t you ever wanna hide away
Poseidon triumph in the eyes of rain
Won’t give a fuck about tomorrow if I die today
I’ll greet the devil with a smilin’ face
Shit, that God fellow may reside in space
As, time’s a wasting I’m freebasing with Freemasons
My girl’s switchin’ the locks, the keys keep changin’
Dreamin’ of places my own personal creations
If there’s a party in heaven I plan to leave wasted
Retracin’ my steps way back to biblical times
We-We all gon’ end up meetin’ at the finishin’ line

Killin’ Time:

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
I’m posing a question
How many been empty and holding aggression?
Close to depression, open your eyes and just focus a second
Fucking recession
My brother my mind’s always moving I’m letting it go
Know that I’m pointing at negative energy, telling me stop
They’re telling me no, don’t
Your aura is something you ain’t even sure of
Explore the core of California, hoes got more to snort up
I’ve had a smorgasbord pornographic thought
That’s a lot, the feeling come after the shock
Praise me I’d rather you not, cause
It’s driving me crazy
The fact that you pay to make me into something I love
You come to the club searching for drugs, drunk
Fucking these sluts
God loves me, what if he does, what does it mean?
You’re wasting away doing nothing, you’re fronting
Why ain’t you chasing your dreams?
We wonder ’bout life but none of us willing to learn
The money we earn is something to burn
Why won’t they give me a turn–out?
Feed the hungry and clothe the naked
You’re mistaken the world is cold and it’s lonely ain’t it
When ‘em high roller homes in Vegas
Raid them with some home invasions
Contaminating the place with plague, we just saved the day
I waste away in a room spitting these raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands and I’m giving it back

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Forfeit in the war, he lays a sword down and walks away
Grabs a 40 from the corner store and begins to contemplate
Dealing with death like you work in the morgue observing the souls
Forgotten, he lost his way
Starring down that barrel, thinking not today
Life’s so precious, Lord knows life is so precious
Fight to the death,til’ there’s nobody left
You’re holding your breath because you might get infected
I’m animalistic, instinctively thinking I’m going ballistic
Be specific, to those who in control we all statistics
Misogynistic with a twisted mind, I’m intertwined
My trigger finger itching, all I kill is time
Initial symptoms is schizophrenic behavior
The mind is like religion, can’t agree on who’s its savior
The newest flavor of superhero, I’m shooting lasers
Except I’m cool with Vader
And blowing up rooms that’s full of strangers
A news anchor, the youth can relate to, it’s nature
If you’re a hater, I’ll deal with you later,no thank you
I’m just your neighbor, please don’t do me no favors
Really doe, come on homie we major
I waste away in this room spitting out raps
Yahweh put the world in my hands and I’m giving it back…
