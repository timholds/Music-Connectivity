You are the sunshine of my life
That's why i'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

I feel like this is the beginning
Though i've loved you for a million years
And if i thought our love was ending
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why i'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye
Forever you'll stay in my heart

(you must have known that i was lonely
Because you came to my rescue . . .)
And i know that this must be heaven
How could so much love be inside of you?

You are the sunshine of my life
That's why i'll always be around
You are the apple of my eye . . 

You! . . . (you, you!) i said you are (you are!)
You are the sun! (you are the sun!)
You are the sunshine! (you are the sunshine!)
You are the sun . . . shine . . . of . . 
My life!
