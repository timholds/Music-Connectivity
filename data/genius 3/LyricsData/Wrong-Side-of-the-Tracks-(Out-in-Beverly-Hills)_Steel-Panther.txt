[Verse 1]
My mansion is the size of a city block
I got a statue of David but he's missin' his cock
I got my name monogrammed on the side of my jet
But I can't afford a hangar to park the thing yet

[Chorus]
Tell me how is a guy to live
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills

[Verse 2]
I got a 20 year old wife and she's eager to please
But she made me throw away my Dokken CD's
I got surround sound runnin' through the whole damn house
And some Dokken's getting cranked
Just as soon as I figure the bluetooth out!

[Chorus]
Tell me how is a guy to live
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills

[Bridge]
And every night
There's Hollywood just beckoning from my neighborhood
Transvestites under street lights, looking so tight
Think I just might

[Verse 3]
I got a Filipino lover with a southern drawl
I can only sleep at night using Propofol
You can take a boy out of the trailer park, you see
But ya never gonna get the trailer out of me, no
It's the only way I live

[Chorus]
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
(On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills)
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
(On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills)
On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills
(On the wrong side of the tracks out in Beverly Hills)
