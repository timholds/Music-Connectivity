[Intro]
An unforeseen future nestled somewhere in time
Unsuspecting victims no warnings no signs
Judgment day the second coming arrives
Before you see the light you must die

[Verse 1]
Forgotten children conform a new faith
Avidity and lust controlled by hate
The never ending search for your shattered sanity
Souls of damnation in their own reality

[Pre-Chorus]
Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

[Verse 2]
Bastard sons begat your cunting daughters
Promiscuous mothers with incestuous fathers
Ingrate souls condemned for all eternity
Obtained by immoral observance a domineering deity

[Pre-Chorus]
Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive sabbath

[Chorus]
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven

(Lead - King)

The root of all evil is the heart of a black soul
A force that has lived all eternity
The never ending search for a truth never told
The loss of all hope and your dignity

Chaos rampant
An age of distrust
Confrontations
Impulsive habitat

On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven
On and on south of heaven

(Lead - Hanneman)
