If I was a white horse...an offered you a ride...
Thru a black forest

If we took a strange course...promised you a danger...
For a while

Ooh-ooh (..a white horse)...Lorelei
Ooh-ooh (..a white horse)...Lorelei

There's no way 'round the forest...the only way is thru
An' there's no way I'll ever make it on my own..without you

But if you are persuaded...by all those dragonflies offering you a ride...
I'll know why

Ooh-ooh (..a white horse)...Lorelei
Ooh-ooh (..a white horse)...I'll know why
I'll know why

Forests come in all size...danger many shapes...
Well who's to say

If I was a white horse...offered you a ride...
Thru a black forest
