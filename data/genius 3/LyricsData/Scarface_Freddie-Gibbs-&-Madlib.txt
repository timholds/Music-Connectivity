Blood gushing, I think I hear sirens

[Verse 1]
Chiefing on that, think I hear my heart beat
Smoking, got me rolling stogies on a dark street
Let's jack this nigga cause he got some shit we can't afford
Another day in Gary, 'nother couple niggas in the morgue
He got the beating, his weed crumbs on plush seats
Niggas wanna hate, they get yellow tape'd and white sheets
And he steady talking, my chopper, he gonna let it rip
All the bullets that got my name on 'em still in the clip
Life's a bitch, I was a virgin, hope she let me fuck
Pray I miss before a nigga bust his last nut
Homie '84 got the same rims that mine had
Freddie jumped up in it like freshman year with the dime bags
I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Pulling stick ups to the nigga from a no-name
Diamond bezel, went from pebbles to a whole thing
Now them punk detectives in my section know my whole name
Gibbs, nigga
