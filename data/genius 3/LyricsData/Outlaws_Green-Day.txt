[Verse 1]
Life after youth
Faded in twilight
The dawn of a criminal in bloom
First love
First forgiveness
We were delinquents
Freaks of a faded memory

[Chorus 1]
Outlaws, When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption
Baby Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
The outlaws of forever

[Verse 2]
Scars, broken hearts
Breaking in cars
Running in the light of the moon
Lost souls
Bottle rockets
All that we wanted
Is for a life beyond the stars

[Chorus 1]
Outlaws, When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption
Baby Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of forever, baby

[Bridge]
I got no supervision
Nothing will change my spirits
Race around with my innocence
I'll plead my innocence
But that's my best defense
When you are young

[Chorus 2]
Outlaws, When we were forever young
When we were outlaws
We're outlaws of redemption
Baby Hooligans
We destroyed suburbia
When we were outlaws
The outlaws of forever

[Outro]
I found a knife by the railroad track
You took a train and you can't go back
Forever now
Forever now, you'll roam
