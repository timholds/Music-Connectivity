[Verse 1]
All this love, is all I am
A ball is all I am
I'm so new compared to you
And I am very small

[Chorus]
Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
I will see the sunshine show

[Verse 2]
All around I hear strange sounds
Come drifting round my ears
Dark the light and long the night
I feel my dawn is near

[Chorus]
Warm glow, moon gloom
Always need a little more room
Waiting here seems like years
I will see the sunshine show

[6 minute guitar outro]
