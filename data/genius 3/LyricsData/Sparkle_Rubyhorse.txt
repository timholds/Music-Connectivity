Through the clouds
A nice surprise
To see that twinkle returing to your eyes
I've searched my head
For some old spark
We fell around this place
Stumbling in the dark

And when I feel the skies will never clear
You remind me spring is near

How you sparkle
How you shine
How you rise above the sky
And you rise, and you rise

Through the crowd
I catch your eye
Takes me back again
When we were getting high

I've searched my head
For some old spark
Fell around this place
Fumbling in the dark

And when I feel the skies will never clear
You remind me spring is near

How you sparkle
How you shine
How you rise above the sky
And you rise, and you rise

Nothing in this world
Could make me love you less
Shadows often leave perfection in a mess

Oh my love, Oh my Lord
Oh my love, Oh my Lord

How you sparkle
How you shine
How you rise above the sky
How you sparkle
How you shine
How you rise above the sky
And you rise, And you rise...
