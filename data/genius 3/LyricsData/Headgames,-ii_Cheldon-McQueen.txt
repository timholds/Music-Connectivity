[Verse 1]
All a nigga really need is a lil' bit
Little bit of this
Little bit of that that
Take a little bit you
When you
Throw a little bit back
When you all in my zone
Gimme that funk
That sweet, that gushy stuff been plaguing my mind
All in my mind
All in my thoughts, it fuck with my art
Got mona lisa in my bimmer rocking gold and adidas say she only fuck with niggas with some goals and achievements, I guess
I got a kiss on my list like hall and oates
You bad as what?
Girl I know
Stoney eyed woman out the stoney brook
Trying to steal your boney heart, I can't be the only crook
Only if I only tried, told her look me in my eyes, this may come as some surprise but


[Verse 2]
It's eight grade with the taper fade
You were on your halle berry with the finger waves
Only if she was as bad as that man, she would be able to keep a black man
Yeah I got jokes don't I
But neither of us laughed when I moved to san antoni
When I thought that crown victoria was a continental
Exchanging folded letters thinking we was confidential
Purp and patron, I lean on purple patron, that day I asked you your name I smiled until I got home
I said
I think she like me
Oh I think she like me
She like me she write me letters is this that forever forever?
I can't even do my class work
This dames the name to all my passwords
And we can live our whole life together everything right together
I just gotta ask first
