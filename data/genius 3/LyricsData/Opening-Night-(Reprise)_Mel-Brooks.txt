[USHERETTES]
Opening night, it's opening night

It's Max Bialystock's latest show
Will it flop or will it go?

The house lights are dimming
The footlights are bright
The toast of society's burning tonight

We're so excited
We can't sit down
Cause Springtime for Hilter has come to town!

[MAX and LEO enter from one side of the stage, and ROGER, CARMEN, and FRANZ enter from the other.]

[ROGER]
Ah, it's Bialystock and Bloom. Well, gentlemen ... merde!

[CARMEN]
Toi, toi, toi
