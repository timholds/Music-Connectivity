[Verse 1]
When I'm in a car at night with you
I feel like we're made of stone
Paternity tests and bulletproof vests
I think these cops will kill you
Well, there's nothing to do in this town
Nothing to do but drive around
Well, there's no destination, no place to go
Hanging out, driving 'round the same old groove
Gotta get these up the street, gotta neighbor whose pissed
We could have a nuclear war struck

[Chorus]
When I'm in a car, when I'm in a car
When I'm in a car, when I'm in a car

[Verse 2]
When I'm in a car at night with you
I feel like we're made of sound
All my friends are bullets since
We're just hanging around
Well, there's no fascination, nothing to bowl
Hanging out, driving 'round the same old groove
No fascination, nothing to bowl
(?)

[Chorus]
When I'm in a car, when I'm in a car
When I'm in a car, when I'm in a car
