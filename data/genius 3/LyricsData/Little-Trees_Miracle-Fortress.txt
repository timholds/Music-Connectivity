Basing everything I say on the red read words you've been...

Sending my way

At the end of each day I'll have lent you a phrase that I've read to...

Regret 'til I'm red in the face

I won't ask for a cure

Not for a verse

Not for a glimpse from the Heavens of Earth

Or the worst of punishments meant for me first

Or the reasons I've been here for seasons and turns

Chasing history round with the birds

For the secrets in sounds and the weeping of work

And I'll learn ofa the waiting release

Or of him the releaser

Commander in chief

And police of the purified and of the beasts

So what else?

And beyond and beyond and beyond

Being bonded to flesh

To lessons

Questions and tests

We might see what's left and what's leaving it's weight

I won't ask for a cure

Not for a verse

Not for a glimpse from the Heavens of Earth

Or the worst of punishments meant for me first

Or the reasons I've been here for seasons and turns

Chasing history round with the birds

For the secrets in sounds and the weeping of work

Deep beneath the ocean waves

There is a whale or two

As big as you might ever be as small

But the wails that a boy brings home

Can be as big as the sea

Little trees

Or any ocean breeze

Don't make me have to choose which side

There ain't no side to take if you're wide awake and free

Awake and free

High above the mountain range

There is a gull or three

As big as me

Maybe twice as strong

If I tried to sing 'em this old thing

They would sing to me a tweedle dee

Or in so many words

They can fly about as high as i could ever try

To never die

Or wonder why I do
