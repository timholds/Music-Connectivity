[Video Intro]
How do you say, Deee-Groovy?
How do you say, Deee-Gorge?
Ooh la la, la - lalalala la
[Scatting]
How do you say Deee-Lite?
(Deee-Lite, Deee-Lite, Deee-Lite)

[Intro]
(We're going to dance and have some fun)
(Dig!)

[Verse 1: Lady Miss Kier]
The chills that you spill up my back keep me filled
With satisfaction when we're done
Satisfaction of what's to come
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another (You know that's right)
Your groove I do deeply dig
No walls, only the bridge
My supper dish, my succotash wish (Sing it, baby)
I couldn't ask for another (Uh huh, uh huh)
No, I couldn't ask for another

[Chorus: Lady Miss Kier]
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
(Watch out)

[Verse 2: Lady Miss Kier]
The depth of hula groove
Moves into the tenth hoop
We're gonna groove to Horton Hears a Who-who
I couldn't ask for another
No, I couldn't ask for another
DJ Soul was on a roll
I've been told he can't be sold
He's not vicious or malicious
Just de-lovely and delicious
I couldn't ask for another

[Verse 3: Q-Tip]
Unh, some looks in this torso
Hot, got a deal, you wanna know?
The live of truely delightful
Makin' it, doin' it, 'specially at a show
Feelin' kinda high like a Hendrix haze
Music makes motion, moves like a maze
All inside of me, heart especially
Note of the rhythm, where I wanna be
Flowin', glowin', electric eyes
You dip to the dive, baby yo, realize
When will you see the funky side of me?
Baby, you'll see that rhythm is the key
Get, get, wit' it, wit' it
Can't think, quit it, quit it
Stomp on the streets when I hear a funk beat
Playin' pop like follow hoods true
Baby, just sing about the groove
(sing it)

[Chorus: Lady Miss Kier]
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
(One, two, three)

[Bridge: Q-Tip]
Blow them horns along
(The groove is in your heart)

[Chorus: Lady Miss Kier]
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
Groove is in the heart
