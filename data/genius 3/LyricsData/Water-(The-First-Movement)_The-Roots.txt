[Black Thought]
South Philly, North Side
Oakland, Texas
Georgia, Black People
Yo, worldwide, this is for my my niggas
You know what I'm saying
Dumb and blind...

[Verse One: Black Thought]
They say a record ain't nothing if it's not touching
Gripping, draw you in closer make you want to listen to it
And if you real ill at making music
The listener feel like he livin' through it
That's how my nigga do it
I met Slacks back at Lyte, '91, rapping
We went to Millersville to get away from gun clappin'
It ain't last
I be in class dreaming 'bout
50,000 fans up in the stands screaming out
Encore, yo I'm headed back to Philly
Nigga you rollin' with me?
I'm trying to get busy
We walked dogs that was off the chain
Lot of times at the shows people hardly came
I just took it in stride as part of the game
But inside people down with me started to change
It was a couple things, lil' syrup, lil' pills
Instead of riding out on the road you'd rather chill
I know the way a pleasure feel
I'm not judging
But still I'm on a mission, yo I'm not buggin'
I got fam that can't stop druggin', they can't sleep
They can't stick to one subject, they can't eat
It's people steady comin' at me out in the street
Like 'Riq, yo, what up with your peeps, it gets deep nigga

[Hook]
Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high
Son you missin' out on was passing you by
I done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry
But not you and I my nigga
We got to get
Come on, over over the water
Come on, over over the water
Water, Water...

[Verse Two: Black Thought]
Yo, we done been through many meals, a couple of deals
We done shared clothes and wheels, killed mics and reels
We done rocked shows abroad and slept on floors
Trying to figure what the fuck we gettin' slept on for
Or what we walking with the weap-on for
Weighted by the gravity law, you know it if you came up poor, my nigga
Picture the bus up north
You know we made of everything outlaws are made of
I'm far from a hater
And I don't say I love you 'cause the way I feel is greater
And M-Ila, you a poet, son, you a born creator
And this'll probably dawn on you later, it's in your nature
Lyrics all on your walls like they made of paper
You got to find out where your talent take you
You might fuck around, finally make it
And that's real but yo

[Hook]
Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high
Son you missin' out on was passing you by
I done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry
But not you and I my nigga
We got to get
Come on, over over the water
Come on, over over the water
Water, Water...

[Verse Three: Black Thought]
Yo, I want you all to understand I come from South Philly
And when I walk the street it's like a pharmacy
They got all type of shit anybody could get
It goes from H to X to loosie cigarette
For my ghetto legend known for lil' sheist runnin'
Copped codeine by the quarts and keep comin'
Dumbin, just embracing the dope like it's a woman
You burnin' both sides of the rope and just pullin'
Tuggin', in between Islam and straight thuggin'
Laying everyday around the way and doin' nothin'
See'em looking shaking their head and start shruggin'
If they don't got a man like mine, they got a cousin
Hey yo you better be a true friend to 'em
Before the shit put an end to 'em
Or give a pen to 'em
Or lock 'em up in the studio with a mic
'Cause on the real it might save his life
Keep tellin' 'em

[Hook 2X]
Yo, you need to walk straight, master your high
Son you missin' out on was passing you by
I done seen the streets suck a lot of cats dry
But not you and I my nigga
We got to get
Come on, over over the water
Come on, over over the water
Water, Water...
