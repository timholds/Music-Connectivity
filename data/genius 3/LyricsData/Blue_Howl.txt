[Verse 1]
Oh
Can you feel it in the rhythm
Does it make you wanna move
Just a Friday, it's the weekend and Monday is just old news
I'm a sucker for some leather you put on with that suit
And I won't let the telly make me feel

[Refrain]
Blue, oh
Blue, oh

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm a loser and a drinker
A loser just like you
So let's get together and think up something new
Move to Berlin, bump the Techno and dance amongst the stars
You're a raver, I'm a taker
We don't feel

[Refrain]
Blue, oh
Blue, oh
Blue, oh
Blue, oh

[Verse 3]
Don't get no comedown and just chill out
Just live a little too
'Till the sun's up and it's late out, ain't got nowhere to be
You're law is our motto
Let's live in fantasy
And I won't let anybody make me feel

[Refrain]
Blue, oh
Blue, oh
Blue, oh
Blue, oh
Blue, oh
Blue, oh
Blue, oh
Oh, Oh, Oh
