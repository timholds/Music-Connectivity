Snowflake in a hot world
Don't let them get to you
Don't let them tell you
You're all the same

Snowflake in a hot world
Light inside the dark
You lonely little spark
Too frozen to feel
So fleeting and so real

Melting into something... bigger than you
Melting into someone... someone new

Snowflake in a hot world
Look around you
At all you've done
And all you've become
You're where you should be
You're where you should be
You're where you should be

Melting into something... bigger than you
Melting into someone... someone new

Snowflake in a hot world
Don't let them get to you
Don't let them tell you
You're all the same
You're not all the same
You're where you should be
You're where you should be
Nothing to hold on to
And it's a long way... down

Floating, drifting, changing... shifting
