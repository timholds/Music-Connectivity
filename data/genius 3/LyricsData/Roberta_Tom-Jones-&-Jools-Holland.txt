I ain't mad at you
Don't you be mad at me
I ain't mad at you
So don't you be mad at me
One and one is two
Two and one is three
I wanna find my baby going away downtown
I wanna find my baby going away downtown
If I can't find Roberta
Going to jump overboard and drown
Oh, I said I ain't mad at you Don't you be mad at me
I ain't mad at you, child
Don't you be mad at me
One and one is two
Two and one is three
Come on baby
Going to pawn my whistle
Pawn my watch and chain
Going to pawn my whistle
Pawn my watch and chain
If I can't find Roberta
I'll hand over all my pay
Oh, I said, I ain't mad at you
Don't you be mad at me
I ain't mad at you
Don't you be mad at me
One and one is two
Two and one is three
