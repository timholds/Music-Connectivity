[Intro: Mikill Pane]
I hope you hear this
This is art for the fearless
And if you have a car
I hope you don't even have an R on your gearstick
I hope you kids are all stuck in drive
Hurdling towards happiness in this otherwise
Miserable fucking life
You can always do better
A wise man told me that it ain't something that I couldn't forget
And if you were born in the ghetto
Don't let anyone tell you that that's as good as it gets
To all my orphans in the making
Keep your pen game hotter than August in midday
Until it's a scorch to your creating
You can earn your shit
Live in a big house and push German whips
Make your Mercs turn heads while you burn the strip
You're a clever lot
The only words you have to remember is
Movement never stops

[Verse 1: Scorcher]
They better know
We're never in at no long ting
They better know
Money on the phone when it rings
They better know
Cats on the line
Want it in the nose with the sniff
Little bit of crow in the cling
Dem man are moist
Niggas better know what it is
Brothers better know what I'm on
Huddle up, poke it and gone
Now little man open the sleeve

[Verse 2: Ghetts]
Rambo in the jungle
Mad clothes in a bundle
White ting with some long hair
Man know its Rupunzel
Cuh' man know when I come through
Couple man fold and fumble
A man spoke and stumbled
I'm so old school man are no lickle man
But man ah man know mans on

[Verse 3: Scorcher]
Them little niggas don't know me
But them man tryna compete
I'm tryna sound better than the old me
Then get on a train, get off at bolmey
It's six bills for a stoney
My ting criss yeah a trophy
A ting thick like a pony
You want bits you can phone me
You niggas are little niggas, I'ma OG
I'm feeling like the 05 when I flow Me

[Verse 4: Mercston]
Black nokia ringing a manz coming here with it
Bag it and seal it, I made a killing
You can get a picture, no camera with it
I'll do it for the gram
Do it for my nan in a council flat
Yo, I never had a wet amedas
Yo, hot boy on the fan with that
Active, never been in a standard [?]
Pop stuff from when I was living inside the land

[Verse 5: Ghetts]

Nino, New jack
Juiced, 2Pac
Eastside, New Hamp
Don't say you knew man 'cause I'm a new man
Jme, Do rag
Wheels spinning
Two one, Too gassed
(Bludcart) Poster boy without the blue tack
They can't eat where I eat with them food stamps
The wife got me on a obo
If I sleep with a freak, I'm a douchebag
I can't even give the gram a little follow
Even if I never beat, she assumes that
Blue I ain't going home tomorrow

[Verse 6: Mercston]
Got a gal next door, I'm having my own party
Yeah, I can buy what I want but you see me in a Smarty
You gotta watch G
Tell him I spent more on my bang wiz carty
The way I'm cutting down these trees
Man'll think I'm out here shottin barley
I tell a girl I ain't linking up
But you, me and her we can orgy

[Verse 7: Ghetts]
Poster boy darky

Then I'ma take boys darling

[Verse 8: Scorcher]
I take the friend with it
I never came but I left with it
Yeah, I worked brain on it, got brain from it, came on it
Done the legs a next ting

[Verse 9: Mercston]
These times I was still in the dance
VIP so she give me the pass
Manz girl but she feeling me hard
I was looking to part
The magnum Don Peri was still in her glass
Snapchat a gwan
Put the camera on a dawg
Tell her how do they feel
Jus gimme the light
Buss another bottle of that
Just give me the eye when you're ready to come out this bludclart
Depart out the back, gwarn then with that
Tell you friends gwarn in the cab
[?]
Going out to all of the clubs
None of them boy ain't sparring wit us
So no, no, no
Davinche Crew going in the polo
Yeah, yeah
Sometimes out with the mandem but
More time man are solo

[Verse 10: Scorcher & Ghetts]
Red carpet beyond there
Red carpet and beyond there
Rapunzel with the long hair
They say a black man ends up with a white girl as soon as he's gone clear
And man have been that
36 in a bin bag
Shit man, come on I'm sinbad
And man have been bad
Since skinny sort times still baddin' up gym man
Now I got a little weight on me
White man pump too
You ain't gotta wait on me
New year new trim I got the fade on me
High top, blade but no blade on me
More shower than anyone trynna rain on me
I'm with Ghetts but probably got the cain on me
Them girl are like "hey stranger, hey big head"
I'm like fuck that, you should have stayed on me

[Outro: Sam Sure]
It's like venus
'Cause the streets keep the heat on us
It's between us
Stay with the believers
Swear down, don't lie
Don't blink, by eyes
No drink these days
You are, ask why
Are you asking why?
It's like venus
'Cause the streets keep the heat on us
It's between us
Stay with the believers
It's like venus
We be hot like venus
It's like venus
We be hot like venus
It's like venus
We be hot like venus
