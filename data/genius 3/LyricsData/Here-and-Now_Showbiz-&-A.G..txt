We ain't ready to be good, or ready to play fair
You ready for the Show and A experience, say "yeah"
It's so clear, it's no fair
Preem here, A here, Show here
We ain't going nowhere
But they can make you disappear with one clap
And I wanna see David Blaine make the body come back
Face on the wall, no need for thumbtacks
They show love till your candles melt away, you want that?
But on the real, I wasn't born to fail
I was born to fall and get back up
Wasn't born to kill
At times I feel like I'm not born at all
I wasn't born to deal and get wrapped up
Live through my rhymes so I get rapped up
With these wolves on my side, you gonna kidnap what?
Running with cheetahs, raised with hyenas
Pen is illmatic like my homie from Queensbridge
Think like a genius, walk like I'm Jesus
But times I'm so dumb, think with my penis
But you can't fault us, that's how we brought up
Those the ones we call sluts, take 'em on the tour bus
Chicks will get you caught up, gagged and taped
Dragged by dudes with mask and (?)
I was caged in the land of the lost
Where they quick to nail your hand to a cross
Ain't a killer but it's in me
The four-fifth blow and make ya windy
The vest means yours won't make it in me
You don't want it fam, turn me to a running man
Not like Randall Cunningham, more like the Son of Sam
The last of the slaves like Booker T
Moms said I'm special, I believed her, now look at me
So ghetto, so hood, so good, we great
And if you don't think we the truth, son, I can't relate
