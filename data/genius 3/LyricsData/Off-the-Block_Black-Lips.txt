[Verse 1]
Space salvation
Allegation
Feel the sun's
Radiation
Death tolls forming
Under oceans
Neptune's calling
In slow motion
In slow motion

[Chorus]
But you never get off the block (oh no)
But you never get off the block (oh no)
But you never get off the block
But you never get off the block

[Verse 2]
Painted faces
Being places
All the people are all famous
Band is coming
Seven years running
Legal body
Will he find it
Will he find it

[Chorus]
