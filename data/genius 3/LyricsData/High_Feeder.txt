[Instrumental]

Guess im stuck in a dream
Surrounded by coloured leaves on the ground
As i stare at the trees
I see one fall down on my hand
As i start to explore
I can't ignore a man
He turn his head around
His face was all worn by the sun

[Chorus]
Im going out for a while
So i can get high with my friends
I will
I'm going out for a while
Don't wait up cause i won't be home
Today

Drifting down the road
Losing myself in a dream
Feel my hands getting cold
Sat in a boat on a lake

[Chorus]
Im going out for a while
So i can get high with my friends
I will
I'm going out for a while
Don't wait up cause i won't be home
Today
Today

Climbing up, trying my best, as i sink

Lying back on the floor
Reaching up high into space
See myself in a glass
I'm counting the lines on my face
Again
Counting the lines on my face

[Chorus]
Im going out for a while
So i can get high with my friends
I will
I'm going out for a while
Don't wait up cause i won't be home
Today

[Chorus]
Im going out for a while
So i can get high with my friends
I'm going out for a while
Don't wait up cause i won't be home
Today
