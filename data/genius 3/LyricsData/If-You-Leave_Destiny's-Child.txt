[Chorus 1: Destiny's Child]
If you leave her, I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away, to another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me

[Verse: Beyoncé & Destiny's Child]
He wouldn't give me no explanation
'Cause he knows when I pack my bags
It ain't for no vacation, so
I'm gonna do my thang
I'm leavin' his ass alone (Oh, I'm gone; Oh, I'm movin' on my way)
He's history, too late (he's history)
The game is over
He'll see a girl's gotta do what she's gotta do

[Chorus 1: Destiny's Child]
If you leave her, I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away, to another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me
If you leave her, I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away, to another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me

[Verse: R.L. & Next]
I called 612-555-2422 to find you
I packed my bags, gassed up the Jag
And I told my dad
You're the finest girl I never had
And so, my lady
What's the message? Page me
I know it might sound crazy
But say you'll be my baby
She crushed my new Benz
Slept with my best friend
Spent all my ends
It's got to end

[Verse: Beyoncé, Destiny's Child, R.L., and Next]
Ooh, how do I know you won't hurt me like he has?
(I know I'm afraid he'll want me back)
You've gotta have faith in me
(You know I do) I'd never play ya, babe
'Cause my love is all right ('Cause my love is all you'll ever need)
'Cause I need someone for me
This love was meant to be
It's our destiny

[Beyonce & R.L.]
Just run away with me, oh ho

[Chorus 2: Next]
If you leave him, I'll leave her
Let's pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me

[Chorus 1: Destiny's Child]
If you leave her, I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away, to another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me

[Chorus 2: Next]
If you leave him, I'll leave her
Let's pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me

[Chorus 1: Destiny's Child]
If you leave her, I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away, to another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me

[Chorus 2: Next]
If you leave him, I'll leave her
Let's pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me

[Chorus 1: Destiny's Child]
If you leave her, I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away, to another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me

[Chorus 2: Next]
If you leave him, I'll leave her
Let's pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away
To another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me

[Chorus 1: Destiny's Child]
If you leave her, I'll leave him
We'll pack our bags
Don't say a word
Let's go far away, to another place
Let's hide away
Oh, just you and me
