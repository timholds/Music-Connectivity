CHORUS
First signs of the hymen, birth of the sirens
I have banished the "Hallihi"* from my own paradise
In the beginning was the big-bang
Then the unknown, a bit of chaos, the ying and the yang
There was only you, there was only me
I was Adam, you were Eve, or vice versa
Between you and me
It all began with a long kiss
Yes, that we know - that it all started with a
Big shout of joy
What I love is the beginning
Not the end, the end
CHORUS
Then, a little bit later, there was a flood
A big downpour rained on our god-like ideas
There’s tension in the air, and smoke on the water
But how do you get around used-up happiness?
We’re like the little rabbits in the commercial
We bang on the drum until love runs out
But it’s too hard to make it last forever..
What I love is the beginning
Not the end, the end
