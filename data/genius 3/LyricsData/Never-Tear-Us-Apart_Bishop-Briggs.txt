[Verse 1]
Don't ask me
What you know is true
Don't have to tell you
Oh, I love your precious heart

[Chorus]
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart

[Verse 2]
And we could live
For a thousand years
But if I hurt you
I'd make wine from your tears
Oh, I told you
That we could fly
Cause we all have wings
But some of us don't know why

[Chorus]
I was standing
You were there
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart
And they could never ever tear us apart
Oh, oh, oh

I was standing (I was standing)
You were there (You were there)
Two worlds collided
And they could never ever tear us apart (tear us apart)
Tear us apart, oh woah
And they could never ever tear us apart
