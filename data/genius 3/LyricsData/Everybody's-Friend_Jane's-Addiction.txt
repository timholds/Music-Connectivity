Hey man where did you go?
Thought I, but I guess
I don't know you
Gave you my heart
You looked to take it apart
Hey man what did you do?
Walked away we weren't through
Last time was a fake shaken head
Now I think it must be said

Hey man
Can't be everybody's friend
Hey man
Can't be everybody's friend

Man of peace
Man of war
Tell me who knows more?
People gathering by the well
I think we could meet up again

Hey man
Can't be everybody's friend
Hey man
Can't be everybody's friend

Hey man
Can't be everybody's friend
Ain't no way man
To be everybody's friend
