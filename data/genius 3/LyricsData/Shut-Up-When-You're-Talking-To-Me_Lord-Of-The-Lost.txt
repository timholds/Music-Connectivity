[Strophe 1]
I fucked your girlfriend in the washroom
I am her lover, her sinner, her killer and her priest
She even masturbates to this tune
But isn't that the way you wanna be pleased

[Bridge 1]
Do you love, do you love me, do you, do do do
If I don't give and never gave a fuck about the scene
Do you love me, do you love me, do you, do do do
Shut up when you're talking to me

[Chorus 1]
You only love me when I'm bad and mean
But will you love when I'm sane and clean
I'll be everything you'll never be
But if you dare to judge me
Shut up when you're talking to me

[Strophe 2]
I did your boyfriend just to unload
He is a love, a sinner, an angel on his knees
The lord is on his lips, in his throat
But isn't that the way you wanna see me

[Bridge 1]
Do you love, do you love me, do you, do do do
If I don't give a fuck, if I'm the king, if I'm the queen
Do you love me, do you love me, do you, do do do
Shut up when you're talking to me

[Chorus 1]

[Bridge 2]
Where do these scars come from - Did I hurt someone, oh no
Where do these scars come from - Do you know
Where do these scars come from - Did I hurt someone, oh no
Where do these scars come from - I don't know

[Chorus 2]
You only love me when I'm bad and mean
But will you love when I'm sane and clean
I'll be your fetish and you life extreme
I'll be your memories, I'll live your dream
I'll be everything you'll never be
But if you dare to judge me
Shut up when you're talking to me
