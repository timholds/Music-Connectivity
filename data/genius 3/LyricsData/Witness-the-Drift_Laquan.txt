[ VERSE 1: Laquan ]
We're monitored and the majority sounds alike
So we decided to invent a modified
Type that resembles no one
This method is identical to none
No procrastinating, we must hustle
On the strenght we gotta use much muscle
Lyrics are written for the public
Get to know this rhythm and love it
This style is smooth
Become one with the groove
And it's pumpin, so move
Knowledge from the lyrics, get involved with the clique
And witness words as they drift

Witness the drift

[ VERSE 2: Laquan ]
Flow on my boat of festivity, ignore negativity
And sail with me inm y lyrical treasure
If it's projected correctly music is pleasure
Positive science I'm droppin
Poetry's in motion like two lovers knockin
Soundin like another, that isn't my motto
See, I'm a leader not a follower
A portion of poets sound equivalent
They need to fabricate a style that's different
Drift to the music but don't miss the message
I'm droppin, your job's to catch it
Stop harrassin, we're not assassins
I'm just a vocalist far from Charles Manson
Brothers livin foul, they're actin like juveniles
They're goin a mile, man, they need to calm down
Speakin my theory as the crowd get near me
Yo, turn up the mic so they can hear me clearly
Then I be set
Yo Eric, how you feel about that? (Cool) Bet
Paintin a picture, learn from the scripture
TKO once the bass hits ya
Wounded by the lyrics, kicked by the bass
Peace to Style One, Deja, Mark and Tase
Cool, calm, almighty Laquan
I'm a menace to society and heavily armed
I'm a soloist, one DJ and a gun
Two heads are better than one
Peep out this misfit, it's dope, isn't it?
Get close to your speaker and witness the drift

Witness the drift

[ VERSE 3: Laquan ]
Calm, swift is how the vocal tone is thrown
As I let it be know that the blind will roam
In the dark as I spark and set a mark in this art
For a cause, save the applaus for last
As I blast and strive at a task
At a slow pace cause haste make waste
Most of you want to do what I do
State facts on wax and make a million too
As I thrust this style style of speak
You're hypnotized as sound waves seep
Deep within and I'm gonna send you
Words that alternate at a constant rate
Picture yourself trapped in a cage
Your mind is in rage, you wake up, it's a stage
You think it's a dream, but you're still a prisoner
Cause I cook shrimps as if I was Sizzler
Here is the movement, work for improvement
Join hand in hand, back to the Motherland
It doesn't matter what your shade is
We need to set it straight, he think the land is his
I'm not taxin, stop ridin my tip
A smooth coaster, I don't flip, trip
Step tot his, as your spirit uplifts
Become a part of this, witness the drift

Witness the drift
