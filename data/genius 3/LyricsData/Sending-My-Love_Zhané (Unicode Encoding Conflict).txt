[Intro]
If I could mail my heart
Right to you, I would
I'd pack it up, seal it tight
And I'd send it overnight

[Verse 1]
Every time I hear your voice
And I look into your eyes
Sends a burning sweet sensation
Oh, inside of me
The look in your eyes has found me
I am sending

[Chorus]
Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love
Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love

[Verse 2]
With my heart in your hands
I'm as helpless as a baby
I'm in desperate need of your love
So just send it right away
I've been thinking bout you, boy
Because you're so far way
Makes me want to send you all this love
Inside of me
The look in your eyes has found me
I am sending

[Chorus]
Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love
Sending my love to you
Praying that you are home
Sealing it with a kiss
Sending my love

[Outro]
If I could mail my heart
Right to you, I would
I'd pack it up, seal it tight
And I'd send it overnight
