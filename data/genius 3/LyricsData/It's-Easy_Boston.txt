[Verse 1]
Hey, I've got no place to be and no one I'd rather see
I won't mind if you can find the time to stay with me
I've got no time for wasting, I gotta live a life well I can
I won't hide and you decide to let me be your man

'Cause when I get close to you, not much to say
I get that same old feeling I had in my younger days

[Chorus]
And I can show you the way
It's just a game we play
It's easy, taking it day by day
It's easy, easy, easy

[Verse 2]
Hey, you know I would concede and I think we both agree
You and I can testify that love is what we need
Just take a look around you, living for the future is blind
I believe what we achieve will soon be left behind

The things that I try to say, so hard to find
When you doubt what your life is about let me ease you mind

[Chorus

[Verse 1]
