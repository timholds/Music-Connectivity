[Intro]
And if you don't need my love
I'll give it all away

[Strophe 1]
No one ever saw me
Nobody ever cared
No one ever stole my heart
And left the half unpaired

Spring went by
Summer lead to fall
In winters night
A devil in the sky
And after all
The agonies and fears
Did someone hear my call
And came to dry my tears
Or let me fall?

[Chorus]
And if you don't need my love
I'll give it all away
And if you refuse I prostitute
My heart for sale

I prostitute my heart for sale

[Strophe 2]
No one ever listened
Or spoke once in a while
No one ever touched my heart
But left me undefiled

Spring went by
Summer lead to fall
In winters night
A devil in the sky

[Chorus (x2)]

[Bridge 1]
In agonies and fears
Will someone hear my call
And come to dry my tears
Or let me fall?

[Bridge 2 (x2)]
(And if you don't need my love)
I prostitute my heart for sale
(And if you don't need my love)
I'll give it all, i'll give it all away

[Chorus (x4)]
