Read your book
Climb into bed
Get out of bed
It’s getting bright
Gone to work
Or sleeping in
You choose
I’m easy
I’m all the time
Come back to me
From the USA
Takes a minute
But I remember how we fit
And everything’s right where we left it
I want what every body wants
You knew I was coming
This place is so clean
Let’s mess it up
I’m fine with the routine
For the first and last time
Get in between me and this home
Cover me all the time
I’m back to you
From whatever country
Didn’t pay very much attention
But everything’s right where we left it
Even left myself right here
Watching everything work
It runs like a dream
I could turn on anything
Any light
Day or night
And make it sing
Watching everything work
It runs like a dream
Better than anything
Put the TV on
I gotta go
I’m back again
We can’t find you a job
But everything works
In the meantime I’ll cover you up
Cover me all the time
Take a week off
Take a month off
Take my shirt off
Take a year off
Let’s take off
We can make a move
We can stand down
You choose
I’m easy
I’m all the time
Watching everything work
It runs like a dream
I could turn on anything
Any light
Day or night
And make it sing
Watching everything work
It runs like a dream
Better than anything
