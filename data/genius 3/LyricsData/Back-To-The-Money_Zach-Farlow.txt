[Intro]
Gotta get back to the money

[Hook]
I gotta get back to money
I gotta get back to money
I gotta get back to money
I gotta get back to money
Riding around with a pistol and switchblade
If that don't work
Then it's back to the rich game
If that don't work
Then it's back to the whip game
I don't give a fuck
I'm going on a rampage

[Verse 1]
Styrofoam cup still fill with the pink shit
In my whip
Cause that's my favorite place to think in
Life be moving fast
I be on some don't blink shit
Like a peasant
My handle imma keep it
Cellphone keep ringing
Trying to make a play
Because the junkies keep feening
Gotta make a way if I wanna stay clean
I'm sorry baby
I ain't trying to be mean yeah, but
But I gotta get back to the money
Cause I know you gone need some
I gotta get back to the money
If I'm ever gone be something
I don't want to talk
If it ain't about the money
Homie Why you even call?
Acting like a dummy
You should crash into a wall
You telling me you love me
Baby I ain't about to fall for that
All the women that I love
Always leaving me
All I ever wanted was for them to believe in me
I never gave up and never had them feeding me
I'm increasing it
They decreasing me
Never fuck over your brothers over women
That's love
Never fuck em over in general homie
That's soft
Good friends are hard to come by
And yeah, shawty you can come by
Just know that..

[Verse 2]
I was down bad
Fucked up
Had to move different
Had to change up
Couple loose ends
That came undone
I had to lose friends
And I can name one for sure
I stayed down for my day one's
And they know
But shit changed and I guess it's just how it go
Damn man what the fuck happened to you cuh
Got some money now you acting brand new huh
On snap you was with the sneak dissing
I know I snap too but when I do it
It's just different
But I ain't bout to go acting all crazy
But the way you acting foul you flagrant
When I'm on the mic you know shit can get dangerous
I ain't say your name cause I ain't making you famous
Next time you say mine you better save it
I'm going light next time I'm throwing shade to you
You gone fuck around and make me slim shady you
I can have the whole wide world hating you
Maybe I was fucked up drugged out
All I needed was a shovel until you dug out
You suppose to be my brother what you done now
Just because we ain't blow you gone run now?

[Hook]
I gotta get back to money
I gotta get back to money

Then it's back to the rich game
If that don't work

[Outro]
If you not with me take that tattoo off your shoulder
Just know it ain't over till it's over
It's not over till it's over
It's not over till it's over
