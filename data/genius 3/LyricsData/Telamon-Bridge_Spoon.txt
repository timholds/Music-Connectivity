I want more than this bed
I was about to get through with this
It's too short but you got a hold of what's wrong in life with me more or less
I feel you let go and I feel you let go and I feel you let go and I feel you let go
I'm on Telamon bridge and I'm professing of your lies evermore
I can't fake can't fake it no more and I'm too tired to make it so leave it alone
How will these innovations impact their entry as a whole
I want more than this bed so I'll give you my case and then I'll go on home
