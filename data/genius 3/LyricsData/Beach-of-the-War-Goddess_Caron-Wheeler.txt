[Yoruba Incantation:]
Eshu ma se mi, omo elomiran ni o se
Eshu laroye aburnbu Eshu I aroye
Anamunamu hata, O fe bata kujo
Bamu-bamu
Eshu yago fun mi lona, kinse temi fi owo wo
Mi onibode lorun, Emi no imo Oduduna
Li owo wo ma
Ma jeri nri ija re o owo Odumare ni a fi nwo afin
Fi owo wo mi, emi ni omo Ododuna. Odumare ma jeri nri ija esu Odumare ase

The war goddess is definitely in here
The babalowa is definitely in here
And Cinderella is definitely in here
And Kundalini is definitely in here

Now listen to the rhythm of the magic man
Nuff respect to the goddess and the caravan
Said no more bowing to another man
G-G-Guess who's coming to the motherland

[Hook:]
Beach of the war goddess
Beach of the war goddess
War goddess, war goddess

[Verse 1: Caron Wheeler]
Years I have known I am living in a war zone
Poison of my enemy blatantly attacking me
War goddess arouse your power
Know this is indeed your hour
Dying to be heard literally
Constant screams convincing me
War

[Rap: Cinderella MC]
Back to life, right back to reality
Let me explain how things used to be
As a black girl living in society
Things have been hard not too good for me

[Verse 2: Caron Wheeler]
Words are my swords I advance and hold them to my breast
Shield always ready I am used to living at the edge
Life is an ocean and our souls provide the ocean bed
Nuff illumination for this generation
War

[Hook]

[War Goddess Rap: Cinderella]
Versatile and hard like cement
Right here now me gone independent
True God me trust and God will prevent
Cinderella from keep silent
Me no want the back biter them fe rejoice
'cos Cinderella a da peoples' choice
Watch me now people me na jest
Caron an me we are two war goddess

[War God Rap: Kundalini]
The goddess said that no one could defeat us
'Cause no other man could ever beat us
The opposite of what they tell
We got weak and we beat ourselves
This is an age of the new wave minds
Ancestors shedding light from the early times
Giving ideas to me with the funky rhymes
Giving answers to you in these funky times

The war goddess is definitely in here
The babalowa is definitely in here
And Cinderella is definitely in here
And Kundalini is definitely in here
