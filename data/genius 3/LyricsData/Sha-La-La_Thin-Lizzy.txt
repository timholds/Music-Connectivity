A strange kind of magic, call it voodoo
You want that woman, yes, you do
Believe me, baby, I know it's true
Come on, sugar, let me give it to you

I want to sha-la-la
Ooh right

Black magic woman, you've got a hole
Come on, sugar, I'll lose control
I want your body, not your soul
Come on, baby, take my jelly roll

I want to sha-la-la
Ooh right

Hey, honey
Want some money
Go find it

I want to sha-la-la
Ooh right
