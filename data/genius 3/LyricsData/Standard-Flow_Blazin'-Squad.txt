(Rocky B)
In the beginning there were two decks and a microphone
In the end the Blazin' Squad stoodalone
Where the Eastends best kept secret
Ten men in our crew
TNP Xplosive
Bringing the tunes
And we're all busting standard flows

(Melo-D)
I'm blazin hot like the heat of the sun
No time to loose put the suppressor on the gun
Make no mistake cause Melo-D is number one
Dont even want to step me because the battle has been won
Hype up the set 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
Better brace yourself for the fight is to become
A battle of all dapa d's fighting for the right to be a garage MC

(Strider)
Stop, wait here i go, MC Sniper top of the show
Come step to me im a p-r-o
If you get rude
Get peoples elbow, we're coming at ya with the standard flow
You've hit rock bottom, and then I bust the eyebrow
So step to me your get done, don't hesitate just bring it on

(Rocky B - Chorus)
Standard flow we alert the 5, 0
Come with the lyric to make you go woh
Come with the lyric tomake you say, bo
(Rocky B here if you didn't know)
Standard flow you see us at shows
Blazin' Squad upon the radio, 3, 2, 1, and its time to go
Who's up next on the microphone

(Repeat)

(Flava)
When i come through black suit
White shirt better quit the game
You ain't gonna be the one with money to gain, yo
Throw your hands in the air if you wanna test this, ha
Thats what I thought so i said you couldn't
And even if you could, you know you really shouldn't
I'll pull it over your eyes and over your face and Flava's
Surprise is what you can taste
So don't be late
Coz these cats tempt no fate
MCs wanna hate never wanna act bait
So fat,so never sound wack on this track
Takin your boys, my kru be down for these cats

(Spike-e)
Cotched in the back of a blacked out car
With the rhythm rolling upon the speaker
Chromed out alloys and a lower bumper
Twin exhaust and a private number
Spike-e MC gets you hyper
You think i'm dark well i go deeper
Think your quicker well im just quicker
Two spinning decks and a fat mixer
Think you're bad well im just badder
Bare fake MCs and i can't stand ya

(Repeat Chorus x2)
(Freek)
Oi, its my story
How we done this robbery
So listen and listen good
Coz Blazin are back in the hood
Come across sniper better better touch wood
You should know, step to Flava get wablo
Make sure you dont wreck Kenzie's show
He'll lick you up from your head to your toe
He don't care about 5,0
All they do is smoke hi-jo
MC Freek im a lyrical pro, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0
5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and 0

(Krazy)
This one's standard this one heavy
This is a story all about me
The one the Krazy
You know im heavy
Cause whern im on the mic
Im a lyrical G
Im a raver, going further
Getting louder
Forthe one tongue twister
Blazin' Squad will get ya hyper

(Kenzie)
Back in the beginning it was me and Flava
The two best MCs inside your manor
Enter the streets with your Dolca and Gabbana
Get the listening raver hy-pper cha
Hit em with the flash lighter
Up middle finger we come and get ya
Enter my H and G selector
When im spitting out my lyrics
Spitting out my lyrics
Pull by the trigger its another winner
My lyrical flow will just makeyou shiver
Kenzie MC with the lyrical thriller
Westside i just stand and deliver
Zimm zimmer get up make you quiver
Cruising right behind you in my bim bimmer
Joy riding policemen undercover
Me and my crew we do it proper

(Repeat Chorus x4 to Fade)
