I used to think that we were
Always gonna be in love
But I was so naive back then
I wasn't wise enough
To know there ain't nothing
In this life that's guaranteed
You take your chances
When you let your heart lead

And heaven knows how much
I wanted to keep loving you
You let me down
When you said some things
That were untrue
So I'm giving you up
Cause there ain't enough
Love in this world
To change my mind
We're out of time
The dream is over

[Chorus:]
I've got my reasons
For the way that I feel
Suffered in silence
When I had to conceal
My honest emotions
Truth must be revealed
Might not be right but I've just
Got to be real

We could go on forever
Never really letting go
What's the sense in that
When in our hearts we knew
This isn't working
We're on a dead end road

Don't think my back can stand
The weight of the load

And while it's hard for me
To admit we made a mistake
I can't pretend no more
It's too much to take
Time for moving on
Said all I have to say

Won't live a lie
This is goodbye
The dream is over now

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
And as I walk away
Though I'm leaving
With tears and regrets
There are memories
Of you I will never forget
Shared I will never
Forget

But it's time for me to
Do what my heart
Tells me to

I have to be strong
But right or wrong
I'll always love you

[Chorus]
