It's a hollow hand
That pulls you into
An otherworldly land
So alluring and new
And the higher ground
Where you took your stand
Has now leveled down to the sand

A search for your last destination
You're already there
Where madness and bliss coexist
With the color that is
Filling the air

A distorted utopia sets in
With it brings a new beginning to every end
And it's all you've never had
And it's all you'll never know
You're feigning reality and coming down too slow

An ever changing map
A spiraled path
A picture of the past where
No time has elapsed
On another plane
Where you left yourself out of your body again

A search for your last destination
You're already there
Where madness and bliss coexist
With the color that is
Filling the air

A distorted utopia sets in
With it brings a new beginning to every end
And it's all you've never had
And it's all you'll never know
You're feigning reality and coming down too slow

Out of body out of mind
Entheogenic the divine
The divine

Faced with an endless maze
Never ending race
Follow your reflection blindly through the blackended haze

Unrealistic it's so masochistic
A display of the self
And you're purged as the flood washes over
Leaving you barren and cold
