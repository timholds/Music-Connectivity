[Verse 1]
You and I can fight this out together
You and I, we're riding out the storm
You and I could play this tune forever
You and I, we're breaking every rule

[Chorus]
I know it ain't right
I know it ain't fair
To hold on to love, a love that's no longer there
I know it ain't right
I know it ain't fair
To hold on to love, a love that's no longer there
But I'm holding out and I'm holding on
Holding out for you

[Verse 2]
Take a look around, youâ€™ll see we're crumbling
Piece by piece, we fade into the floor
Hold it all together but it's breaking
Endless cycle fated now to fall

[Chorus]
I know it ain't right
I know it ain't fair
To hold on to love, a love that's no longer there
I know it ain't right
I know it ain't fair
To hold on to love, a love that's no longer there
But I'm holding out and I'm holding on
Holding out for you my only love

[Bridge]
It ain't right
It ain't right
It ain't right
I know
I know

[Chorus]
I know it ain't right
I know it ain't fair
To hold on to love, a love that's no longer there
But I'm holding out and I'm holding on
Holding out for you
