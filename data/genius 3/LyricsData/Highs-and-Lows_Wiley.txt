[Intro]
Yo
Eskiboy aka Wiley
Yo

[Verse 1]
So many highs and lows in one lifetime
I avoid knife crime
It's not a nice sight
Thought of this people pull out the [?]
Another life gone, and I'm trying to get my life right
Even though I play loud in your hi-fi
Appear at your screen, connected to the wi-fi
Down to earth like [?] in the [?]
But I like hype for the hype, no hype-guide
And I'm under the kush no wide eye
You can hear the [?] like [?] it's mine, I
Tell 'em "If you don't like me, fly high"
Cause that's what I'm gonna do
Until I drop back down, I'm right in the loop
LA to London like Tinie and Snoop
All along I know I kept it steady
But now I'm ready

[Hook]
There are highs and lows in situations at surface
We all know this
In this kind of job you're bound to make money
But the money you make, you won't notice
When zeroes staring at ya, glaring at ya, you lose your focus
That's why I go round the country, making magic, hocus-pocus
But when I drop down, it's all part of the highs and the lows
And when I go up, it's still part of the highs and the lows
But when I drop down, it's all part of the highs and the lows
And when I go up, it's still part of the highs and the lows

[Verse 2]
I never had  a forward-thinking parent
Only two, that forgot I was alive
Going back I was a child, they wanted to live more
Don't hate them, but it's bother when I try
I'm going on happy, don't lose my temper
Don't rate stars, if I was a mentor
But I still standby with a mind of a guy in a landmine
I mine for coal, while they mine for hangtime
We all rest when my head says "stop"
I keep going like I ain't gotta watch
I lived on a fullback ting
I approach war like fullback king:
I've won, we win
I travel the world cause I know no better
Some hate me, cause they know no better
I don't know what they put in this homemade ginger beer, but I sense it's pepper

[Hook]
There are highs and lows in situations at surface
We all know this
In this kind of job you're bound to make money
But the money you make, you won't notice
When zeroes staring at ya, glaring at ya, you lose your focus
That's why I go round the country, making magic, hocus-pocus
But when I drop down, it's all part of the highs and the lows
And when I go up, it's still part of the highs and the lows
But when I drop down, it's all part of the highs and the lows
And when I go up, it's still part of the highs and the lows
