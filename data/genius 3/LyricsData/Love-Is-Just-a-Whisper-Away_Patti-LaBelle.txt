People will tell you
So many things
Just to be closer to you
Darlin' believe in me
I'm gonna try
To help you see your way through
I'm on your side
Anytime day or right
Live is just a whisper away
No need to shout
That ain't what it's about
Love is just a whisper away
Really don't matter
Where you may be
You've got a griend in me
Don't be shy
I'll be here
Stop on by
All of your tears I'll dry
No doubt about it
No one should stand alone
Come on in time of need
My love will guide you
When you can't find your way
I'll move mountains for you
If you just ask me to
Baby let me do something for you
I'm on your side
Anytime day or night
Love is just a whisper away
No need to shout
That ain't what it's about
Love is just a whisper away
