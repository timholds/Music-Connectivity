[Verse 1]
I think it's about time we
Had a discussion about us
And I think it's about time we
Turned off the TV, and had a conversation

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone, I just wanna have someone
I don't wanna be alone, I just wanna have someone
Who laughs at my shit jokes
Won't break me when I'm already broken

[Post-Chorus]
Whenever you want it, whenever you want it
I'm ready, ooohhh, ooohhh, I'm ready, for you and me

[Verse 2]
I've had it with playing games
I've gambled on this and I've lost, out before
And I don't want to quantify
The multiple reasons, why I am sure

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone, I just wanna have someone
I don't wanna be alone, I just wanna have someone
Who laughs at my shit jokes
Won't break me when I'm already broken

[Post-Chorus]
Whenever you want it, whenever you want it
I'm ready, ooohhh, ooohhh, I'm ready, for you and me

[Bridge]
So simply could it be?
Move closer over to me, move closer over to me

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be alone, I just wanna have someone
I don't wanna be alone, I just wanna have someone
Who laughs at my shit jokes
Won't break me when I'm already broken

[Post-Chorus]
Whenever you want it, whenever you want it
I'm ready, ooohhh, ooohhh, I'm ready, for you and me
