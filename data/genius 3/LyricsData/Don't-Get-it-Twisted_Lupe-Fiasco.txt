"Neeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrdd!"

Westside, Baby
What's good?
I'm only gonna do this once, man
Once
Till the album come
So, check it out

Verse:
From the M-A...D-I, to the S to the O-N,potent
To getcha open, move like a nigga's supposed to get the dough, it'll go with the flow that I'm holdin'
Yo' man, they ain't "On Enuff", or up on enough, to stay in the zone that I go in
That I go in, when I go in and go in, of the poems, that were wrote and
Crucial Conflict was smokin',but a nigga like me, I don't be chokin'
So I proceed at a low speed, low key, like a OG in a '03 Loc-in'
Rollin' like a OZ, in a b-leaf,both pins, like a bowlin' ball when I ball
But I never fall for the oki-dokin',whitewalls and the slow-speed motion
Stash-box for the police pokin',Rolie showin, shorty showin
Hokey Pokin',turnin' it around with me to bust 'em down cause they know he golden
Exactly; I'm in it from the minute I was in it, 'til the minute that I spit it and I'm finished,and it's sad for me
Until the second wind, and reinvent it with a vengeance, revisit and make 'em give it back to me

Outro:
All right, that's all you get
I'm done
You know what I'm sayin'?
In the streets where they traffic me
Nigga what
