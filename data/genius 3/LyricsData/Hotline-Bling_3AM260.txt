[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And i know when that hotline bling.. that can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city you
Switched on who you said you wouldn't change on
Hung with clubbers until you became one
Now every night you dancing to the same songs
Cause ever since i left the city you
You've became more heartless and impatient
I swear this ain't the girl i used to hang with
I seen you round some boys with reputations

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And i know when that hotline bling.. that can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling that can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Ever since i left the city you you you
You and i aren't where we used to be
The old you's gone and it's so new to me
Eyes closed, to myself thinking who is she who is she
Ever since I left the city you
Ditched your friends for unfamiliar faces
Girl I'm not a fan of all these changes
Seen you round some boys with reputations yeah

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And i know when that hotline bling.. that can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling that can only mean one thing

[Verse 3]
Girl what's on my mind is that it's crazy i don't know you after all that we've been through
Tell me exactly who's this person you've changed into
Maybe you've grown up, or I just didn't know ya
Please don't push me away, girl I'm just searching for closure
Let me dig alittle deeper, get alittle closer
Cause I knew you but the new yous taking over
I feel as if you changed to fit in
You even changed on your friends
I catch myself thinking what we could of been

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And i know when that hotline bling.. that can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling that can only mean one thing

[Outro]
Every since i left city...
