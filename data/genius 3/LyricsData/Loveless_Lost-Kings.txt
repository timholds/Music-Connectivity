[Verse 1]
Every morning
I've been running
Chasing Every piece of you
When you jump ship
It's sunken
It's something you already knew
If I'm the only one, drowning in the ocean
I will let your waves around
Sending us away, leave me feeling broken
You will never be tied down

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd rather be love sick than loveless
It's a perfect storm but I love it
I'll take the pain with the pleasure
I'd rather be love sick than loveless
I'd rather be
I'd rather be love sick than loveless
I'd rather be

[Chorus]
I'd rather be love sick than loveless
It's a perfect storm but I love it
I'll take the pain with the pleasure
I'd rather be love sick than loveless
I'd rather be

[Verse 2]
You're a vision, my religion
Nothing ever felt so right
You are the condition, my addiction
I will be your sacrifice
If I'm the only one, drowning in the ocean
I will let your waves around
Sending us away, leave me feeling broken
You will never be tied down

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd rather be love sick than loveless
It's a perfect storm but I love it
I'll take the pain with the pleasure
I'd rather be love sick than loveless
I'd rather be
I'd rather be love sick than loveless
I'd rather be

[Chorus]
I'd rather be love sick than loveless
It's a perfect storm but I love it
I'll take the pain with the pleasure
I'd rather be love sick than loveless
I'd rather be
