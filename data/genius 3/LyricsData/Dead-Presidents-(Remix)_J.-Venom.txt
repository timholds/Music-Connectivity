[Intro]
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me

[Verse: J. Venom]
Man it all started with a bottle of pills
And now I'm trying to get some fucking bills
Get my momma a house up in them fucking hills
Use the nightlife to make my nice life
But everybody knows that fucking shit, it ain't ever work right

But I know I can't stop now
Everybody and they momma buying heroin all around town
So I gotta get mine, get some bread that same time
Man it looks like it might be a nice night to die
Man I wonder what my old friends might think?
If they found me, with that shit up under my sink

Ya'll only know cause ya boy done told ya
Calling red rover but that fucker done rolled over
Venom bitch, alias from the beginning
It was all a fucking joke made up chilling for the phone to ring
All the good times before I chose my path
Shit it's too late now, man all that's on my mind is cash

I really wonder what my fucking life would be like
If I ever stopped to take them SATs right?
Followed all my friends to school instead of out on the grind?
I can't get the possibilities out of my mind

It's hard not to think of my life as a fucking waste
All I did was get high and fucking paperchase
Man even if I ever do make it
I'm still that fucking guy, and habits are hard to break bitch

[Outro]
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fucking presidents to represent me
