[Verse 1]
Oh, it's just the wine
I shouldn't be drinkin'
Things cross my mind
I don't need to be thinkin'

[Verse 2]
When it comes to you
I got a weak heart
It's hard goin' through
Bein' this far apart

[Chorus]
The blues, come and go on me, baby
I just get lonely, lonely, oh

[Verse 3]
Oh, I try to fight it
I try not to call
I keep comin' back
To what went wrong

[Verse 4]
Wish I could just let it
Go on and be over
I know I'll regret it
In the mornin' when I'm sober

[Chorus]
It's hurt talkin', it's not me, oh baby
I just get lonely, oh I

[Bridge]
The voice you're hearin', at the end of the line
It's just hurt talkin', it's not mine

[Verse 5]
This moment of weakness
These things that I feel
It's not anything
Time won't heal, oh baby

[Outro]
I just get lonely, oh I
I just get lonely, oh
I just get lonely, oh
(Lonely, lonely)
