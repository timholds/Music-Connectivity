Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair
Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair

Drillin' a hole with my soul in the sand
Diggin' for gold in the hole in the bed
Catchin' a ride from a band
I sat in the back of the van
They tried to make me understand
'Cause if I'm not in a band, don't mean I'm square
And if I am, well then I don't care

Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair

Number two has got me confused
Hope I'll always be numbers one and three
Number two has got me confused
Hope I'll always be numbers one and three

Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair
Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair

Drillin' a hole with my soul in the sand
Diggin' for gold for the ho in the bed
Catchin' a ride from a band
I sat in the back of the van
They tried to make me understand
That if I'm not in a band, don't mean I'm square
And if I am, well then I don't care

Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair
Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair

You said, hell, well I don't care
If you run your hands through my car wash hair
Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair

You said, hell, well I don't care
If you run your hands through my car wash hair
Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair

You said, hell, well I don't care
If you run your hands through my car wash hair
Wanna ask but I just stare
Can I run my hands through your car wash hair
