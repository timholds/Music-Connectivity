[Verse 1]
I've been waiting a long time
For this moment to come
I'm destined for anything at all
Downtown lights will be shining
On me like a new diamond
Ring, out under the midnight hour
Well, no one can touch me now, well
And I can't turn my back yet
It's too late
Ready or not at all

[Chorus]
Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known
Wake up

[Verse 2]
Dawning of a new era
Calling, don't let it catch you falling
Ready or not at all
Well, so close, enough to taste it
Almost, I can embrace this feeling
On the tip of my tongue

[Chorus]
Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known
Wake up

[Bridge]
Better thank your lucky stars
Say hey, hey

[Chorus]
Well, I'm so much closer than
I have ever known
Wake up

[Bridge]
Better thank your lucky stars
Say hey, hey

[Verse 3]
I've been waiting a long time
For this moment to come
I'm destined for anything at all
Dumbstruck, color me stupid
Good luck, you're gonna need it
Where I'm going if I get there at all
Wake up
Better thank your lucky stars
