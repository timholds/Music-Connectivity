Plans and schemes
Thoughts and dreams
Who cares what they mean
When they work they're amazing things
When they don't I hear you scream

Spiders and flies , live and die
Six legs to stand on and two wings to fly
I can't remember and I can't decide
What was the season and the color of your eyes

Pharaohs and kings
Favourite queens
Buried with their
Precious rings
When they lived they loved complete
But in their tombs I hear them scream

Spiders and flies, live and die
Six legs to stand on and two wings to fly
I can't remember and I can't decide
What was the season and the color of your eyes

Psalms and spells
Magic blast
Who cares what they cast
I dreamed I'd always love you complete
I never thought I'd hear you scream

Spiders and flies, live and die
Eight legs to stand on and two wings to fly
It makes you wonder, why can't I
What was the reason for the colour of your eyes

Spiders and flies, live and die.....
