Strange love
Cutest thing I ever seen
Strange love
Cutest thing I ever seem
You remind me of something
That I have seen in a dream

Can I take you out to dinner
Some place where we can be alone?
Can I take you out to dinner
Some place where we can be alone?
Tell you how much I love you
Then let me hold you in my arms

You as sweet as honey
Love to be yo' honey comb
You as sweet as any honey
I love to be yo' honey comb
Then when the time is right, darlin'
There'll be some lovin' goin' on
