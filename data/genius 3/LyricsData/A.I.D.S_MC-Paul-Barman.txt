[Verse 1]
A.I.D.S makes folks a('fraid) to get laid
Lets trade knowledge and make that shit fade
It's transmitted in semen and blood
Ya can't get it from a kiss or a hug
It's bugged that were team-less, some like extremists
H.I.V. via needle or anus to penis
Oh where you might shit
Its a tight fit
Ya break blood vessels that no light hit
Sexual revolution
No tests then for preventable pollution; thusly
Confusion
Of T-cells bleed and heed well to stay protected
No matter who's elected, you know it's still the same
If Europe were infected, we'd drop pills from planes
Big pharm' pimped em', but it may be impossible to do more then suppress a symptom
They paid for a race war
Instead of an A.I.D.S. cure!

[Verse 2]
I cozy up to the mic like a cat at the hearth
You don't know what its like to have a dearth of dark thoughts
And be happy all the time
Why'm
I rhymin'
Because I'm obsessed with it and you know I'm good at it and I love it so you're gonna listen to it (ha-ha-ha-ha)
How your family reacts will set the tone
Some are disowned, even thrown out the home
E'eryone deserve love, ne'er left alone
Ya can't get A.I.D.S from shared silverware
And there's no need to spray your toilet seat with aerosol
Bear it all, please!
Ya can't get A.I.D.S from a cough or sneeze; even if someone bleeds
Needs a fresh wound with flesh ruined, or unprotected sex
Half a million folks don't know they're infected in the US
And they're more dangerous then those who come up positive in tests
So go tell the next kid to go get tested
A problem won't go away unless we address it
