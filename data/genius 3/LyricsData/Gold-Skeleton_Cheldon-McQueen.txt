[Verse 1]
Damn
Thought you'd be here forever
But even weathermen can't predict the weather
I could nose dive off the most high into a kettle
But drowning doesn't help It only makes you wetter
Hear that?
The screams
The cries
From all
Inside
When the hearts
Collide
I've screamed
I've cried
Let out
My soul
It's seems like every time I blink it's another year old it like It started as a dream two years ago
Wasn't tryna be deuce bigalow male gigolo
But these girls kind of act like they never really seen a hero
In case you're wonderin'
Golden autumn on they wishing summer would end
And somewhere along the line I heard, that I should meet some better people
But the more dramatic life is only makes for a better sequels
Just because you better people that don't make you better people
The black pharaoh in black camaros they pledge allegiance to the

[Hook]
Hasty decisions in a room full of doors
Sittin' here waiting for the fumes to perform
Must be a pharaoh I'm in tune with my soul
So when I die bury me in a tomb full of gold

[Verse 2]
Gold skeleton
So I can live forever
Through my rhymes and my style I'm-a live forever
They try to lock me down
Nothing major though
Oh, so you sick with the rhyming?
Well I'm vicks vapor rub
Welcome to the table where we're tryna get our paper up
Autumn got them stinging like the freshest of the paper cuts
Queen candidate for the freshest of the millennium
That's why they want to know my intel like pentium
Haters, I got plenty of them but I never gave a fuck about any them
I might be gone for a long time
For what? killing em
Welcome to the coast where
We strive to ride on vogues
And our speech a little slow cause there's syrup in our throats
And the girls like a guy who isn't your average bloke addicted to snorting coke or classified as broke
High standards
Or at least that's what I'm telling them
They just want to die with gold around their skeleton

[Hook 2]
Hasty decisions in a room full of doors
Sittin' here waiting for the fumes to dissolve
Must be a pharaoh I'm in tune with my soul
So when I die bury me in a tomb full of gold
