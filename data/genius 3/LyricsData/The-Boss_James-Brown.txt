[Intro]
1 2 get down

[Chorus 1]
Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss
I paid the cost to be the boss

[Chorus 2]
Look at me you know what you see
You see a bad mother
Look at me you know what you see
You see a bad mother

[Chorus 1]
Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss

[Chorus 2]
Look at me you know what you see
You see a bad mother
Look at me you know what you see
You see a bad mother

[Bridge]
Told you so!
Told you so!
Having fun, got money to burn
Having fun, got money to burn
Having fun, got money to burn
Having fun, got money to burn

[Chorus 1]
Paid the cost to be the boss
Paid the cost to be the boss
I paid the cost to be the boss

[Bridge]
Cross the tracks (uh), turned my back
Cross the tracks (uh), turned my back

[Chorus 1]
Paid the cost to be the boss

[Chorus 2]
I'm a bad mother, I'm a bad mother

Head for the turn around
Head for the turn around
Told you so!

[Chorus 1]
Paid the cost to be the boss
