Oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah
Oh oh yeah

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
As I'm checkin' up on the rhythm and make
The whole sound sweet
Not like candy you taste that say it can be
YMCO music is good to the truth it's agree

Over and on and on and on and on and on and
Over us all and all to all for all and all to

Each for me and I for y'all
United we stand, divided we fall
One for all and all for one
United we stand, we'll get the job done
Each for me and I for y'all
United we stand, divided we fall
One for all and all for one
United we stand, we'll get the job done

Oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah
Oh oh oh oh yeah

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
Rockin', rollin' under the melody
And make the whole sound neat and sweet
Yes, from me to you, you taste that say
It's too good to be true
One for all and all for one and you agree
Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
As I'm checkin' up on the rhythm
And make the whole sound sweet

Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through
Just stand only for you
Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through
Just stand only for you
Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through
Just stand only for you
Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through
Just stand only for you

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
As I'm checkin' up on the rhythm and make
The whole sound sweet
Not like candy you taste that so you can be
YMCO music is good to the truth and you agree

Over and on and on and on and on and on and
It's all over your life there, hey yeah, hey yeah

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
Rockin' over the beat, rollin' under the melody
Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
Rockin', rollin', rollin', rockin', rockin', rollin', rollin', rock

Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through
Just stand only for you
Get into the sound, keep rollin' the tune
Feel like rockin' the whole track through
Just stand only for you
(Stand only for you) just stand only for you
(Stand only for you) stand only for you
Only for, only for you (stand only for you)
Over and on and on and on and on and on and
On and on and on and on and
On and on and on and on and on

Rollin' under the melody, rockin' over the beat
As I'm checkin' up on the rhythm and make
The whole sound sweet
Not like candy you taste that so you can be
YMCO music is good to the truth and you agree

Each for me and I for y'all
United we stand, divided we fall
One for all and all for one
United we stand, we'll get the job done
Each for me and I for y'all
United we stand, divided we fall
