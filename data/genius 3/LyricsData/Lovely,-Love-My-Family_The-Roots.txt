All we need, all we need, all need . . 
Spread the love around
Yeah

Sometimes when I am sitting by myself
Those quiet moments when not with no one else
I'm mesmerized by all the many good things in my life
I think about the time when I was younger
And the older that I get, the more that I feel wiser
With the love of friends and family
Get stronger, and it carries me on through

So, I say lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
Lovely, lovely, love my family
So, I say lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
Lovely, lovely, love my family

Sometimes when I am waiting for the bus
The sun shines bright, and I feel peace like nowhere else
I know I'm big and healthy, life keeps going, I keep moving, I'm alright
I go to school and educate my mind, and the way the world is spinning
Makes me want to turn around and start all over, hit the reset, and go back in time

Oh, baby, love me
Oh, spread the love around
Yeah

So, I say lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
Lovely, lovely, love my family
So, I say lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
Lovely, lovely, lovely, lovely
Lovely, lovely, love my family
