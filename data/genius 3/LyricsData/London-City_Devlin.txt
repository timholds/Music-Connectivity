[Intro]
Let your hair down in London City... everybody just keep
Moving with me
Let your hair down in London City... everybody just keep
Moving with me

Bud, sweat and beers!

And tonight we're in London city

[Verse 1]
I'm on the A13 on the way to the city, where the lights
Are bright with some boys that like to fight
I'm leaning. Out the window, smoking a spliffy
Through the wind in my eyes, like tears that I cry
Getting high on the essence of life
Cuz' tonight we're in London city. And I got bout' 400
Wit me...
15 minutes ago we left Barking, now we're approaching
The city, And Were laughing
Wanna hit a restaurant first cuz' I'm starving. Eat well for the start of emptying glasses. This is London
City
The best city in the world when everybodys not shanking
And blasting, young men moving to music and females
Shaking their asses

[Chorus] (x2)
Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep
Moving with me, just keep dancing with me, just keep
Rolling with me


[Verse 2]
Alright, I've finished my plate. Now I'm walking out
The restaurant, lighting up a cigarette and then I
Pass half to my mate
Many clubs and bars await. We're gonna drink and dance
Till' it's late
And my name is Bait, so a lotta young ladies wanna
Glance at my face. While they got a glass in their hand and
A wiggling their ass and their waist
It's the O.T show, sexy ladies who wind down low. And
If ya get approached by a bloke, that smells of weed
Smoke, don't act like you don't wanna know
Cuz' we got the city on smash. As the strobe lights
Flash, all I do is drink more champs and spend more
Cash... London City no match

[Chorus x2]
Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep
Moving with me, just keep dancing with me, just keep
Rolling with me

[Verse 3]
As the night comes to a closure I'm far from sober, but
I carry on drinking like a soldier, even when the night
Club's over
It's 3 in the morning and I still look smart but
I'm far from a poser. I'm sporting, Ralph Lauren
Lacoste, Lyle and Scott
I'm 19 with more greys than my Dad's got and your
Girls still trying to watch. Well I guess my face just
Lights up the spots
And now I'm pissed up running in the road, staggering
Looking for a cab back to Dagenham to kick back and
Cotch
With this sexy blue eyed brunnette girl that I got
Well a night in the capital it was more than a lot
London City just bop

[Chorus] (x2)
Let your hair down in London City, everybody just keep
Moving with me, just keep dancing with me, just keep
Rolling with me

[Outro]
... London City just bop
Let your hair down in London City...
