[Verse 1]
Do you have the time to listen to me whine?
About nothing and everything all at once
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

[Hook]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?

[Verse 2]
I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
Just quit my whining, â€˜cause it's bringing her down

[Hook]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just dumb?

[Bridge]
Grasping to control, so I better hold on

[Hook]
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?
