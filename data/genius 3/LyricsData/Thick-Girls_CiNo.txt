[Verse 1: CiNo]
Where my dogs at?
Where my cats at?
Where my groupies at?
No Kat Stacks
But I'm laughing at all you skinny chicks
With tiny ass legs, let me guess
She got a nice face and her hair alright
But that bitch is still flatter than a year old Sprite
And I ain't kiddin' nigga, I'm so cereal
She's so thin, she'll hula-hoop in a Cheerio
I like a fat ass, get a handful of it
Once you get to squeeze it in her pants, you'll love it
Shawty got more curves than a DNA strand
If I was rich and famous, I'd do 3 a day, man
Hurricane that punani
Make you wetter than a tsunami
If I get caught in it
I'll flow through it so you can't drown me
Crown me, I'm the king of tearin' it up
You can lick the tip
But it's better to fuck

[Hook: CiNo & Stiffler]
Thick girls are the finest
Riding on my dick bow down to your highness
Thick-thick girls are the finest
Riding on my dick bow down to your highness
Thick girls wanna go
They show up all in my show
Can't you really see
I want yo crazy ass on me

[Verse 2: Stiffler]
Hello world, I'm so far
My name's Stiffler cuz I go hard
I'm so raw, get the T-bone
I'm in the kitchen cooking with CiNo
We cold and spit heat
Cuz I'mma go loco on this beat
Thick girls are the finest
And thin girls are the tiniest
If she's behind a tree, I wouldn't see her like fog
That chick bony and bones are for dogs
Back to the thickness if you (Recall)
Found a thick bitch and I played her like (B-ball)
Saying "no" to me? (NO!)
Never that
She reminds me of Spalding, Never Flat
Ass round like a ball, I swear punk
With that said, my dick is the air pump

[Hook]

[Verse 3: CiNo & Stiffler]
All you thick girls!
Drop it down low
Drop it down low
Drop it down low
All you thick girls!
Drop it down low
Drop it down low
Drop it down low
Now bring it back up
(They bring it back up)
Bring it back up
(They bring it back up)

Now put it all up on me
I know I'm a little scrawny
But I'm stronger than an army
When I'm swinging my salami
Bitch!

[Hook]
