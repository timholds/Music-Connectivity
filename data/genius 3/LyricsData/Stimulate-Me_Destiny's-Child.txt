[Mocha]
Yo, that's what love will do, leave a chick gullible
Everything wonderful
Till he leaves from under you
Yea I seen it before
I dont need it no more
I'm overseas on tour, lettin my feet in the door
And for those niggas that'll try to scam stacks from me
Well that depends on how u handle my cat for me
Get afectionate and erectionate
But the less u trick, thats the less u get
There u go, I got impressions so stress on
U jus second best uhh
Stop second guess-on
U never listen, u can't stop it I'm on fire
Know that u goin leave out here wit your pockets lighter
[LaTavia]
Count a stack about a hundred grand, rubber bands
[Mocha]
I'm like your other hand, ain't no other man
Understand, not til I told u that, hold that
I dont want it if u can't hold back, know that

Verse 1:
[Beyonce]
Baby boy, I can see that you want me
But baby it ain't that easy
Take your time, do me right
You gotta work at me, cause I'm not that type (Baby)

Hook:
I need you to, stimulate me
You can have me
If you want me
I need you to, stimulate me
You can have me
If you want me

Verse 2:
[Kelly/LaTavia]
Take me out in the six
Lemme know that you wanna be up in my mix
You say you want my sweet body
But first you gotta pamper me
Say you gotta phat crib in the hills
Dont mean a thing to me
Unless I got the keys
If you said half goes to me (Tell me)

Rap:
(Male) Mami what u want from a playa like me
Out in the streets, livin O.C
(Mocha) Papi what u want from a honey like me
Ghetto sweet, hot dime piece
(Male) Pick u up from college and take u to my crib
We can max out, then hee hee hee hee
(Mocha) It sounds real sweet, but first we hit the mall
Shoppin sprees what u coppin me

Bridge (Over Hook):
I'll tell you what its all about
But first you gotta take me out
Promise me you will be good
Treat me like a balla should
