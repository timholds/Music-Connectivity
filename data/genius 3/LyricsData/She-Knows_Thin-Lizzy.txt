Who's got the funk when you're feeling low down
Who's going to love you when there's no one else around
Who's going to help you especially when you're sick
Mother Mary, I need you quick

She knows, and she gives her everything
She knows, but she can't do a thing
She knows, and she tries her best
She knows, oh you know she knows

Who's got the junk when you're feeling low down
Who's going to give when there's none to go around
Who's going to help you when you feel you've had enough
Mother Mary, this time it's rough

She knows, and she gives her everything
She knows, but she can't do a thing
She knows, and she tries her best
She knows, oh you know she knows

But Mother Mary, do you feel the pain?
I'm falling down and I can't get up again

Do you, do you, do you
Do you, do you, do you

Just a slide guitar injection

Who's got the junk when you're feeling low down
Who's going to help you when there's none to go around
Who's going to help you especially when you're ill
Loving Mary, I hope you will

She knows, and she gives her everything
She knows, but she can't do a thing
She knows, and she tries her best
She knows, oh you know she knows

But Mother Mary, do you feel the pain?
I'm falling down and I can't get up again

Mother Mary, is there nothing you can do?
