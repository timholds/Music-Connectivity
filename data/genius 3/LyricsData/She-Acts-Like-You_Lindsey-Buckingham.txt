Baby, look me in the eyes
Baby took me by surprise
She could never find the voice
That’s because she had no choice

She acts like you
She acts like you
Oh, so disinterested
All dressed up in blue

Baby never hears a sound
Baby never comes around
Had enough of all the toys
She sits alone above the noise

She acts like you
She acts like you
Oh, so disinterested
All dressed up in blue

I’d like to set her free
From everything I see
When she acts like me

She acts like you
She acts like you
Oh, so disinterested
All dressed up in blue

She acts like you
She acts like you
Oh, so disinterested
All dressed up in blue
All dressed up in blue
All dressed up in blue
