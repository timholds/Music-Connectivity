The woman she like to Rumba
The woman she like Calypso
The steel drums drive her crazy
And she can't seem to say no
She just can't seem to resist them, no

She's been drinking Jamaican rum
Dancing to the steel drums from the Caribbean
Drinking Jamaican rum
It's that West Indian rhythm

It was wild, it was wild
The night she came home drunk
She kicked in the door
And said lover you know what I want
Lover, give me what I want

She's been drinking Jamaican rum
And she's living with a black man
He's from the Caribbean
Drinking Jamaican rum
She's been drinking Jamaican rum
Dancing to the steel drums from the Caribbean
Drinking Jamaican rum
Rum and cola
It's very popular and it's twice as nice with ice
