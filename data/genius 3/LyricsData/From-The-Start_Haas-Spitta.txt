[Verse 1: Olu]
As you gettin older, get used to the cold shoulder
Thinkin that these niggas got your back, until they fuck you over
Don’t matter if its the streets, burbs, or the city borders
Them dead presidents that keep you from gettin ignored
Cuz money talks and its ironic
Same shit that get people to talkin bout ya
Stop being dishonest, as you flaunt it
The taller you walk, the more shit talkers there are
Most niggas only hate to see you on it…
They gon remember who got the stacks
But what you really should remember is who got your back
Yo don't be Helen Keller, unable to face the facts
Blind and misunderstood
But I figured I'd bounce back
With these middle fingers Im flickin like bics with flammable liquid
Finger fuckin a pencil and fluently writin lyrics
Saw the man in the mirror
He told me to keep it trilla
Im climbin top of these buildings and feelin like a gorilla
Right, yeah nigga you hear me tho
Cleveland nigga, do it for the tribe like Geronimo
Bout to fuck the world no condom though
Uncommon flow, I'm in another zone
I keep my goals wide, sometimes I flow high
But not with closed eyes, I never let em water
Right now Im chill in man
Crack a lager, bumpin Toro
But when Im not you know the shit I do is extra thorough

[Hook: Haas & Olu]
If life a bitch then she too short for me
Live fast die young I'm like drive slow homie
Dive slow homie
Ya never know when the angel might take ya soul homie
So when I go take this music as a ghost of me
We all do it for the art
So dont wait until I'm gone appreciate it from the start

[Verse 2: Haas]
RIP Robin Williams, every rapper claimin they the realist
I see you bitches in diguise, Mrs. Doubtfire
They say I'm too much to take in, just wait a second I'll make don't doubt fire
I'm the outlier overshadowed by the shade of brown on my arms
Remain calm when step up on the stage, I'm a set the crowd ablaze
We can throw the energy back n forth
Like we playin' pong with some Kamehamehas
Been at it 3 or 4 years n I won't stop til I'm the god
Spittin ayahs at the mosque
Til I make a true believer out of every single broad
Til they understand my mystic persona
Leave the industry in a coma with a brain hemorrhage
I'm an epidemic, ill as Ebola when I ride the beat
Flow ferocious - they'll never bottle me
If I'm wobbly on the stage tell em cut the nerves like lobotomy
All the homies tryna tell I ain't do it right
Well fuck a backseat driver I'm still in the driver seat
I'm sick of it that shit gon put me to sleep like Dramamine
I ain't with the drama see me up there in the armory
I'm the illiest, grab a racket launcher, blast off on my odyssey
Pakistani packing heat over beats
I know that's kinda odd to see
