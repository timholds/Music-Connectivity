“You might have forgotten what it feels like
But I’ll remember for you, I’ll remember”
Conversation, a footstep a floor up or floor down
Or down in the foyer mumbling, mumbling
Only the neighbors can hear the ringing of an unanswered telephone

He slouches solo
In his apartment
Before the TV
She boards the bus
Outside Chicago
There’s nothing but chicken bone
Poor on television

She counts up six stories and over three windows
Turns to the street to end or begin
Defrocked celebrities, dinner and a movie
No more new Jesus’
I’m corrupt, I won’t shut up
I’ve been over and over
This story is older than both of us
And I’m not forgiven, I won’t ask for it
Dear most sincerely forever truly yours

He slouches solo
In his apartment
Before the TV
She boards the bus
Outside Chicago
There’s nothing but chicken bone
Poor on television
