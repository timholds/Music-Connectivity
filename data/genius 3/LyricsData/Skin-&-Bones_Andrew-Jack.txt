We all love the face that God gave us,
We all see the twinkle in our own eyes
And I’ve been thinking hard my whole life
But I’m not afraid to gamble, roll dice
Whether you’re addicted to drugs,
Conflicted with love, drink for the buzz
Or think that you’re fucked -- things will look up
I find sensational thrills in inspirational chills
And, that’s cool, you have organizational skills
Well, I’m happy for you -- I really am --
But my life’s a sappy story starring a silly man
I tried to stay stimulated,
Because there was nothing worse than reality
So I tend to put on an animated personality
We didn’t walk the same path
I have lost more than I could ever gain back
I am not rich
I’ve never had hors d’oeuvres
And to go to school I had to put myself in debt
I’m not here to repeat the same four words
Until they're stuck in your head
I want to be a game changer
But up until now my luck’s been hanging by a thread
All I really know is I’ll be creating until I’m dead
Some people spend their whole life
Figuring out what they already are
They say, “You have to pay your dues
If you want to be a star.”
I think it’s sad when I see
People giving up on their dreams
To work in a factory.
So it seems it’s how it has to be
Human nature lacks biodiversity
If you want to get a job, go to university
Like it hurts to be original
But i’d rather be broke and unconditional
Than wealthy and miserable
We’re all born with the spirit in which we inherit
I don’t make art to sell, I just want to share it
Me and my brothers were troublemakers,
My mom couldn’t get through to us.
Then my teachers realized I was different,
But I always knew I was.
My only memories of my dad
Are Mickey Mouse stuff-y
In a collage on my wall
I used to think I was unlucky
Now I think no blessing is too small
I’ve never been comfortable,
Always hungry for more
Grew up, the youngest of four
But I was still alone with my thoughts
So I thought that I would give it all that I got
My mission will never vary
Art is what I bleed
Only true visionaries will succeed
Because I’m not after money
Fuck greed
I don’t really think that they understand me
I think about my life, where it is, and how it can be
I’m blocking out the bullshit, I’m proceeding peacefully
This is for the people who believed in me
This is for my father, who had dreams for me
To develop, someone has to imagine
Progression requires passion
This world’s so fucked, change needs to happen
I try to be affable, but they think I’m a nuisance
I don’t know math at all, so I thought I was stupid
I see things differently
Our views differ, but don’t resent me
You see, when I think about the world
I see the earth as a cell
The atmo-, hydro-, and lithosphere
Allow life to excell
Mother Nature is omniscient, assuring that all is well
When the system isn’t efficient, chaos will swell
Natural disasters present danger, but keep order in check
Nature isn’t fueled by anger and has no regret
And when it helps you, it doesn’t hold you in debt
My friends and family thought that I was depressed
But I was just a little self-pitiful
Yeah, I believe in the Bible
But only as a concept, I don’t take it too literal
Creating my own millennium, my life isn’t a gold run
I’m as good as anyone, but I’m better than no one
And this part of my thesis is hard to explain
If I said we all possess pieces of Jesus,
You would think I was insane
But what if I told you we're already in heaven
And hell is in your brain?
Because nature is beauty and judgement brings strain
Society is twisted, but we’re all to blame
It’s like nobody’s human when Facebook’s our name
Half the population is egotistical and pessimistic
The standard is hypocritical and materialistic
Too bad my grasp of reality flushed my swag down the drain
I am an analytical misfit who shall remain the same as I came
Skin & bones through the game
You either worked for it or were born into it
And even though innocence sits in the syndicate
Carcinogen is imminent within the kids
This isn’t the revolution, it’s the intrinsic switch
