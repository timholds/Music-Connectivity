I met a stranger*
He had fire in his eyes
I met a pretty angel
But she was like too dead inside
Then I met a bunch of children
With no food to eat or no place to hide
So I tried to get away now
But there's nothing in the world that can keep me in the skies
So if you ever happen to bump into God
Please ask Him if he made this all up for fun
C'mon

[Chorus:]
Don't keep it waiting
You've got nothing to lose
The world is fading
You've got nothing to prove
Finally it all comes crushing down to the earth
Finally we get what we deserve
I met a preacher
He had heart but he was blind
Then I met another homeless
Who sold his soul for less than a dime
So i opened up the papers
But there were rats and painted lies
So i looked up to the sky and I smiled
And realized how small we are
Yeah, So if you ever happen to bump in to God
Please ask Him if he made this all up for fun
Don't keep it waiting
You've got nothing to lose
The world is fading
You've got nothing to prove
Finally it all comes crushing down to the earth
Finally we get what we deserve
Get what we deserve, get what we deserve
Yeah, f**k my french
This is so ridiculous
I'm a product of God
Still there's poison in my blood
I find it cynical how things are critical
We better breakout before we blackout
Raise your voice
Don't let them break you down
All depends on what you do
It's a state of mind
Free the youth
Don't let them break you down
(Ooohhhh)
All depends on what you do
It's a state of mind
This boxing ring
Ain't big enough
For the two of us
So hold your ground
(Don't look down)
One wrong move and you'll
Taste the ground
Taste the ground
Oh-oh
We are the new generation
Oh-oh
We have to rebuild the nation
Oh-oh
We are the new generation
Oh-oh
We have to rebuild the nation
Finally, finally, finally
We get what we deserve
