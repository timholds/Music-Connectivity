[Intro]
I feel like...you wake up in the morning...
Like a Saturday morning and the sun's comin' through the window
You're feelin' real right. That's a blessing. Any day you can wake up
You can't waste a second, can't waste a minute
Definitely not an hour. You got one life to live

[Verse 1]
Till Jesus come back and prove that fact
We only live once so go and get yo stack
You can take a picture but you can't take it back
Life ain't in VHS, we can't rewind that
Get a pain in your chest and it just might be a wrap
Six Feet Under like the show and that's that
Tomorrow don't exist 'til you wake up in it
Time ain't dependable, don't wait for a minute
Cause life has seldom ever been a faithful bitch
See she love to flirt with death, can't keep a relationship
So therefore, I'm a player for life
Live everyday like a bachelor
Fuck a wife
You got a dream baby, go on and dream it
But wake up if you sleepin', that's the wrong place to see it
You gotta be alive, survive and strive to be it
I walk a path of blind faith but need no eye dog to see it

[Hook]
I ain't go no wealth but I got my health
It's a gift to wake up, time to better myself
See the sun in the sky
Feelin' like I can fly up that high
I'll never let another day pass me by
Win or lose but at least Lord I try
It's time to smile, ain't no tears left to cry
Somehow, someway I'll get by
Everyday

[Verse 2]
Ain't nothin' in life guaranteed but death
So why debate about that, it's a waste of breath
Fuck what you spend, it's about what you got left
There's no alphabetical order, no tellin' who's next
Rollin' past the cemetery knowin' I'm blessed
Yeah life's hard but I prefer the stress
Cause that headstone's harder when you're a permanent guest
We can all be deceased, I don't mind being depressed
Any day's a good day, even one's that weren't the best
On the freeway that could be me in a fatal car wreck
Plane crash, gun blast, cancer in my chest
And still even then you got a fightin' chance
So don't stop movin' til the end of the dance
And when the music stops make the beat with your hands
I'mma kick this real shit until I kick the can
Just cause we do, life don't have to stick to a plan

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Who am I?
The answers much deeper
For now let's just say I'm your motivational speaker
Street surgeon general for ghetto individuals
Feelin' like Chernobyl when you're almost in critical
I can't turn water into wine, make a miracle
But I can spit a rhyme to make your life more livable
Conjoined twins feel the same pain, there's struggle's identical
Like Tomax and ?, I've been where you finna go
If I don't change a life what the fuck I'm rappin' fo'?
This ain't the W but I can open the do'
The rest is on you, you better know what to do
Chances don't come with instructions, if any very few
Opportunity knocks and seldom calls
It will pass you By like Pharcyde if you ain't on the ball
No guts no glory with my back on the wall
Whatever life might throw, I'll be ready to brawl

[Outro]
I ain't go no wealth but I got my health
It's a gift to wake up, time to better myself
See the sun in the sky
Feelin' like I can fly up that high
I'll never let another day pass me by
Win or lose but at least Lord I try
It's time to smile, ain't no tears left to cry
Somehow, someway I'll get by
Everyday
