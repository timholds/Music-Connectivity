The friendly ranger paused
And scooping a bowl of beans
Spreading them like stars
Falling like justice on different scenes

"I'm damned"
"Indeed, comrade"
"I'm being bombed"
And all the people's faces turned strawberry blonde

By the morning gate the friendly ranger waits
For the sun making sure it's not late
"Just in time" "No need to fear" "Well, just in case"
And all the people are happy for another year

And in the evening shade he climbs upon the sun
Getting it's glow
He goes on
Singing this song

To feel the goodness glowing inside
To walk down the street with my arms about your hips
Side by side
To play with a sad eyed child till he smiles
To look at a starry sky at night, realize the miles

To see the sunset behind the steeple
Clontarf Castle, no King, Queen or knightly people
A coal fire and it's pouring rain
To wave goodbye to a very good friend
Never meet again
Little thoughts bring
Little memories
Of you to me
