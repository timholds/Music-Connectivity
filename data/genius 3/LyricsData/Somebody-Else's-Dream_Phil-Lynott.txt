Damn, damn
Damn, damn
Damn, damn

First he comes up and he tells ya
Hey I'm bored with the whole musical scene
And then he says, I've seen your act
It's the greatest thing

But the more he gets to know ya
The more he shows ya he's off the lunatic fringe
You see as silly as it seems
I'm so tired of living out somebody else's dream

Who do you think you are
Are you a poet a lover a father a rock and roll star
Who do I think I am
Who do I think I am
I love my partner in life - my wife, my children and mam

Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are
Well I messed up, I mucked up oh I should shut up
Who do you think you are
Who do you think you are
Who do I think I am

You mean a thousand different faces
But it's that same old reclaim
And a thousand different places
Don't you know home?
Let me introduce you to who I mean

Then you get impatient
Then you start to scream
You see as silly as it seems
You're living out somebody else's dream
You're living out someone else's dream
You're living out somebody else's dream
You're living out somebody else's dream
You're living out somebody else's dream
So tired of it
Of living

And people say
It must be nice to be noticed
And you say
It don't affect me at all
But some day this pretending it must stop
And you must protest do the people have the right to know it all
Do they know it all?
Are they told it all
Do you know it all?
I don't know at all
As silly as it seems

What did that mean?
I mean it was a fob a flash a scheme
What do you mean?
You're living out someone elses dream
What does that mean?

It means I dont know man
I'll never do this again
You're living out someone else's dream
You're living out someone else's dream

Who says this song has anything in common with you at all
That's what I mean
You mean as silly as it seems
I'm so tired of living out somebody else's dream
