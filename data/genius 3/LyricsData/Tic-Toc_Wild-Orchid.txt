Sometimes when two people meet
You know that undeniably
There can be an instant chemistry
Do you feel the magic here with me
Ohh, let's not wait
No need to hesitate
Better find out before it's too late

Tic toc look at the clock
Love is just a moment away
Don't stop, make my world rock
Come closer don't make me wait
Tic toc the doors are all locked
Love is just a moment away

Never gonna stop
Gonna make you rock
To the rhythm of the Tic Toc

Longing for those sleepless nights
Sunday morning lazy days and candlelight
The anticipation drives me wild
Fantasies they just won't leave my mind
Ohh let's not wait
Destiny said this is fate
Just imagine what we could create

Tic toc look at the clock
Love is just a moment away
Don't stop, make my world rock
Come closer don't make me wait
Tic toc the doors are all locked
Love is just a moment away

All night long
Never gonna stop
Gonna make you rock
To the rhythm of the Tic Toc
Feel the rhythm of the Tic Toc
Just hold on
Take it nice and slow
Wanna make it slow
Like the rivers and the oceans go
Feel the current deep down below
We'll be free
It's a mystery
Wondering what will be
Fortune tellers are telling me
In the crystal ball they can see
You and me

Ohh, time keeps ticking away
It goes by so fast
Let's live in the moment, let's make this love last

Tic toc look at the clock
Love is just a moment away
Don't stop, make my world rock
Come closer don't make me wait
Tic toc the doors are all locked
Love is just a moment away
