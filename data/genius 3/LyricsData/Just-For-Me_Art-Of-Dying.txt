Forget what you've been told, they're inside your home
Staring back at you through every screen
Listening to you talk, eyes on every block
They know where you are and where you've been

You're beeing tracked, hacked, you're under attack
They see, they hear, fear and they steer you
This ain't for them to see
They use, abuse, try and acuse you

This ain't for them to see
It's just for you, just for me
Just for you, just for me
Don't sign your rights away for false security

Surrendering your soul to the masses
Fight for secrecy, leave a legacy where freedom isn't
Burned to ashes
You're beeing tracked, hacked, you're under attack

They see, they hear, fear and they steer you
This ain't for them to see
They use, abuse, try and acuse you
This ain't for them to see
It's just for you, just for me
Just for you, just for me

You've gone insane, your time is fading
We're not the lamb, you're not the shepherd
The blood on your hand won't make it better
Out time has come to take up the reigns

If you believe in god it's time to pray
They see, they hear, fear and they steer you
This ain't for them to see
They use, abuse, try and acuse you

This ain't for them to see
It's just for you, just for me
Just for you, just for me
