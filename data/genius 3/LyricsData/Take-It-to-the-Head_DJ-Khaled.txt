[Intro: DJ Khaled]
Working all winter
Shining all summer
I ain't no beginner
You scared to—

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Take it to the head, yeah, yeah
Don’t think about it, be about it
Don’t be scared to take it to the head, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, you fly but if I tell you then you might take it to the head
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I’m gone
Take it to the head
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I’m gone
Now we gon’ get fucked up, no excuses no apologies

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Reputation for Gs, that's the role of a boss
So amazin' to see, black baguettes in my watch
She say love is for free, just expensive to shop
But it's nothin' to me, that extends from my block
I got a lot of figures, I’m a father figure
She know a lot of niggas, don’t know a hotter nigga
Come to the winners circle, a lot of men will hurt you
But I’m here to nurture, I wanna take you further
She got all them purses, I say in my verses
YSL and Hermes and barely scratch the surface
She know on purpose, as I peel the curtains
I always make her nervous, this record’s perfect

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Take it to the head, yeah, yeah
Don’t think about it, be about it
Don’t be scared to take it to the head, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, you fly but if I tell you then you might take it to the head
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I’m gone
Take it to the head
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I’m gone
Now we gon’ get fucked up, no excuses no apologies

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, reputation for bustin’, pussy open, it’s nothin’
Big fat nigga, all that huffin’ and puffin’
Take me shopping in France and he pay in advance
He got big balls, ran a play in his pants
Ran away with his money just to chill on the Island
All my bitches is stylin’, beaches and eatin' Italian
This is real shit, real shit
On the real, nigga fuckin’ with a real bitch
I ride for him, DMV
Stamina, GNC
3 letters CMB
Competition, I don’t see any

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Take it to the head, yeah, yeah
Don’t think about it, be about it
Don’t be scared to take it to the head, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, you fly but if I tell you then you might take it to the head
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I’m gone
Take it to the head
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I’m gone
Now we gon’ get fucked up, no excuses no apologies

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Reputation for tastin’
I’m killin’ ‘em hoes like Jason
Girl, that pussy like medication to patients
Got my eyes closed, like Asian persuasion
Fuck with me baby, it’s Tunechi, baby
Buss a nut, smoke a blunt, now I’m rejuvenated
With all that pink on, bitch, I’m King Kong
I eat her ice cream, she eat my ice cream cone
Pop a pill and pop that pussy
I bet you Tunechi make her throw away that silver bullet
And she kiss me on my neck and she kiss me on my chest
And then she…

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Take it to the head, yeah, yeah
Don’t think about it, be about it
Don’t be scared to take it to the head, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Girl, you fly but if I tell you then you might take it to the head
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I’m gone
Take it to the head
I’m in my zone, damn near got my eyes closed
One shot, two shots, I’m gone
Now we gon’ get fucked up, no excuses no apologies

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Young Mula Baby!
