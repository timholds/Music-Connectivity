It's daybreak and I'm still awake
Don't your memory ever sleep at night?

Another night like the night before
When I get home..I'm not alone
'Cause your memory greets me at the door
I go to bed to get away from my thoughts
But when I want to sleep, your memory just wants to talk
Don't your memory ever sleep at night?

It never lets me out of itâ€™s sight
It goes from room to room turning on the lights
Don't your memory ever sleep at night
Don't your memory ever sleep at night?

Your memory keeps reminding me
How good love used to be
Oh, it keeps me good company
That's all that's left between you and me
I go to bed but I know I can't rest
'Cause that's when your memory's at it's heart breaking best
Don't your memory ever sleep at night?

It never lets me out of it's sight
It goes from room to room turning on the lights
Don't your memory ever sleep at night
Don't your memory ever sleep at night?

It goes from room to room turning on the lights
Don't your memory ever sleep at night?
Don't your memory ever sleep at night?...
