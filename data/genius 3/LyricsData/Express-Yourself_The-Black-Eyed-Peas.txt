Express yourself!
Girl let it all hang out!
Just do your thang!
Nothin' to worry about!

[Verse 1: Will.i.am]
Let's do it (let's do it)
What do you think to try? (to try)
Drop down your lane and go! (weeerrr)
Go where you please no limits
There are no limits for your infinite
We break it through the boundaries
If you wanna be anything better be free
Like number 7 on the first LP
Yeah I thought I told you that the Peas don't stop...

Though, we keep it UVE though folks
May not get it the first time around
I stick to my sound cuz I'm gonna remain
An individual like a single lane
And be a leader like the first one who came
I put the flag down, don't put your head down
Ladies and gents cuz you could do the same

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
All my ladies just move your body
To the sound of deliberate, parties
And if you wanna party just pump the party!
The filipino-black man from p.e pan!
And hit you with a (sigh) that makes you wanna (ohh)
Don't hold it back show and prove!
C'mon just let it all hang out in a groove (ahhh ahhh)
The Peas gonna get you in the mood

Man, it's gon' be fat

Let yourself go and and show em' where ya at
Do what you want and don't hold back
So girl, do whatever you wanna do

Do whatever you wanna do (do now) and just…
