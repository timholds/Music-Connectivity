[Verse 1]
You might really be
The very best woman to ever suit me
But I can't expect you to see how I see
'Cause sometimes I don't see a thing
But personal pressure is making me guess
My time's running out as we're both getting dressed
I don't know who's body I'd rather feel pressed
But I cannot arrest on my thoughts

[Chorus]
'Cause we had a good time
Then it was sorrow
I call it stealing
You call it borrow
So I want my heart back
If you're not gonna keep it
If you've got no uses
Then I'm gonna need it
And someone else is gonna need it too

[Verse 2]
While some of it's here
I'm wondering where did the rest disappear
The parts that I thought were the best are unclear
Or hiding there under your doubt
So maybe we'll call this a hard lesson leanred
But you're holding something that I'll need returned
If you need some time
I've got some to burn
But burning is just running thin

[Chorus]
'Cause we had a good time
Then it was sorrow
I call it stealing
You call it borrow
So I want my heart back
If you're not gonna keep it
If you've got no uses
Then I'm gonna need it
And someone else is gonna need it too

[Bridge]
What would the point be
If we let this thing drag out
Failing to accept
These impressions passed around
Oh, you and I
It's been a wild ride
And I wouldn't change at all
But I'm gonna let you know

[Chorus]
We had a good time
Then it was sorrow
I call it stealing
You call it borrow
So I want my heart back
If you're not gonna keep it
If you've got no uses
Then I'm gonna need it
And someone else is gonna need it too
