Verse 1:
They saw nothin but my outline
The silhouette of an outcast a glimmer shooting over the skyline
Supernova superstar supervillain
Supercharged lyricism it’s the Dylan of our time
So diligent the sting of my superstition
Within the shit that I’m spittin’ that it’s giving em bad signs
New decision was to assume the position of idol inside this new religion
It was written in the street soul scripture
So never sell out the street unless the people in the streets roll wit ya
I lose more sleep with each cold winter
Seeing em act a fool to achieve gold quicker
But as these polls pick up
I’m still tryin to make a name for myself like a deed poll switch up
Fake rap candy snap bitches get lit up
Live on stage over a sample and a kick drum

Verse 2:
Live motherfuckers up and running again
Mantreezy done done it again, Vegas up in the blend
The last kids you wanna be fuckin with friend
See I’m learnt from my mistakes I‘m only fuckin’ with friends
Keep my business in the family, music in the headphones
Nose to the stone as I walk through the dead zone
Manifesto was clear from the get go
Now I got a couple billion people to let know
Take one of the worlds best kept secrets
And play it on ya PA speakers
Bump it for the humans and the rest of god’s creatures
Take it all the way to the hard to see bits of the outer reaches
Fuck it if you out there we gon’ reach yas
Speak to y’all frankly with nothin short of genius, Believe this, we charismatic as world leaders, Before Mantra takes his machete to they’re features

Verse 3:
Original aim was slaughter the underground
Take my seat at the table as lord of the underground
Some cats were snoring before but they love it now
Clapping so loud I’m hearing applause in the thunderclouds
There’s more to discover now, I ain't coming down at all
Somebody gotta make me fall
But on the day I do happen to draw the short straw
Then I’ll draw my long-sword and torture all y’all, (lot sure)
I implore you to take a minute to dig it
This rap gig is less of a racket or meal ticket
It's a one way trip, origin unknown
Destination undecided yet we rarely uninspired, People never unexcited if the flight visit they City and kick it in they dominion
We follow meridian lines, giving breath to inquisitive minds
Until its time, back on the Circuit like RAAAAAA!
