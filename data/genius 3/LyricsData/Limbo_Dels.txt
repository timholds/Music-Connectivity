[Verse 1: Dels]
I wear my heart on my sleeve, kidney in a tumbler
Drowning I can't breathe, don't take me under
We'll never move on, things will never be the same
Playing that blame your favourite number
Ghosts in Limbo, we're drifting past
Blinded by lights shots fired in the dark
Nothing will stop these, these hunger pains
Tracing that black matter in your veins

[Bridge: Dels]
Just like you...
I'm in the dark, just like you, you
Yeah, Iâ€™m in the dark, just like you
I'm in the dark, just like you, you
