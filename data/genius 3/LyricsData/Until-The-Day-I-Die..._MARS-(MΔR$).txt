[Verse 1: MÎ”R$]

Merely a spawn or reflection of my father's rap collection
With a little bit of everything like a walking rapping section
I'm coming from all angles
Battle in my mind, good and evil like falling angels
It's hard to stay on this straight road
But I'm straight and narrow, lyrical bow and arrow
Paper chasing, tryna' get that dough like I'm Sbarro
Cause heaven knows all we chase in life is that dinero
Selling crack to pregnant mothers as long as we got that payroll
Coming in, come again
College got me coming out of pocket like I'm Michael Vick
Not a cent, so I take this mic and vent
In hopes that someone likes this shit
And if not then it's back to the lab again, I'm a scientist
They say hip-hop is dead I feel we've just abandoned it
So I mix these black thoughts with these roots here and plant it in
On a quest for love you can travel through my phrenology
And probably see a God MC, I'm like a walking prophecy
Yo, I'm a savior, no one to do it greater
I'm cut from an iller nature, dictionary demonstrator
That'll take you cartoons out the box, an illustrator
Ha, I'm gifted greater than anyone you can name up
So this is how we chill from 93 'til
Infinity or 95 until the end of me
I flow with entities over these instrumentals B
And influentially kill these niggas with verbal symmetry
I could tell you everything ain't what it seems
I struggle to face reality tryna' get back to dreams
It seems, this art is all I need
They say music is life but this rap shit is what I bleed
And I hope you see that I don't do this for the glory
I'd much rather tell my story through the shit that I'm recording
And they keep saying, "You just doing what the rest do"
But this music is reflection of self so F you
This self-reflection is just a lesson in effervescence
Headed to the top, I got no time for your second guessing
Either you with me or against me
So run with my squad or get run over quickly
I swear I go to this for inspiration listen for motivation
This is soul rejuvenating when my mind starts racing
And the problems that I'm facing tend to increase in the pace
And my mind starts decaying
Cause I stay frustrated just a little bit
By the little shit but I'ma make it if you feelin' it
So free your mind and you better check the time
Cause I came to take your shine AKA what's really mine
So could you stay with me or maybe pray with me
As I travel A to Z or even from A to B
Shit, it's plain to see that everything ain't what it seems
So I take this seed and plant it in the mind of teens

[Bridge]

Yo, until the day I die I'ma ride to the sky with the same old vibe
Yea, until the day I die I'ma ride to the sky with the same old vibe
Yo, until the day I die I'ma ride to the sky with the same old vibe
Yea, until the day I die, until the day I die...go
