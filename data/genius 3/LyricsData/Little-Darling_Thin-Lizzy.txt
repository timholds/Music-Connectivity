Little darling, gonna be a rock and roll star
Little darling, gonna play electric guitar
Little darling, I'd like to get to know you
Pleased to meet you, how do you do?

Little darling
Little darling
Little darling
Little darling

Little darling, gonna love you tonight
Little darling, gonna shake, shake, boogaloo
Little darling, can I rattle my bones and dance with you?
And later on there'll be some lovie dovin'

A little kissing
A little hugging
A little holding you

Little darling, what's your mama mama going to do?
Little darling, when she finds out I stayed out all night with you?
Little darling, I'm gonna miss kissing you
Little darling, I'm gonna miss kissing you

Little darling
Little darling
Little darling
Little darling

Little darling, gonna love you tonight
