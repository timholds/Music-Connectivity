[Verse 1]
Dark Whiskey Tequila Shots
Heart Breakers Forget Me Nots
Good Smoke Beat Up Boots
That’s How We Roll That’s What We Do
Que Paso Hey Pard Yo Yo
Play Back In Black Set Em Up Joe
Miss Tejas Puttin On A Show
All Lit Up in The Neon Glow

[Chorus]
Cowgirls Rock n Roll
Tattoos and Pick Up Trucks
Cowboys Country Songs
Cold Beer The Good Stuff
Got a Buzz Gotta Drawl Got a Twang
Got a Bite Like Copperhead Fangs
Cowgirls Rock and Roll
Tattoos and Pickup Trucks

[Verse 2]
Tall One At The Bar She Was Raised On A Farm
Goth Black Ponytail Ink On Her Arm
Out Here In The Way Back
Doing Things She Shouldn't Be Doing Like That
Ghost Of Hank Still Hanging On
Snoop and Willie Keep Singing That Song
Brown Jar Liquor Got A Shotgun Kick
Got It Going On Out Here In The Sticks

[Chorus]
