[Hook: Kano]
On a level, I'm a rebel
I ain't the same, I'm special
I'm from space Extraterrestrial
Give me some Bass
Give me some Treble
On a level, I'm a rebel
I ain't the same, I'm special
I'm from space Extraterrestrial
Give me some Bass
Give me some Treble

[Verse 1: Scorcher]
Ghetts hollered at me told me get up on this remix
Hit em with the winner flow lay off all the sweetness
So I'm going Everest so you know I'm peaking
Leader of the new school so you know I'm teaching
(What you teaching?)
Little nigga how to put their clothes on
How to write their lyrics if the flows wrong
Had to hop on ya feature like it's ya own song
Had these niggas screwing up their face, nose job
Yea look
Ya girlfriends favorite
Dressed for the occasion
If I don't make money then yes I make a statement
Not in the station
You man are thinking in the box I escape it
On another level call me spot in a spaceship
Keys to the city but it's locked so I break in
These man are stealing my style it's like their burgularing
Sounds like me but I ain't even heard of him
Yea ok
Sky in the building!
Blowing up like a 911 flight
In the building I'll be going harder till the day that I make a million
Even if I never spend it then I do it for my children
Cause I'm on another level
Mummy said I'm special
Right after she said it she said go put on the kettle
It's like I'm getting too sick for the sidewalk
So I'm gonna take a trip
Skywalk!

[Verse 2: Kano]
Yeah, let the beat build bitch
We ain't fucking with them farts this is real shit
We do exactly what we say Ronseal tin
Yeah that's stimpy's bredrin in the fridge yeah chilled Ren!
Ha
This tracks a flow temple
Yea we get that bread and cheese like I'm the breville
Talking bout flows
I got several
In fact!
You can gimme dat Rock
You can gimme dat Pop
You can gimme dat Metal
Boateng silk clean cut like Dettol
3.4 ya niggas couldn't afford the Petrol
Meep Meep
Roadrunner gone again
Hollywood?
Nah I'm like credits I'm on the ends
Sweet dreams
Because I spun them then I tucked em in
Agents coming after me but they don't know I've come for them
Matrix number one for them G brought out the big guns for them
No direction Tom Tom for them
It's that time of the month for them
Bitch
Wait
The beats still building
No suede shoes
But nigga Kano's left the building
Na I'm back again
This is G-H bitch and I'm a rep until the end

[Verse 3: Wretch 32]
3-2, they're calling me the finest Wretch
Under 10 stone I be carrying the title best
Undisputed champ where number one ain't gotta fight again
One day I'm a be a millionaire should I phone a friend
And tell em teach me how to dougie and no I can't dance
But I can move my mummy
And I can move my sister but they won't go
Ca they're both nosy and they riot on their roads
I guess they're both stuck in the hood like myself
In the pursuit of happiness and Wills wealth
I ain't saying that I'm rich but I'm doing well
I don't do fake hype I just do real sales
Sold units ain't never kissed Uranus
Just mingled with the stars and chilled up on the play list
Alien nation
Nations of aliens
Well tell the government to put us in our place then
Never put a finger on a brother that I ride with
Ca I put money on the hand that you write with
Call it a write off cause I'm doing my job
Phone my accountant that's a tax write off
Brother I divide gwop and share it with my people
None of my dargs could've ever turn Siegel
It's as real as it gets
That's why you still see me with Ghetts
Big heart don't worry bout my chest
It's the Wretch

[Verse 4:Ghetts]
UFO sighting
It's J. Clark in the matt black spacecraft
I park on Mars and do it with no license
These rappers keep talking bout fly
They wouldn't have a clue on what to do with no pilot
The only time they seen a G4 in the air is when I open up the window and thrown a studio item
I'm on a mad one you know I'm hyping
Telescope just so I can remember home
I let em know that where I come from there ain't no telephone
So easy they don't wanna make no calls
You know they don't wanna let I'm go
I was sent below with a second load
With the weapons and the rest of my own...
Kind
Screaming I have arrived
I – I- I – I have arrived
It's the motherfucking general
You're watching like it's Senegal
I just wanna eat and everybody's edible
Tryna kill me will result in your own burial
Ya bars are pants your flows terrible
But I'm lying you deserve no pedestal
So I kick away the legs and watch a bredda fall
Alien I ain't the same as them
I got two brains, one cranium
Plus I'm light-years ahead
All these cowboys I'm buzz Lightyear to them
