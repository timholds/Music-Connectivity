[Verse 1: Scorcher]
I ain't never put no work up in my nose
And I ain't got no job, I put work in on my crow
My darg hit me up like he's got a bit of D left
But he's running out of light, though
So I put the lights on, and then I put the light on
I told my girl "I'll be right back"
It's man's city like Maikon
Get it? Right back, man's city, Maikon
I'm on fire when the mic's on
No lie when the mic's on
I've got spot kinda OT, come through
Then the queue's like a mile long
I push work out with my Nikes on, same way
Might re-up two times on the same day
12 in the night, that's a payday
I want the money on time, no mate rate

[Hook: Rocket]
This one's all about cash, rent get stashed
Yeah? Man don't act too flash
Us man are putting in work
Dem man are out on the lash
Us man, us man been down in the dungeon
Cooking that pungent, man got a brand new batch
So don't act too gassed
No, don't act too gassed, yo
This one's all about cash, rent get stashed
Yeah? Man don't act too flash
Us man are putting in work
Dem man are out on the lash
Us man, us man been down in the dungeon
Cooking that pungent, man got a brand new batch
So don't act too gassed
Nah, don't act too gassed

[Verse 2: Rocket]
All day everyday, man tryna get that gwop and skrilla
Where I'm from, man don't squirrel
Been through the hard times, grew up on the curb side
Ain't just forest on the hill
South of the river, goes down in the bits, yeah?
Ain't only just time they kill
Man don't know about Jack and Jill
Dun know more trap and trill
24/7, I'm up
Cooking up a storm, shit getting fried up
Tell 'em that they better wise up
Can't fill my shoes, nah, I'm a size up
When they doubt us, tell 'em line up
Haters in the frame when the PAP aim
Had a little bit of name till the whole gang came
Had five minutes of fame, but now time's up

[Bridge: Scorcher & Rocket]
I ain't never sprayed no verse that I ain't wrote
We ain't got the same flow, I came first, brudda, take note
Look, we ain't got the same goals, we ain't in the same lane
I don't follow fashion, brother, change clothes
Got your girlfriend down, bare shells in the tank
Put the record sales in the bank
Cuh dis one's all about you know what
So don't ask why I do not stop

[Hook: Rocket]
This one's all about cash, rent get stashed
Yeah? Man don't act too flash
Us man are putting in work
Dem man are out on the lash
Us man, us man been down in the dungeon
Cooking that pungent, man got a brand new batch
So don't act too gassed
No, don't act too gassed, yo
This one's all about cash, rent get stashed
Yeah? Man don't act too flash
Us man are putting in work
Dem man are out on the lash
Us man, us man been down in the dungeon
Cooking that pungent, man got a brand new batch
So don't act too gassed
Nah, don't act too gassed
