[Phil Lynott]
I remember Paris in '49
The Champs Elysee, Saint Michel
And old Beaujolais wine
And I recall that you were mine
In those Parisienne days

[Gary Moore and Phil Lynott]
Looking back at the photographs
Those summer days spent outside corner cafes
Oh, I could write you paragraphs
About my old Parisienne days
