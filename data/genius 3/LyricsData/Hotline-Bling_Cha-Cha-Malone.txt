[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you needed my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling, yeah
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 1]
Ever since I left the city, you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl, you got me down, you got me stressed out
‘Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone, oh
Late night when you needed my love
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling, yeah
That can only mean one thing

[Verse 2]
Late night when you needed my love
I was always down to let it happen baby
Call me crazy, I’ve been cravin’
A little bit of that throwback roleplayin’
But you’re gone now
I think I need to move along
I promise I ain’t holdin’ on
Trust (Me), I know this is wrong
Now you roll around with a different set of hittas
Now you need some crowd just to go on out and kick it
I miss that sound when I used to go and hit it
Oh girl, that was the real shit
I just want that real shit
Time and time up in the air
Out there tryna get that paper
You thought I didn’t care, but
We was out here tryna start this label
You probably left because you needed someone to treat you right
Now all I see is photos of you turnin’ up every single night

[Hook]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you needed my love
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
And I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling, yeah
That can only mean one thing
