How could you do this to me?
How could you do this to we?
I put my trust in you
That's what you're supposed to do
How could you tell all those lies
While you're looking dead straight in my eyes?
You're someone I thought I knew
She must have thought so too
Before I say goodbye

Just tell me why did I give just a little bit more
And take just a little bit less
And try just a little bit harder
When it's all just wasted love
Why did you kiss me that way?
Why did you stay?
Now it's all just wasted love

Looking back now it's all making sense
When you said she was only a friend
Friends who were making love
Was it worth breaking up?
All the answers I don't want to know
I'll keep asking for after I go
The flowers they came too late
You've turned the love to hate
It's your turn now to cry

Just tell me why did I give just a little bit more
And take just a little bit less
And try just a little bit harder
When it's all just wasted love
Why did you kiss me that way?
Why did you stay?
Now it's all just wasted love

We can try and lie, but we both know
Too many things have changed
The memory of her in your arms
Is driving me insane
The shattered dream just breaks my heart
I can't go on this way
I will never look at you the same way
You wear a different face

Just tell me why did I give just a little bit more
And take just a little bit less
And try just a little bit harder
When it's all just wasted love
Why did you kiss me that way?
Why did you stay?
Now it's all just wasted love
