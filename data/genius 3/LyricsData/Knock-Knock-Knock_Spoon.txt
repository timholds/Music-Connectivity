[Verse 1]
All lines are read, the film is done
After Hours is on and now they'll make another one
If you miss the meaning this time
Well here comes another one

[Verse 2]
And if you clap your hands, the man will fall
Hold your breath, he'll shake himself to death
And the scenes get rearranged
And words unsaid

[Chorus]
Every day, I hear "knock knock knock"
Oh and it's you
Oh every day, I hear "knock knock knock"
Then I see you and you're shaking
And you're breaking and you tell me I'm your only friend
And it starts all over again

[Verse 3]
You said you were living in a buttoned-up world
Living in 1892
There was nothing they could say to convince me
To blame nobody but you

[Verse 4]
We'll tell you some truth and you know it's gonna blow
But you don't give a damn, don't care who's gonna know
You just want everyone talk slow
And give you consent

[Chorus]
Every time I hear "knock knock knock"
I know that it's you
Oh every day, I hear "knock knock knock"
And I see you and you're shaking
Oh you're breaking so I put down my poison pen
And it starts all over again

[Outro]
And it starts all over again
And it starts all over again
[?] starts up to give
It's all over again
