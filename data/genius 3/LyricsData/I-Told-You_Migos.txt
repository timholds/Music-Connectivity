You know we told you, you know we never gonna fall
You know we show 'em, now it's time to show you all

[Verse 1: Quavo]
I told 'em all , so you know I gotta show them (Showed you)
Put the Migo gang on my back, on my shoulders (Migo gang)
I know my niggas gon' attack like vultures
I told 'em that we gonna take the game over
Young nigga from the north side, trying to make a hundred mil at the right time
If you wanna try pull out something that'll open your eyes
Open your mind, open your mind, it's chopper time
I told them we independent, nigga, I don't wanna sign

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Offset]
You know I told you, you know I told you
We blew up like balloons, we blew up like balloons
They thought I was a fool, they thought I was a fool
Young nigga
My money good, my money good
Had to jump over the obstacle, they couldn't believe it, impossible
We number one, nobody stopping us, you and me, total opposite
I ain't going back to zero, I got a bald head just like Ne-Yo
I told you niggas I ain't going broke, a million dollars and a million more

[Hook]
I told you, that the Migos on top
I told you, that we gon' get that guap
