[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
Have you seen her on the dance floor

That’s the lightning and the thunder
You wanna meet her, you wanna touch her
See the light in her eyes, and it starts to make you wonder

[Pre-Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man, bring him to the dance floor
Go on let them jeans touch you while you're dancing

[Verse 3: Iggy Azaela]
They begging me to drop down on it but right now Iggy on the top
The last time the world seen a booty this good, it was on Jenny from the block
I got 'em going crazy lately
But baby knowin' that only make me
Wanna tell all of my ladies to get up on the floor and just shake it, shake it
Ya'll know what I've been on, ya'll know that I've been on
I'm queen big booty, Iggy, now find me a throne to sit on
Girls with the cheeks, put 'em hands in the air
Then pop that, pop that, let 'em know that you there
See, everybody wanna get a taste
You know that we've got enough to share
But fact we girls with the big fat booty too fancy to ever play fair

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez]
Mesmerized by the size of it
You can fight it if you like take your time
I can guarantee you’ll have the time of your life
Throw up your hands if you love a big booty
