(Krazy)
From the moment that i saw you that night
Only thing that kept me going was your vibe
One of those shows that didn't seem to go right
Pointed you out told you to meet me at stage side

(Bridge)
I would have payed to just come and see you
The way that you dance love the way that you move
Got one of me need a poster of you
Your the girl that puts the picture in my mind

(Chorus)
Guess you dont understand i'll be you biggest fan
When i get off the stage tonight i wanna be your man
Now thankyou for wantin me but i need you in my life
If this night goes the way that i planned i'll be your biggest fan

(Verse 2)
At the signing you was nowhere to be seen
An now i wanna see you more that you came to see me
Im gettin nervous will i find the words to say
Now ain't it funny it should be the other way

(Bridge)
I would have payed to just come and see you
The way that you dance love the way that you move
Got one of me need a poster of you
Your the girl that puts the picture in my mind

(Chorus)
(Rocky B)
Front row the rock spots a chic that dont want his dough
But still loves his hits that the way to go if i was poor or rich she wouldn't let me go
Cuz this
(krazy) chick is so damn getto oh (rocky b)she wants to chill and roll wiv me
(krazy) backstage
(rocky b) and when it comes to blazin she can blaze all day
(krazy) she wants him for the many years not the status that comes along with bein famous

(Flava)
Hold up yo lemmie break this down
With only 8 bars its so hard to take the crown
I bin watchin your style girl its bin a while since i seen ya at the show can't wait to meet ya
And treat ya good do everything i should need ya flava so bad got me touching wood
We could blaze it rearrange it turn the pages and if we meet again i'll forget about the wages

(repeat chorus x 2 till fade)
