Please please stop

If you see her
Please give her this message
Oh won't you tell her
How much I miss her
Even Better
Tell her I must meet her
Or tell her that I love her
And nothings changed

You see together
We were stronger
Alas no longer
Are we together

And God forbid
If I should never ever see her
And God forbid
If I was to blame
I remember
Not so long ago
When I was hers and she was mine

Togehter
We were stronger
Alas no longer
Are we together

You see together
We were stronger
Alas no longer
Are we together

So if you see her
Please please give her this message

Oh how I love her
Oh how I love her
Oh yes I love her
Oh how I love her

You see together
We were stronger
Alas no longer
Are we together

You see together
We were so strong
Alas no longer
Are we together
