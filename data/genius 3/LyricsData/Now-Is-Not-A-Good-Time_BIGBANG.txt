I remember you and my
Father telling stories
From a time that still
Shines our way
Now if someone from the
Future or the past
Should call asking
How we're feeling today
I realize I've got stories
But they don't feel like my own
The light is too cold and this
Car's not even mine

I'm gonna have to call you back
'cause
Now is not a good time
I'm gonna have to call you back
'cause
Now is not a good time

Covered up in
Dark blue now the wind
Blows us away from our families
The smoke and the rust
And we're beyond politics
We don't ask hoping god will
Bless us for that

But 50 years ago my grandmother
Saved an Englishman
And a Canadian
From winter mountains and war

I'm gonna have to call you back
'cause
Now is not a good time
I'm gonna have to let you go now
And now's not a good time

Medicine in motion
Get your I-shuffles on
We're almost dancing
And somewhat informed
Something great might just happen
'cause
Now is not a good time
And you don't wanna know
Now's not a good time
