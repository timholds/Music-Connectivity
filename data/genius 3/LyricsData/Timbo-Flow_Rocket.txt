[Verse 1: Scorcher]
Man don't rep the ends, I'm too old for that
Or chase gyal, I'm too cold for that
I do motorways, not motormouth
I've got gyal in north and over south
Hold it up, my gang hold it down
Dem bwoy dere some new guys
They should act and fuck off rap
Cuh dem bwoy, they sell true lies
I don't wanna hear all that, fuck all of them
There's plenty gyal, I want all of them
Beat it once and I'll call again
And then call again and we're cool again
I'll buss it up like I buss mic
Love life, fuck a love life
This ain't love, man fucked twice
She's still down, that's the upside

[Verse 2: Rocket]
Man can't wait to
Get out the ends and that
Man can't wait to break off bread
With all of the friends and that
All about loaf but I ain't a loafer
Can't put it on me, I ain't a coaster
Fuck what they told ya
I keep the friends, not enemies closer
Man don't care 'bout nuttin' but the fam
Wait, you can't even try fake man
Slap away fake palms, don't shake hands, yeah
Captain Morgan, Guinness in hand
Take two sips from the can
Plots and scheming, PAP-ing
Getting in pounds and grands in
