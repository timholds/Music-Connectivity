It's a fight to the end
And death to the brave
I will defend
What's left to be saved

You fade away
You take the bait
You won't survive
There's no escape

You're caught in the flame
(It's always the same thing)
No-one to blame
(You'll just have to hate me)
And nothing will change
(It's always the same thing)
A moth to the flame
(And no-one is listening)

There's nowhere to hide
You can't erase
The blood on your hands
The guilt on your face

You fade away
You take the bait
You won't survive
There's no escape

You're caught in the flame
(It's always the same thing)
No-one to blame
(You'll just have to hate me)
And nothing will change
(It's always the same thing)
A moth to the flame
(And no-one is listening)

You're caught in the flame
And everything's fading

Drawn to the light
The Siren is too much to resist
She takes the life and the breath
From all that exists
You refuse to ever learn
So you will burn

You're caught in the flame
(It's always the same thing)
No-one to blame
(You'll just have to hate me)
And nothing will change
(It's always the same thing)
(Always the same thing)

A moth to the flame

A moth to the flame

And no-one is listening
