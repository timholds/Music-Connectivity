Same kid, always stayed low key/
Roll through the Valley bumpin H.O.C., off the tape O.D./
Plenty dudes who used to hate on me/
Would send requests, tryna get in games of Halo 3/
But its chilll tho, im still so so, bout my ill, flowing/
Still they try this beef shit like buffalo bill's colon/
You'll be Wilco-in, always playing Uncle/
My names mumbled, afraid that I may trouble, your pace/
With my rebuttal.. I go off like a space shuttle/
You play the puddle, get stepped on when I break huddle/
Your whole team's on my circumsized tip, but/
There's no squares in my circle, you can't circumscribe shit/
So quit asking me, yo you spit? fantastically/
And unmixed, so master me, cuz my shit is dastardly, hitting/
Writtens like Cassidy, then they lie like "That was free,"/
Riiight, no wonder nobodys fucking with you like chastity/
Your majesty, can get his ass whipped when I grab a sheet/
Have a half a tree, divied up and passed to me, in a sweet/
There's no relation to Mac. your #1's cousin, like a deck of cards/
Jack shows up, your 1 doesnt/

Im buzzing, bumpin Domo Genesis/
Feeling fly as pegasus, my drive is sly as lexuses/
My game is big as texas is, the ass behind alexis is/
And im just tryna set my shit above of all of these pessimists/
The message is.. that this is the kid's year/
And if your to spit here, your destined to get smeared/
Like queers, in the game, my names feared like Vick's here/
Cuz after I switch gears, to six, ears are kicked, clear im shit-face/
Fresh off of an average-ass mixtape, but ready to dic-tate/
My place, feeling heavy as dick-weight, the stakes are/
They tryna tell me where the brakes are/
No car, my bars respond only to eight balls, I'm on one/

But I'm fresh off two, in my diamond crew/
Sea green tea, or off-blue/
I cross dudes, leave em living off soft fooods/
Their jaws too sore, from awe droped, they achoooed/
Yea, Hint of the sickness, I'm hindering hitlists/
Of visc-ious vigilantes fishing for biscuits/
I switch em like stick shifts, and hit em like thick hips/
They rolling, I kick flip em, hold em and nitpick em/
Sick wit em, no,im sick of em, more/
Curriculum is coming, but keep humming, your summoned/
Under my freshness, out for the best, my obsession/
The rest can wake me when the test is...done/
