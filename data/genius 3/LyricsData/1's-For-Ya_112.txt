Q, Mike, Slim, Daron

[Verse 1]
You say, you say
You say, you say, you say–
You bout to have a long day
Well if you’re headed for the door
Girl that’s the wrong way
You should be looking for your charger
Where your phone, babe?
Go ‘head call your boss
To take some time off
I’m breaking you off
I know you’re grown, babe
But you still look good in your thong, baby
All them Pilates got your body looking toned, babe
And I dare say you should work from home, babe
That’s all baby

[Pre Chorus]
I just went to that bank
Just to get a thousand singles I can blow all over your cake
Girl you mind, I don’t mind if I gotta pay
You’re the one so I had to go run and get some

[Chorus]
1’s for ya, 1’s for ya
Just to show you I’m the
One for you, one for you
I’m just trying to have some
Fun wit‘chu, fun wit‘chu
Girl it’s fun making love
To the one you love
Come get this money; I’m the
One for you one for you
And you know I got them
1’s for ya, 1’s for ya
I’m just trying to have some
Fun wit‘chu, fun wit‘chu
Ain’t it fun making love
To the one you love
Come get this money

[Verse 2]
I said don’t get it twisted
I’m making deposits
So you know I got it
They can’t call it trickin’
No way, no way, no way
I love the way you sit it
Dip it, flip it, lick it
And you gon’ get 50 Benji’s
She said ok, ok, ok
Imagine when I tell her; the bank teller
I need a thousand 1’s I can tell that she was jealous
When my baby turns into a stripper
I’ma have to turn this livin’ room into a strip club

[Pre Chorus]
I just went to that bank
Just to get a thousand singles I can blow all over your cake
Girl you mind, I don’t mind mind if I gotta pay
You’re the one so I had to go run and get some

[Chorus]
1’s for ya, 1’s for ya
Just to show you I’m the
One for you, one for you
I’m just trying to have some
Fun wit‘chu, fun wit‘chu
Girl it’s fun making love
To the one you love
Come get this money; I’m the
One for you one for you
And you know I got them
1’s for ya, 1’s for ya
I’m just trying to have some
Fun wit‘chu, fun wit‘chu
Ain’t it fun making love
To the one you love
So I had to make a run and get some
1’s for ya, 1’s for ya
Just to show you I’m the
One for you, one for you
I’m just trying to have some
Fun wit‘chu, fun wit‘chu
Girl it’s fun making love
To the one you love
Come get this money; I’m the
One for you one for you
1’s for ya, 1’s for ya
Fun wit‘chu, fun wit‘chu
(I ain’t trippin’ I’m just having fun)
Ain’t it fun making love
(Spending 1’s you’re the only one)
To the one you love
Come get this money, hey
