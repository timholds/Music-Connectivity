[Verse 1]
I was leaning on the bar with a glass half empty
Washing down the dust when she brushed up against me
She was soft, she was pretty everything that I'm not
She said you look lonesome
I said yeah I get that a lot

[Chorus]
And she knew I was a cowboy
I was born headed west
She knew I was a cowboy
When we met

[Verse 2]
I had mud on my boots and my hat stained with sweat
Lines on my face and miles of regret
But my silver belt buckle, it still caught her eye
The only thing I've got that still got its shine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Had a mind made up, both hands on the wheel
Her bags in the back of that old Oldsmobile
Left her tears on the pocket of my pearl button shirt
I whispered I loved her
But I don't think she heard

[Outro]
But she knew I was a cowboy
Not what she needed I guess?
But she knew I was a cowboy
When we met
Yeah she knew I was a cowboy
When she left
