[Verse 1]
Left Laredo with the sun in my eyes
Broken heart and a bloodshot sky
Been running since she left me alone
Way up north in San Antone
Days get long but I don't get far
Spent last night in some low life bar
Found her memory in some Mezcal haze
Lost my mind while the guitar played

[Chorus]
I'm going to carry this burden way out west
Find a way to lay this hurt to rest
Live it up until I live her down
Lost in tequila town

[Verse 2]
Left her standing in a tear-stained dress
I cursed the day that I confessed
Wayward sins of a mortal man
Watched the ring come off her hand
Looking back on all I've lost
Price I've paid ain't worth the cost
I'll run this road until it ends
And maybe find my way back to her again

[Chorus][x2]
