[Intro Talking : Wiley]
She ain't calling me again though (haha)
Pinged us as well though
And them peng ones (jezus)

[Verse 1: Wiley]
We were close, felt special
She was telling me she was ready to settle
I said I feel the same way too
Went to meet her the same day too
It's not easy finding the right one
Then messing it up like i've done
That's wasting time, I can't take it
Come on make a promise, then shortly break it
She began to feel quite sad
I began to feel quite mad
Cause it burns me to know I might not change
Got too many women on the brain, I'm going insane
Got to slow down, let her fly cause I don't wanna slow her down
If I do it any more i'll be feeling the pain
It's not what I want so i've gotta go away
And away i'll stay
Nobody likes being alone
I might be up all night on the phone
And this girl's telling me how she wanna come and sit right down in my zone
The one that I found is cold
Icy blue eyes rest in face
We got not no ties so we can have fun every night, let's ride
She wants Nando's, I want Chinese
I'm a capricorn, She was a pisces
We used to go river-side sightseeing
We had a well nice drink with black cheese
Let the night breathe, I feel lively
She wants to be with Kylie
We like to spend time on a friday
Any time you want to see my babe, dial me

Drank too much wine, in a short space of time I'm lagging
Some people don't want us to have a good time babe, but that's what we're having
Whether they like it or not we are bonding
Whether they excited or not we might be meant for each other, whether we fight it or not
Lately i've been a bit all on my A game
In the studio I don't play games, ask her
See her two times in eight days then I might not see her for another eight days
Cause I wanna find these vibes that I find when I'm looking
She knows i'll share the cake that I'm cooking
It's all me and her, nobody else gonna get a look in

My pattern is ready for new ways
I was on one song, steady for two days
I get countless vibes through the haze
Check the radio's when I get plays
And I get praise, all well deserved
And this energy was too well preserved
And I told my mum i'd do well for her
I feel life dragged her through life, she's hurt
Stay alert in the world, it's a must
No trust and we gotta blame us
When it's all done and dusted it's dust
And we can't live on the crust of a crust
We decided not too, Cause of hard work this is where we got too
If you really wanna win nobody can stop you
What you can achieve might even shock you
All runaway stuff like samples
Set examples, I'm building castles
While I got a brother on role passing parcels
Close fam' I love, I've got a heartful
No doubt, I'm gonna break the cycle
Smile on the face for heatwave, delightful
Catch them easy hooks, they're reciteful
Bv-care the team we're vital
We're vital (x2)
Bv-care the team we're vital
