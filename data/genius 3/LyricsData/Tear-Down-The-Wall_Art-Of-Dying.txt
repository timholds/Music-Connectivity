[Verse 1]
Who do I turn to? And what do I do?
I'm looking for answers, the lies and the truth
I thought I knew better, but I don't know shit
It's gotta be out there, something better than this

[Chorus x2]
I'm caught in the middle of life
Somewhere in the middle of love
Nothing's gonna change till I break these chains
And I tear down the wall

[Verse 2]
What is the meaning and where does it end?
What does it matter until it begins?
I can't go backwards, I can't give in
Feels like the future is dying and the past is dead

[Chorus x2]
I'm caught in the middle of life
Somewhere in the middle of love
Nothing's gonna change till I break these chains
And I tear down the wall

[Bridge]
Brick by brick
Brick by brick
Brick by brick
Brick by brick
Tear it down with me
Tear it down with me now!
Go!

[Chorus x2]
I'm caught in the middle of life
Somewhere in the middle of love
Nothing's gonna change till I break these chains
And I tear down the wall
