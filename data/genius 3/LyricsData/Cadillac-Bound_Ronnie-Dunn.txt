[Verse 1]
Baby you look like a million bucks
That beat up Chevy with the dash tore up
And the window down
We’re Cadillac bound
Yeah, we've got dreams we can almost touch
Like a world where money don’t mean too much
And the checks don’t bounce
We’re Cadillac bound
Yeah better things ain't built over night
It’s a good thing I love a good fight

[Chorus]
We ain't got too much
What little we've got’s enough
One day it will all add up with a little bit of God and love
Going to work till it turns around
May not look like it now
We’re moving up, moving out
Yeah you and me baby, we’re Cadillac bound

[Verse 2]
Your daddy don’t think we’re going to make it
I’m just another rule you’re breaking
We’re going to prove your daddy wrong
Make your momma proud
We’re Cadillac bound
Better hold on and hold tight
Can almost see the promise land tonight

[Chorus][x2]
