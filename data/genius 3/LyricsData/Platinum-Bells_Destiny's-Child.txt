Ladies, remember long ago, long ago
We asked Santa to get us Christmas dolls, get us Christmas dolls
But now this year, the dolls are you and me, the dolls are you and me
Got the chi'ren under the Christmas tree, the Christmas tree
We've come so far, and it feels so, yes it feels so good
And we're sharin' all our Christmas love, all our Christmas love
We invite you, you to celebrate, to celebrate
On this very, very, very, very special Christmas day

Platinum bells (platinum bells)
Platinum bells (platinum bells)
It's Christmas time with the chi'ren
Ring-a-ling-a-ling (ring-a-ling-a-ling)
Hear DC sing (hear DC sing)
Soon it will be Christmas day

Ring-a-ling-a-ling (Ring-a-ling-a-ling)
Ring-a-ling-a-ling (Ring-a-ling-a-ling)
Ring-a-ling-a-ling (Ring-a-ling-a-ling)
Ring-a-ling-a-ling'

Merry Christmas from Destiny's Child!
