[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
No time to waste, don't rush the pace
Live life top shelf, no time to chase
No time to wait for those that ain't runnin'
Window tint on the whip 'cause every day it ain't sunny
Hoes cop feelings 'cause you lookin' like fresh
Car talk back and your pockets like Shrek
You might blow it all when you cash your check
You only live once, why not look your best?
Throwin' money like look at that mess
Talkin' shit at the table, double your bet
Fuck a broad that you swear you just met
While chillin' in the VIP talkin' shit to a rep
Promise her a trip overseas when you're flyin' out
Same club owner, yeah you think you might buy 'em out
'Cause it's mind over matter
Climbin' up the ladder, 'til you're hangin' from the scaffold
It's either that player or you're just cattle
If you ain't 'bout money, nigga what you after?

[Hook: Big KRIT]
Is you the dope boy of your life or you just gettin' high?
Get it in all the time or you're gettin' by?
Push the pedal overdrive or you never ride?
If they rush and you clutch, would you let them fly?
It's either eat or you're starvin'
If you ain't talkin' money beg your pardon
It's either eat or you're starvin'
If you ain't got it, shawty, how could you argue?

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
And you wonder why a jacker run up on you
Demeanor is a goon but that ain't your persona
Got you on the corner, at that very moment you could die
For those jewels if you really, really want 'em
So come up off on 'em, don't get caught up in the hype
Play it lowkey, mothafucka flashin' lights
What means the world to you?
You wanted much more but the world'll do
To no more friends, some things have changed
Never in the hood 'cause it ain't the same
Money breathe envy and the streets ain't friendly
When they're askin' for help but you really can't lend it
Turn that hate before you finish your sentence
Tried to put 'em on but they ain't see your vision
Just to be in your postition 'cause ain't shit given
Type of livin cost blood, sweat and tears
Seemed overnight but it took a few years
Overcoming your fears
To be the one they toast to when they holla "Cheers"
You don't wanna play 'em to the left
But you gotta look out for yourself

[Hook]
