"Hangin' With MTV" Host (Julia Sweeny):
We have an exclusive MTV world premiere. Yeah, a hot new group from
Atlanta that we're hearing big things from: G-Spot!

(Cut to a quintet of black men in orange ghetto attire. The only two
Familiar faces are those of Rock and Meadows.)

Tim (singing):
Hey girl - take off your dress right now
I'm lookin' at your body, and I wanna say ...

Chris:
Oww

Tim (singing):
You go through the shinin', got extensions in your hair
You say the kid's in the other room, but you know that I don't care

Chris (singing):
Babay, ... buzz me at the do'
Pull up your skirt, child, now pull it up some mo'
Your panties are green, and your bra is pink
Now suck on my tic-tac, so your breath won't stiiiink

Chorus (2x): G-Spot (singing)
All I wanna do, is suck your big toe
Suck it reeeeal slow, I wanna suck your big fat toe

Chris (singing):
Honay, your toe tastes so sweet
You got a big corn on it - ooh! I love the extra meat!

Tim (singing):
Your mind says no, but your body says yes
I'm lookin' at the backside, baby, and thinkin'
"Damn, this bitch is blessed!"

Chorus

Chris (singing):
This little piggy wants tastin'
And this little piggy wants sex
This little piggy wants raisin'
But your big toe is the best!

Chris (talking):
Yeah, girl - that's the reason I love ya, baby!
I love every lil' thing about ya
Baby! I love that nose ring you got in your nose, baby
And I love your big fat toe
I love the way you tell the cops you ain't seen me in two years, baby!
Yeah, girl, just come here, baby, let me suck on your toe! Don't run!
I would never hit a woman - unless she owes me money! Come on!!

Chorus

Chris: Yeah baby, gimme some toe!
