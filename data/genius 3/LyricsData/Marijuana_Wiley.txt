[Hook: Richie Spice]

Burning marijuana pon di corner
It keep me calmer, it make me smarter
Burning on di highway, it's the highest grade
Getting to my head

Burning marijuana pon di corner
It keep me calmer, it make me smarter
Burning on di highway, it's the highest grade
Getting to my head

[Verse 1: Wiley aka. Eskiboy]

I stay calm and blaze the high grade
You can smell my ting in every dance I play dem
Smell my ting in every club I spray dem
Grime scene's locked it's mine for the taking

It don't slow me down I stay level and
I ain't time wasting on the road money is making
Over grams waiting while I'm [Sample from hook]

Can't leave London it's hard man
I swing around this jungle like Tarzan
If you don't believe me just ask
Kylie stays warm like tea in a flask man

No dibby sound boy won't pass
For since 99 year my name's lasted
I got heart no I ain't half-hearted

[Hook]

(Verse 2: Frisco)

I blaze marijuana on the corner
Bun an informer
When I blaze weed I will heat up your frame like sauna
Send on the ting cause don't be a staller
I bun weed when I'm stressed out
Come to my yard my yards all sessed out
Come check me and Eski we got the best of the best
And I'm herbally blessed and I'm [sample from hook]

I'm a ziggies then biggie big big
Don't need a strap to see you're weak
Take couple draws of a spliff and you'll be like
"I don't think I've used enough cig"
When I'm billing zoots separate seed and twig
I'm a ganja man
Blaze weed like ganja fam
That's the plan man I ganja farmer

[Verse 3: Wiley aka. Eskiboy]

Eskiboy back with a banger
I got the keys to the blocks of your manor
I roll deep can't see me in the manor
You can't come to war with a pissed off spanner
Man roll like the [?] with Jammer
Cruise bad still but my cruise badder
I ain't scratch a D but I'm sharp like a dagger

And it didn't work when I had a yearly planner
Go to XL yeah you can ask Hannah
I was on my ass six [?] for your manor
Roll with Mario and Mega Montana
Don't get hype yeah I'm not a gun clapper
Going in like it was a lyrical dapper
You could never teach me nothing about Ragga
