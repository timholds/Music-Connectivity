Siren with a song in your eye
Slashing through my ear like a beast
Seven times I leapt upon your shore
Every night I let you conquer me
You're my Queen, You're my Queen
You're my Queen, You're my Queen
Serpent with your blue planet eyes
Passing like a ship through my sleep
Seven times I kissed you on the mouth
Every night I let You conquer me
You're my Queen, You're my Queen
You're my Queen, You're my Queen
