I'm awake too late when I don't wanna be/
Still have a hard time finding honesty/
It's honestly hard to write a song for me/
Without 'em learning info on somethin' which I dont wanna speak/
But its hard to be dope, without a note or two/
About the hoes, money, or clothes, thats found quotable/
Minnesota, with cold shoulders on overdose/
Snow that blows, try to take it in, your prone to frozen noses/
Mitosis, mind synched with psychosis/
My fault tho, never made the wise choices/
Dried voice, my boys, told me slow down/
Wish I woulda known how, when they said to throw down/
The gloves, love and drugs, its all shrubbery/
Artificial bliss, corrupts that in front of me/
No company 'round to see me struggling/
Uttering curses under his breathe, death, another thing/
I don't dread about, mind told me let it out/
'Stead a metaphorically pennin' lyrics, I read it out loud/
With a tall shout, growing balls now, small crowd/
Still my pen to the pad, it falls out/

(Hook)

First line I wrote down, was all out/
From there I knew i'd let it falll out/
Some things to good, to not talk 'bout/
And some schemes to mean to not chalk out, so I/
Let it fall out, in the face of doubt, or faceless shouts, it fallls out/
Balls out, for you, its all doubt, all they every talk bout is whether or not he'll fall out, so I let it falll out/

I've got a past with things I never talk about/
Things I maybe should have told my doc aboutt/
Cottonmouth king, things I rrhmyed about/
Were way too hard to swallow for me, I had to cough em out/
Probably why they say I'm deep, to a level/
Heat to a kettle, see mystique in the devil/
Hit my peak, I was weak, when I speak, still I tremble/
Pedals creek, on the steep, set of streets, where I mellowed/
Hello Hell, our gelled cells are felt seldom/
But when I feel it, His healing is really less helping/
Stress melts the pelt thats all around him/
My eyes closed so tell me whats the outcome/
Is God out for me, or alchemy?/
The reason that im leaving, were about to seee/
No doubt from me, I back out the bout indeed/
So Lord tell me whats the route for me, ya see../

First line I wrote down, was all out/
From there I knew i'd let it falll out/
Some things to good, to not talk 'bout/
And some schemes to mean to not chalk out, so I/
Let it fall out, in the face of doubt, or faceless shouts, it falls out/
Balls out, for you, its all doubt, all they every talk bout is whether or not he'll fall out, so I let it falll out/
Let it fall out, in the face of doubt, or faceless shouts, it fallls out/
Balls out, for you, its all doubt, all they every talk bout is whether or not he'll fall out, so I let it falll out/

Believe in the ressurection of people/
Presence of ghosts, and uncorrectional evil/
Equal are the good-doers, still they only focus/
Negatively on the torture that he could do us/
Could prove us, like he did with Pearl Harbor/
Hiroshima, Nagasaki, Nazi Regime/
Hate for Islamics, or fighter pilots goin at/
Kamikaze, The Stazi, and al-Qaddafi/
God knows, I'm way too heated to stop me, so watch/
Facebook, there's just too much to share wit ya/
Can't Tweet it in 140 characters/
Its terrible, tryna fit a facade/
Unbearably Hard, dropping this art, I trust God/
He must not respond, from busstops with rhymes/
To plush-pocket lines, it's time, I tell Ozzy/
Let the beat drop, and fall, and I'll copy
All my Walls drop, like bars over the Floppy/
