Jennylyn:
If I'm not in love with you
What is this I'm going through, tonight
And if my heart is lying
What should I believe in
Why do I go crazy
Every time I think about you baby
Why else do I want you like I do
If I'm not in love with you, with you

Janno Gibbs:
And if I don't need your touch
Why do I miss you so much, tonight
If it's just infatuation
Why is my heart aching
To hold you forever (to hold you forever)
Give a part of me I thought I'd never (I thought I'd never)
Give again to someone I could lose
If I'm not in love with you (If I'm not in love with you)

Oh why in every fantasy
Do I feel your arms embracing me
Like lovers lost in sweet desire
(Someone tell me why)
And why in dreams do I surrender
Like a little baby (Like a little baby)
How do i explain this feeling
Someone tell me (Someone tell me)

If I'm not in love with you
What is this I'm going through, tonight
And if this heart is lying then (if this heart is lying...)
What I should believe in (oooh...)
Why do I go crazy ( why do i go crazy)
Every time I think about you baby (think about you baby)
Why else do I want you like I, I do (want you like I do, ooh...)
If I'm not in love
If I'm not in love
If I'm not in love with
If I'm not in love with... you
