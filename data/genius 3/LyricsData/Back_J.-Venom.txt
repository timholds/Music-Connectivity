[Intro]

[Verse 1: J. Venom]
Venom on the mic man, poison, I got em frozen
Like deer in headlights man, they ain't even fuckin' know it
That it's over, man I'm flowin' the coldest
Ice age shit man, cavemen breakin' the molds and
Doper than an IV filled with dilaudid
Odd man out, man fuck it I'm never stoppin
Got a problem? come see me
J an Sumi'll get ya straightened out for free

[Verse 2: Sumi]
Everybody, the beats, these treats
And I am slave to the waves of all you see
Light, water, sound all around even the trees
When they sway please me, the leaves dance and the trance is like a treaty
Suffering surrounds but I'm drowning in ease pulled pits and sweets
Delicious n' nutritious paleo parakeets
They tweet when they judge up I'mma eat
Seem sweet when their blood floods through my teeth

[Verse 3: J. Venom]
Back with the fuckin vengeance, i'll say it again bitch
We back with the fucking vengeance and killing again bitch
The fucks up ya'll? we ain't talkin small
Me an Sumi killin tracks like it was nature's call
Call me mixed up, but I'm like Hirano,
Alone in a crazy world that's filled with problems
Spit flow colder than AC Freon
Screamin out fuck the Feddies man, Hail Zeon

[Verse 4: Sumi]
I know... Watchin offa' Tillamook, zombies shufflin' around
See em sittin' from my porch and I dunno the hell is on
But blood is puddlin' in the street and sweet it's got a rosey creep
The gubbies tryin' to keep it sweep
It's like we're being covered up, Suppression
It's like the world ain't blowin' up, Compression
It's like we're being swept under the rug, Confession
Held from the public, Sumi and J. Venom again, I'm guessing
