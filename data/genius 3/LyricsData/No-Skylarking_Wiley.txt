[Verse 1]
Block party, everybody vibsing
See me in the corner billin' up my ting
Ain't seen Donny in a while, it's a life ting
But it's still bless cause he knows where the vibe is
Lemon and Grey, Sprite and Ciroc
Chillin' on the street with a gyal that we got
Cuh really it's this why I picked up a mic though
With the MCs that I know
A4 paper, biro
My pen was hotter than Cairo
Yeah I was a lyrical psycho
Sparying up a set like a full can of lysol
Listeners, show me a sign though
I was in Dagenham picking up rhino
I can't get it any more, that's a sign of the times though
I ain't falling behind though
I'm fully aware everywhere that I go

[Hook]
I set the pace, no skylarking
Step aside when big man are talking
Mind out where the dogs them are barking
Stand back when the cars 'em are parking
This ain't a normal shubs it's our ting
All the way to the bank we're laughing
Money gets made we half it, pass it
You know me well, I will never stop grafting

[Verse 2]
I'm a local, hit me at the local
Once in a blue though I gotta stay hopeful
Tell 'em all I'm at the other end of a phone call
But it ain't new, us man are old school
It's been a while
"How you been Wile? What do you use?"
Logic or Pro Tools
Some man go to work with no tools
No work I don't mess with those fools
I'm on a path, you gotta go hard
I'm first round there so you gotta go last
I'm heavy like Big Narst
I got big bars that I gotta flick past
If I don't kill it on the riddim that's strange
Cause when I'm on the stage all I do is get praise
That's great, got fans that rep me
I like the way they accept me

[Hook]

[Bridge]
MC MC, man a MC
I rinse off my ting till the clip is empty
Music ting, I'm a street envy
I got so many connects to connect the P's
MC MC, man a MC
I rinse off my ting till the clip is empty
Music ting, I'm a street envy
I got so many connects to connect the P's like jeez
Some get along, some don't
Some work together but I get some won't
Life's way too short for the bullshit
Last 5 let me collect the dough
Get that, get that
I don't wanna see another setback
If I do I gotta take a step back
I shouldn't limit myself but if I didn't then I would have to give it myself

[Hook] (x2)
