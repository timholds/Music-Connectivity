[Ghetts]
I ain’t got tats on my skin
But I got scars from the scraps I've been in
At least a glass in my hand when I swing
Wanna take me apart & dismantle my limbs
Your drunk you can’t handle your drink
A lot of men put their lives on the line
Only God knows what these gamblers think
Sometimes I’m surprised I’m alive
My lucks bad I’m a jinx
I don’t wanna risk my life its worth more
At least I never had to fight a turf war
Living in a place where crime occurs more
Man are like yo I just buss mine
So its only right you burst yours
I’m a leader not a follower
I’m a need at least a reason to body ya
In defense or its me with the coroner
Jesus Christ
I’m tryna walk on a righteous path
Anybody that knows me well would tell you I don’t wanna write violent bars
And anybody that knows me well would tell you 'my mans got a diamond heart'
Plus I’m getting older and wiser darg
I analyse my life to find myself
Body, spirit, soul, mind apart
But expect that
Some of the old fans won’t respect that
But I'm a grown man (grown man una)
And I'll be damned if my music now don’t reflect that
I ain't one of these new wave dons
I don’t wanna be the hardest out
Nowadays I’m influenced by lupe’ songs
Substance in abundance
And if you wondered what I’m gonna come with next
Probably won’t appeal to some younger’s
See I know what they wanna hear
They wanna hear me say to an MC
Suck ya mum and she’s got Gonorrhea!
But I'm way too deep for that
I’m one of these people that don’t believe the crap the media been feeding man
I got a feeling fam
So I'm digging in deeper than
A rassclart preacher can
Most of the worlds plugged into the Matrix
How do you know
I took the red pill
Now I’m accustomed to the basics
Screaming knowledge is power
Open the book knowledge is ours
Now I can have an argument in Parliament with them when its politics hour
They say run man a David Blaine them man are on a next frequency
But if you ain't got an open mind
You can watch and not even see
My mother used to tell me frequently
Young blood know where you come from
Yes the subjects deep indeed
I know where I come from know where I’m heading
Outsiders get air when they’re breadin
I don’t need your approval
I don’t care is what I tell em
I’m just being truthful
This here’s in my denims
Before you could search google
I had a career so F’ em
Until its my funeral
Ima be right here selling
I ain't the usual
Are you aware I’m a peasant

But I got ambition nigga
So I see the bigger picture
And I can’t see competion
Unless its in the mirror
Ambition nigga
So I see the bigger picture
And I can’t see competion
Unless its in the mirror

[Mercston]
Let me tell you what my reportoire is
Life and the drama
I thank God that I got a strong partner
One day its like I’m living in a beach house
Next day its like I’m living in the Gaza
State of mind gotta take my time with it though
Tell myself there ain't much time till I blow
When I blow you won't see me all icy ya know
Wrist already pricey ill tell you what I see you know
Living in a country when IC3 ain't as important as IC1
They wan like only blacks have 3 8′s
And the white man can never have one
What happened to equality
The Governments fucking up the economy I never talk Politics
Usually swerve the controversy
I wan talk real life Monopoly
Imagine if Jack was Jill
And Humpty was Dorothy what i’m just saying we don’t know whats real
We’re all programmed still
Let me leave that
Jump in the Merc and lean back
Pump some wale on a deep track
Thats why they’re gonna love me for my ambition
No matter the position
Tatt’s all on my arms if i’m getting married I ain't getting a prenup
Kilo grams I kill it with Cheese Skunk
Phone anybody else for the cheese
My girls got an Ora no Rita
These other girls never level on a meter
But I might beat her
Really I need to see a preacher or pastor
Forgive me father
For committing adultery
I just wanted to ball like parker
Hurting those that are close to me
Mum don’t approve of the work trade
Early hours of the morning in the work place
Just me, Tanita and a suitcase
Bags of reefa let the room haze
Tell my woman ill be back in a few days
I never hear you moan when im buying shit
I don’t wanna hear you moan when im grinding
Wanna know why im always smiling
Cos I got a hollywood smile prick
Can't miss me in any picture i’m in
I don’t wanna hear a pussyhole hyping
If he ain't straight outline him
More time im on a vibes ting
Ghetts pulled me up about light-skin
Said Merc’s brudda watch what your writing
Take a watch of this DVD
I heard say you never wanna listen this
You affe take in these frequencies
Don’t be lost in the Belly of the Beast
Knowledge is food feast
I got ambition
I got ambition
See what car im whipping
Ambition
I got ambition
See what car im whipping
Fuck all of these women
I got ambition
