[Verse 1]
She got them eyes
That remind me of skies
With the stars in the dark
In the middle of the summer
She got a smile
Like the sun when it rise
Sad man probably lost her
Because she's a winner
She like the same shit I like
Cause she seem like my type
Man I think so
But I never met her
But she stay in my mind
Like a book in its bind
What I mean is
I probably won't forget her
And I kinda wanna meet her
I feel like I could treat her
In ways that she never really been
I'm not tryna move fast
Not tryna be your next or your last
I just wanna be your friend
We could start it off with that
Maybe build our own path
If it don't last we can keep it movin'
We in a different place
But they say good things come if you wait
And I can prove it

[Verse 2]
The doors are open for somebody like you
And I've been hopin' one day I too
Open up
And show you who I really am
One plus one equals two
Which is greater than a million
I know my math sucks
I know I rap but
It's kinda how I reach people when I can't, uh
Find the words I really wanna say
I love music
But maybe you can make me feel the same way
Like to clown a bit
I fuck around with shit
I'm kinda down for this I really like the sound of it
Us
I really hate to see you frown and shit
But its the risk that I would take if I found you, miss
Cause you pretty as some mountain mists
I found you and then I found some bliss
But I'm speaking in the future tense
So find me so we can do this shit
