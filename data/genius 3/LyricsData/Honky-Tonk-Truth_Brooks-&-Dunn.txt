I'm the life of the party, baby, since you said good-bye
Just ask old Joe, He knows, I'm here every night
And that good old boy in the mirror looking around for you
It ain't me
And that's the honky tonk truth

That's the honky tonk truth cross my broken heart
I put my right hand here on this beer And swear on this bar
I ain't thinking, I ain't drinking, I ain't crying
I ain't moaning the blues
I wouldn't lie to you
Now that's the honky tonk truth

Don't think I'll come crawling back 'cause I don't miss you
If you walked up and puckered up, girl
I wouldn't bother to kiss you
And that washed up, broken down fool
Hanging out on that stool Well it ain't me
Now that's the honky tonk truth

That's the honky tonk truth cross my broken heart
I put my right hand here on this beer And swear on this bar
I ain't thinking, I ain't drinking, I ain't crying
I ain't moaning the blues
I wouldn't lie to you
Now that's the honky tonk truth
