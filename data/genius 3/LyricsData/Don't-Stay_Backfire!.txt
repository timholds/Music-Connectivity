Don't stay
Don't like where you stand then move
Don't like being here then choose
To leave this place just walk away
Don't like where you are don't stay

Don't stay
Don't stay
Don't stay
Don't stay
Don't stay
Don't stay

Complain about the friends you've got
Don't like them then why not
Just move ahead and don't look back
Away from the problem you attract

Don't stay
Don't stay
Don't stay
