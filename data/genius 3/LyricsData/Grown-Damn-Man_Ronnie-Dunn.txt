[Verse 1]
I’m a grown damn man
Rough around the edges, That’s what I am
Every line on this face
Has had to fight to earn its place
This heart beating in my chest
Can be a little reckless at times, I guess
These tired baby blues
Still light up when they see you


[Chorus][x2]
I've been around enough by now
Got a few things figured out
By the grace of God I go
Down life’s long and winding road
I’m not rich but I get by
I walk through life with my head held high
I've come by things the hard way
Have my good and my bad days
I like my beer good and cold
Whiskey too much at times I’m told
I like my music with a twang
It comes to you about everything

[Verse 2]
I live simple I work hard
I own my truck you own my heart
Baby until they lay me in my grave
I’ll love you until my dying day
I’m a grown damn man
Rough around the edges that’s what I am
Every line on this face
Has had to fight to earn its place
This heart beating in my chest
Can get a little reckless at times, I guess
These tired baby blues
Still light up when they see you
