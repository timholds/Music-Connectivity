[Verse 1]
Wherever you go, you know I’ll be there
If you go far, you know I’ll be there
Oh I’ll go anywhere
So I’ll see you there
You place the name, you know I’ll be there
You name the time, you know I’ll be there
I’ll go anywhere
So I’ll see you there

[Chorus]
I don’t care if you don’t mind
I’ll be there not far behind
I will dare, keep in mind
I’ll be there for you

[Verse 2]
When there’s truth
You know I’ll be there
Amongst the lies
You know I’ll be there
I’ll go anywhere
So I’ll see you there

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
If you should fall
You know I’ll be there
To catch a call
You know I’ll be there
I’ll go anywhere
So I’ll see you there

[Outro Chorus]
I don’t care if you don’t mind
I’ll be there not far behind
I will dare
Keep in mind
I don’t care
I’ll be there for you
I’ll be there for you
