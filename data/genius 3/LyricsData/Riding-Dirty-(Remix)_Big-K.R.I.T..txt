[Intro: Big KRIT]
Who the fuck ya'll niggas think ya'll too shawty. Young Krizzle, king remembered in time bitch. King of the south, what you know about it? Let's go

[Hook]
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
Have y'all thinkin' I'm Barry White
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
Have y'all thinkin' I'm Barry White

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Shit, so what you know bout me? I play the game on key
Break a bitch then wreck a trick for his D-O-E
I never slipped on game so motherfuck your fame
Fifteen minutes can't compare to how I bang
I could trunk the 'Lac, the ville slumped on wheels
Couldn't peek my shine unless you cleaned my tiles
Wax on, wax off, if you a fuck nigga
They claimin', shootin', where I'm ballin', good look nigga
I still hold my nuts and cobra clutch these bucks
You hold a broke bitch down, I tell a bitch get up
If a bitch don't fuck, then a bitch gone suck
You lost sight on the goal cause you talk too much
I ride around clean with my frame on lean
Fishbowl, raise the doors, as I drop my screens
With a pawn, no player, fifteen bangin'
Goin' back to the future in my time machine
Cause I was

[Hook]
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
Have y'all thinkin' I'm Barry White
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
I put the pressure on the lesser when she on the lights
Ridin' dirty, super tight
Have y'all thinkin' I'm Barry White

[Verse 2: TUT]
Study how the game get us switchin' lanes
I remember hittin' stains for a come up
Nigga we the shit cause we comin' from the bottom
Comin' from a city that you probably never heard of
Ay, hey baby what it seem like
I know you feel it baby, tell me what the lean like
A fiend to the green, sip Promethazine
And some tea and I'm a king for the record
Live a dream for the record
Still wanna cheap on gold dates, take the doze off
Take a half of Zan it made a nigga doze off
I'm pimpin' not your average nigga
Or average nigga
I'm astronomical, fuckin' phenomenal
Dope boys only get back
Sellin' chickens like "what kinda sauce you want with that?"
Sellin' meth like it's molly, nigga better test that
Welcome to the south where the best of the best at
Out here
