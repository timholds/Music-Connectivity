Hey yo
Y'know what I feel like doin?
I feel like doin another Darkchild remix
Na na, Darkchild, Jennifer

C'mon and just dance a little
Lemme see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little
C'mon and dance a little
Lemme see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little
C'mon and just dance a little
Lemme see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little

Now if I give you me
This is how it's got to be
First of all, I won't take you cheating on me
Tell me who can I trust
If I can't trust in you
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool

You said that we
Could possibly
Spend eternity
See that's what you told me
That's what you said
But if you want me
You have to be
Fulfilling all my dreams
If you really want me, babe

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby

You said you want my love
And you've got to have it all
But first, there are some things you need to know
If you wanna live
With all I have to give
I need to feel true love or it's got to end, yeah

I don't want you
Trying to get with me
And I end up unhappy
I don't need the hurt
And I don't need the pain
So before I do
Give myself to you
I have to know the truth
If I spend my life with you

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby

C'mon and just dance a little
Lemme see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Baby work it out and just dance a little
C'mon and just dance a little
Lemme see you dance a little
I like it when you dance a little
Darkchild, Jennifer Lopez

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me
And call me baby
