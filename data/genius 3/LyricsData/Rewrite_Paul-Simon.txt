[Chorus 1]
I've been working on a rewrite, that's right
Going to change the ending
Throw away the title
Toss it in the trash
Every minute after midnight
All the time I'm spending
Is just for working on the rewrite
Going to turn it into cash

[Verse 1]
I been working at the Car Wash
I consider it my day job
Because it's really not a pay job
But that's where I am
Everybody says "The old guy
Working at the Car Wash?"
Hasn't got a brain cell left
Since Vietnam

[Chorus 2]
But I say
Help me, help me
Help me, help me
Thank you!
I'd no idea
That you were there

[Verse 2]
When I said help me, help me
Help me, help me
Thank you
For listening to my prayer
I'll eliminate the pages
Where the father has a breakdown
And he has to leave the family
But he really meant no harm
Gonna substitute a car chase
And a race across the rooftops
Where the father saves the children
And he holds them in his arms

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
