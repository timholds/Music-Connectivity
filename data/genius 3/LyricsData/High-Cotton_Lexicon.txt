Come Back/baby make it come back

In high cotton
Picking out profits
Prophets say we shine in the cosmic
In high cotton
Picking out profits
Black is brighter than the dark so just watch it, ahh

I'm Inspired by those I keep around
See me out representing you now
Stepping forward I never kap ya I got the que
Introduce words to improve n alter they view
Do back breaking work so my kids stand strong
You can't touch me cause I'm so hands on
I see the bigger picture you see pieces of the puzzle
Gotta love yo self before somebody else love you

Hook/hook/ ahhh

Writing dreams fighting scenes of destruction
Media teach you steal that's corruption
Christened in earths flames untame is my ambition
But they trying to take part of mines like diamond commission
Seen a parade of beautiful queens who self hate
Anticipate when their image relay
That of vogue but I pose you to embrace ya cloak
Diversified through the feelings I emote untold
Loving red bones we lust blood
Cynical of life's pinnacle so we don’t trust love
Raise my girl so she don’t get flipped like quarters for head
I pray for progress to lessen my stress
Curly heads wit degrees ain't hot headed
Headed for the best but they wanna keep us separate/ hmm

Hook/hook/

Make it come back/babe make it come back/(2)

From the pew spewing hate say you preaching love
Only open up the gates when the offering up
Political divide rich wanna keep control
Maintain hold of ya soul to feel consoled
Celebrating for days I meditated my plans
Once a lil boy I elevated to man
Seeing are evolution some points we u turned
Cause of who hurt divert the pain to new verts
Pass the rock just to keep the ball rolling
My people stand tall so everyday we growing
I notice I'm trying to get breaded like flour
Bloom like flowers and scrape the sky like a tower
They burn trees cause u throwing so much shade
You can earn fees but learn to pace this race
Missing chapters of gods teachings bringing us freedom
Look for truth in lies of the garden of Eden

Hook/hook/(3)
