In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Running from an opp, and I shoot at opp (what)

Hide it in my sock (what) selling that rerock (what, what, what, what, what)

Shootin' like a soldier, like I'm from Magnolia
All these, niggas, always, fold

I'm suckin' on the clit, she suckin' on the dick
Give that hoe a tip, told her "Buy some kicks"
Then I brush my teeth, pop up in a whip
Glocky in the whip, glocky in the whip
And I'm cocky, fuckin' on a thotty
She just wanna plot me, bitch can't stop me
I'm riding in a Mazi, this ain't even my Mazi
Oh, that's not yo' thottie, yo' bitch look like a aunty
Walked in with Ashanti, damn, that look like Shanti
Damn, that look like Carti, I think dat be Young Carti
Heard he spent a hunnid on a fucking watch piece, that's filthy

[Hook]
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Running from an opp, then I shoot at opp
And I'm on the block
And I'm on the block
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Hide in my sock, selling that rerock
What, what, what, what, what
In New York I Milly Rock, hide it in my sock
Use to sell rerock, running from the cops
Shooting at the opps, you know what I'm sayin'?
