[INTRO]

[Verse 1: J. Venom]
Fuck who's kicking it whack
Man we send that shit right back
Man, JV kicking it crack, fact
We constantly killing tracks
You already know what it is
And you know how we do it
This shit is the movement
I'm talkin' movin' fluid
Fuck settlin' shit man
It's time to battle monsters
Now belligerent bitch
Pocket Monsters like mobsters
Stackin' pokedollars
Shit that's the motive
I'm on my master ball shit
My pockets getting bloated

[Hook: J. Venom]
Kickin' back stackin' cash, Chillin' in Unova,
Kickin' ass in a flash, we put em in a coma
So don't bother come round' fuck with me and mine
Me and my Pokemon'll quickly fuckin' end your life
X2

[Verse 2: Dextro]
Arrive like Gary Oak
And my presence ain't a joke
And I'll leave em fuckin' broke
After we're finished with the battle
Leave their mind states rattled
And the confusion sets in
Champ of the world
Now its time to get rich
Eight badges and I'm in
Now it's time to begin
Six balls fuckin' deep
There's no way I can't win
Let em have it
Yeah that's how we do
Mastermind shit
There's no fuckin' with the real crew

[Hook]
