As I went a walking on Kilgary Mountain
I spied Colonel Pepper and his money he was countin'
I rattled out my pistols and I drew forth my saber
Cryin' Stand and deliver for I am a bold deceiver

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar

The gold and silver coins they looked so bright and shiny
Oh I took them home straightway and I gave 'em to my Molly
She vowed and she promised that she never would deceive me
But the devil's in the women oh you never can believe 'em

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar

But when I awoke between six and seven
The guards were all around me in numbers odd and even
I reached for my pistols but alas I was mistaken
My pistols had been fired and a prisoner I was taken

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar

They put me in the jail without judge or writin'
For robbing Colonel Pepper oh on Kilgary Mountain
But they didn't take my fists so I knocked the sentry down
And bade farewell to the jail in Sligo town

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar

Some people take delight in fishin' and in bowlin'
Oh others take delight in the carriages a rollin'
But I take delight in the juice of the barley
And courtin' pretty girls 'til the morning so early

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar

Musha rain dum a doo dum a da
Whack for my daddy o
Whack for my daddy o
There's whiskey in the jar
