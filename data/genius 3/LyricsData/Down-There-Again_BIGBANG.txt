The way im feeling right now
Is going straight to hell
This way you make me feel you moved on when I fell

And when I'm about to clean myself thinking
This shouldn't last but in the end
You'll turn around smiling
And I know
You got me down there again
You got me down there again

The clouds are moving faster
I get up and I can't walk
Right by your side I'll be gliding alone with no talk

And when I'm about to clean myself
Thinking this shouldn't last
But in the end
You'll turn around smiling
And I know
You got me down there again
You got me down there again

I'm thinking of placing myself now
I'm with you feeling good
And why do I never give you all that I could

And when im about to clean myself
Thinking this shouldn't last
But in the end
You'll turn around smiling
And I know
You got me down there again
You got me down there again
