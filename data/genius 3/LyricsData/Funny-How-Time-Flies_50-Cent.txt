[Intro]
I know what she like, I know what she want, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
My bitch just like me so I know she wanna stunt
A taste of the good life, yeah, I know what she want
A trip to PR, sex in the car, floating diamonds shabar
Call us hood, it's all good, that's what we are
Find an exotic space to visit, chinchilla, gator-lizid
That's how a nigga gets it when I'm on my shizzit
Bright lights, city life, a nigga so flashy
Have you like “Damn! That Ferrari flew past me!”
So fast a nigga don't know limits
Had a bad bitch in it, I can see it wasn't tinted
Get the money then spend it, break rules or bend it
To my liking, I move like a viking
A warrior, I shouldn't mean more to you
I'm the American dream, one man regime
Shorty love me like she love new shoes
Insecure, so she investigate me like the feds, ooh

[Hook]
Funny how time flies when we're making love
It goes on and on and on, we just can't go wrong

[Verse 2]
They can smile, they can frown, they can love it, they can hate it
They can wish bad shit on us, it's cool, we made it
Look at me to see the Lord's blessings while they stressing
Switch whips, push the Bugatti through the recession
It's just me and you, I can see it clear
Police coming, I need you to stash this pistol here
It's all hood, you hesitate they'll put our life on pause
It's a common wealth state, baby, they make up laws
Fuck CMB, it's you and me, baby, we all we got
I say we gon' make it, they sayin' we not
Yeah, but they don't know I'm meant for you, they don't know how you're into me
They don't know shit about how we bond mentally
Their relationships are oh so basic
They can't understand how we do and how we say shit
So blunt, don't front, I got you open
It's the original G shit, you know how we get, duck down

[Hook]
