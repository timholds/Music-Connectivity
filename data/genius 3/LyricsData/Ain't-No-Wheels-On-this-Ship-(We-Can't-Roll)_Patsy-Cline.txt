[Verse 1]
I used to have big money
That was many moons ago
You used to call me honey
Now you call me so and so

[Chorus]
Because there ain't no wheels on this ship
And we can't roll, roll, roll
We can't roll, roll, roll
We can't roll

[Verse 2]
You used to be big papa
The cat of every ball
Now listen, little papa
You done had your big downfall

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You used to like my loving
Because you liked my dough
Now you don't want my loving
Because there ain't no dough no more

[Chorus]l

[Verse 4]
Well, I'll tell you for the last time
And I've told you this before
If you want to keep your mama
You got to love me more and more

[Chorus]
