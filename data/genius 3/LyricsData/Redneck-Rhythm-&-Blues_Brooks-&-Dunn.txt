[Verse 1]
Well good God o'mighty this week's been two months long
Lord I love to hear that Friday five o'clock whistle moan
As the moon comes up and the sun goes down
Put the juice to my truck I head into town
Get it on and go to grooving to the redneck rhythm & blues

[Chorus]
Life ain't all hard knocks a quarter in the jukebox
Turn it on and set 'em up Joe
Songs about a workin' man blarin' from a bandstand
Is music to a country boy's soul
Call me the underdog of overtime
I stay broke all the time
Gotta pay the eight to five dues
Well I'm hillbilly hardcore
Son I'm a sucker for the redneck rhythm & blues

[Verse 2]
There's nothing worse than the rattle and roll of empty cans
Bouncin' around in the bed of my truck
Boy I'm a thirsty man
Five hot long miles to the waterin' hole
I got the pedal to the metal singin' go cat go
Aw a cool one is a cure for the redneck rhythm & blues

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Yeah I'm hillbilly hardcore
Son I'm a sucker for the redneck rhythm & blues
