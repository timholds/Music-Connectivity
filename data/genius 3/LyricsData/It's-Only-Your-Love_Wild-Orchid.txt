In your heart I'll always find my home
In your arms I'll find my comfort
In your eyes I feel my deepest strength
So I fear no rain nor thunder,no
No one else so inspired me
You are my breath
You're my every thing

It's only your love
That fills me all up
That heals me all up
It's all that I know
My heart and my soul
It's only your love
You've given meaning to my every song
And made my life the sweetest music
You've held me up, you have made me strong
And I thank God you chose to do it
And now I'm flying like the egeals do
It's all because of this
It's all because of you

It's only your love
That fills me all up
That heals me all up
It's all I know
My heart and my soul
Its only your love
It's only your love
That made my life so clear
When I found you I found myself
I'll love you for a million years
There's no one else

It's only your love
That fills me all up
That heals me all up
It's all that I know
My heart and my soul
It's only your love
It's only your love

It's only your love
That fills me all up
That heals me all up
It's all that I know
My heart and my soul
It's only your love
It's only your love

It's only your love
That fills me all up
That heals me all up
It's all that I know
My heart and my soul
It's only your love
It's only your love
