[Hook: C-John]
Don't you see the world that we live in
Pain from our societies to sickness
I see no light in the distance
Maybe this is the new difference

[Verse 1: C-John]
The time inspects into new elements
They told me keep it cool connect and get relevant
My words speak the truth they fall ahead of me
My dreams are to make this world better and reach my destiny
I was told that people will hate you. rate you. and also break you
But how strong you stand is what makes you
And your also afraid to show your sins that are hateful
How can I live young boy in the streets
My neighbors make like no bread, life is hard it got no ends
Same with us too, momma paying bills
Me and my brother share a room. No drama keep it chill
We don't get what we want we gotta work for it
We gotta grind on our own turf for it, go through dirt for it
We ain't got the designer clothes we just kids from the ghetto
Neighbors dealing this and the neighbors dealing that
One friend went to juvie man i got his back

[Hook: C-John]
Don't you see the world that we live in
Pain from our societies to sickness
I see no light in the distance
Maybe this is the new difference

[Verse 2 : ARMAGEDDON]
My neighborhood it raised me
My neighborhood it made me
My neighborhood is changing
My neighborhood needs Savin'
My neighborhood was never good, you can't get out, you really should
The streets were cracked, neighbors selling crack
What the fuck is that
Always growing up knew I had to find a way out
Couldn't stay here forever, dreams of a big house
But I know dreams are just dreams now
So I made a goal
A goal that I'll see out
Gotta see my way out
I done spent years now
Working towards this college shit
I better not squander it
Gotta keep my scholarship
Cus honestly, know we can't really be affording it
But I'm not ever forfeiting, gotta go right in , gotta hold this pen
Gotta write these rhymes, gotta right these wrongs
Gotta stand up strong, gotta just keep just going
I know I gotta make these songs
Stand up for my neighborhood, while everyone else is gone

[Hook: C-John]
Don't you see the world that we live in
Pain from our societies to sickness
I see no light in the distance
Maybe this is the new difference
