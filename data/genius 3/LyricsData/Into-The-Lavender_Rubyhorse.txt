If I was a star
Would you believe me?
If I fell apart
Undone at the seams

Would you take me over
Would you take on me
Take make away

Into the lavender
She brings me down
When she's around
Under the setting sun
We burned away
We jumped the gun

If I dug a hole
Would you fill it in
If I sold my soul
To the higest bid

Would you take me over
Would you take on me
Take me away

Into the lavender
She brings me down
When she's around
Under the setting sun
We burned away
We jumped the gun

She soothes me
Who's on to me
She brings me down

Into the lavender
She brings me down
When she's around
Under the setting sun
We burned away
We jumped the gun, yeah

Whoa....

Into the lavender she brings me down
She brings me
Into the lavender she brings me down
She brings me
Into the lavender she brings me down
She brings me down
