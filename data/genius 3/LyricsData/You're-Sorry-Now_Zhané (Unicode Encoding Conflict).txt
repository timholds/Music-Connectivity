[Verse 1]
Sometimes I wonder what it is you want from me
The words "I'm sorry" come from you so sensitively
We've been through this before
Time and time I say there's gotta be a better way

[Pre-Chorus]
You're coming in and out
In and out and out of my life
Trying to patch up the old memories
Of trouble and strife
You're telling me, oh please baby
I'm so very sorry
Come with something better
Are you ever, ever, ever gonna change

[Chorus]
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart

[Verse 2]
You always come around when it's too late
You can't win back my love 'cause baby, I can wait
You want me more and more
My life is moving on
There's gotta be a better way

[Pre-Chorus]
You're coming in and out
In and out and out of my life
Trying to patch up the old memories
Of trouble and strife
You're telling me, oh please baby
I'm so very sorry
Come with something better
Are you ever, ever, ever gonna change

[Chorus]
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart

[Bridge]
I'm so tired
I want you out of my life
Stop saying sorry
Because it's all over between us, baby
I'm so tired
I want you out of my life
Stop saying sorry
Because it's all over between us, baby

[Chorus]
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart
You're sorry now
But sorry won't relieve the pain of a broken heart
