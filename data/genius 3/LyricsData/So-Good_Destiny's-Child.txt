[Verse 1: Beyonce]

Hey how ya doin', yeah I'm doin' mighty fine
Last time I seen ya, it's been a long time
Stop smilin' at me, get that look off your face
Please don't even front, stop bein' so fake
I know you do not like me and you made it very clear
You're always talkin' about me from what I hear
Always put me down when you thought that you could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

[Hook: Kelly]

Wasn't it you that said
Thought I was all that and you said I didn't have a clue
Wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't make it through
And wasn't it you that said
That I didn't look too good, that I wouldn't do too good
I'd never make it out the 'hood
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

[Chorus:]

So good, so good, so good
I know you hate it, but I'm
So good, so good, so good
So good, so good, so good
It's hard to face it, but I'm
So good, so good, so good

[Verse 2: Beyonce]

This is for them haters that said we wouldn't make it
Now we doin' platinum and now you can't take it
For all the people 'round us that have been negative
Look at us now and see how we live
I stayed down wit' my people, all the ones that keep it real
Didn't get caught up, and how that make you feel?
All the things I'm doin' that you thought I never could
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

[Hook 2: Kelly]

Wasn't it you that said
I thought I was all that and you said I didn't have a clue
Wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't make it through
And wasn't it you that said
That I wouldn't do too good
Look at me, now ain't God good
Now I made it out the 'hood
I want you to know that I'm doin' so good

[Repeat Chorus]

[Beyonce:]
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so good
Good, good, good, good, good

I'm doing so, so, so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so, so, so
I'm doing so, so, so, so, so, so, so good
Good, good, good, good, good

[Repeat Chorus until fade]
