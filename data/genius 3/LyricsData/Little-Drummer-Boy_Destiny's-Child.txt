Come they told me
Pa rum pum pum pum
A new born King to see
Pa rum pum pum pum
Our finest gifts we bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
To lay before the King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum

Little Baby
Pa rum pum pum pum
I am a poor girl too
Pa rum pum pum pum
I have no gift to bring
Pa rum pum pum pum
That's fit to give our King
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum

Shall I play for you
Pa rum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum

Mary nodded
Pa rum pum pum pum
The ox and lamb kept time
Little drummer boy
I played my drum for Him
Pa rum pum pum
I played my best for Him
Pa rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum
Rum pum pum pum

Then he smiled at me
Pa rum pum pum pum
Me and my drum
