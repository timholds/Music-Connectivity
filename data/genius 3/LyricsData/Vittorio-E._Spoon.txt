[Chorus]
I took a river and it wouldn't let go
I want you to stay and I want you to go
I took a river and the river was long and it goes on

[Verse]
I want to be there tonight
I want to get there but it's just out of sight
I took a river and felt so slight so hold on

[Bridge]
So hold on
N goes on
It goes on

[Chorus]
I took a river and the river was long
I want you to stay course I want you to go
I took a river and the river was long and goes on

[Outro]
It goes on
Ooh it goes on
It goes on
