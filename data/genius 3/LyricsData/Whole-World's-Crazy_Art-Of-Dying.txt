He’s just a kid on the street
Got it tough trying to make ends meet
So high on low self-esteem
Nowhere to wake up with no place to sleep
I pass him by every week
Offer change and hope he forgives me
But will I ever know his name, will I ever know

Is the whole world crazy now
The whole world’s crazy now
I don’t wanna believe there’s no way out
Is the whole world crazy now

She’s got a kid at thirteen
He stole her innocence and fled the scene
Disowned by a daddy who drinks
They found her there by the bathroom sink
Will I ever know her name, will I ever know

Is the whole world crazy now
The whole world’s crazy now
I don’t wanna believe there’s no way out
Is the whole world crazy now

I see your face even with my eyes shut
I see your face, but will I ever know
I see your face even with my eyes shut
I see your face, but will I ever know that I don’t even know your name

Is the whole world crazy now
Is the whole world crazy now
I don’t wanna believe there’s no way out
Don’t wanna believe it's over

I don't want to believe there's no way out
Is the whole world crazy now?
