[COMPANY]
Thanks for coming to see our show
Sad to tell you we got to go
Grab your hat and head for the door
In case you didn't notice, there ain't anymore!

If you like our show, tell ev'ry one but
If you think it stinks, keep your big mouth shut!

We're glad you came but we have to shout
Adios, au revoir, wiedersehen, ta-ta-ta
Goodbye, get lost, get out!
