I won't be consumed by your heart
Chew me up, spit me out, swallowed by the gob, no the gob can't touch me now
Most spray lies like fountain of youth
I base this on truths, distort the view and -
Would I be here if she kept my yout?
A young teen father, searching for a miracle
A fallen star of a wish that will get me through these digitized times where they lives so pitiful
Cut the cord (umbilical) it's time to leave my home town
Watch me grow, please brother no frowns
Sometimes I feel like I'm melting
Like I just blew my brains out
Blaow, blaow, blaow! That's the way down
But I'm trying to stay up there
Lusting for life of those that are not tears
This pen bleeds for you
Can you hear me, in my dreams try to speak to you
But you never acknowledge, you just see right through
Did you smell that bunch of flowers that we left on your grave?
My brothers need guidance, they're being led astray
I do too, I'm no angel, don't lie
Even though your daughter told me aim for the lights
Head down that path, keep to the right
But I took my own path, relieve the plight
Can't tell the difference 'tween the trees and the grass
A road in the past, a blade in my heart
I keep it raw: rough around the edges
Fuck striving for perfection penning Led Zeppelin
My mind's a deadly weapon, kill em in a millisecond
Some touched by my words though I never even met them
Relax - let the soul set in
DELS signing out see you on the next setting...

I won't get swallowed by the gob
Swallowed by the darkness
Swallowed by the fog
I'm reaching out cause I'm lost, cause I'm trying to find my way and lift off
It won't be long
I won't get swallowed by the, swallowed by the
I won't get swallowed by the gob
I won't get swallowed by your darkness
And swallowed by your fog
I won't get swallowed by the gob
Swallowed by the darkness
Swallowed by the fog
I'm reaching out cause I'm lost, trying to find my way and lift off
It won't be long
I won't get swallowed by the, swallowed by the
I won't get swallowed by the gob
I won't get swallowed by your darkness
I won't get swallowed by your fog
I won't get swallowed by the gob
Swallowed by the darkness
Swallowed by the fog
I'm reaching out cause I'm lost, trying to find my way and lift off
It won't be long
I won't get swallowed by the gob
Swallowed by the darkness
Swallowed by the fog
I'm reaching out cause I'm lost, trying to find my way and lift off
It won't be long
Gob
