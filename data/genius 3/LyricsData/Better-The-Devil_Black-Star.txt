(Blackstar;Walker)
I have made my bed and now it is time to lie down
Dark clown eternal with a permanent wry frown
Still holding out with pessimistic hope
Better the devil you know than the one that you do not
Better the devil you know than the one that you do not
I should have known
I should have known
Better the devil you know than the one that you do not
I know I know
I should have known
I should have known
Better the devil you know than the one that you do not
Hold your loved ones close and your enemies closer
I guess they never ever come any colder
Lash it out give them enough rope
Better the devil you know than the one that you do not
