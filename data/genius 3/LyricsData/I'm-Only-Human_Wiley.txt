[Intro]
Lifes hard for a better day i've been wishing
I thank god that i'm alive and that i'm not in prison
Somebody told me something and i had to listen
When yours is bad as someone out there in a worse position
Even though it's hard i smile through the bad weather
Smile on bad days even though i've had better
In school i was cool, i worked mad clever
Out of school i had to deal with some mad pressure
More advanced than the kids in my age group
I don't do the same things that they do
I told em thank a lark i made you
Whatever you do just stay true
Even when im feeling in the worst way
Smiling so much you'd believe it was my birthday
Happy, i just wanna be that
Me sad? Haters wanna see that
Look either

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like the weight of the worlds on my shoulders
And i still smile even when i feel i can't go on much longer
I'm only human and i hope you understand
I'm only human, doing the best i can
Oh oh oh oh oh-uh-oh(repeat)
Thinking back on when my life was easy (easy)
Whenever i was hungry they would feed me (feed me)
I couldn't even speak, didn't even have teeth, but they understood it's like they could read me
Talking 'bout the days when i was just a baby
Young, stress, free with a heart full of bravery
At times im in solo, it amaze me
I can still have a smile like they intergrade me
I sit and think about having a baby girl
And all the stress of bringing her up in this crazy world
What if i don't blow and music doesn't pay me well
Ive been through pain but i just smile through the pain i felt
In the house of pain but me still work out
And leave my haters wih nothin to talk 'bout
Believe me im far from psychic
But i got a feeling my life still cyclin

[Chorus]
Sometimes it feels like the weight of the worlds on my shoulders
And i still smile even when i feel i can't go on much longer
I'm only human and i hope you understand
I'm only human, doing the best i can
Oh oh oh oh oh-uh-oh(repeat)

Whether your a worker or your a student
Remember there's always room for improvement
I examined the world and made a conclusion
I'm a boy, you're a girl
We're only human
On this life journey
Some are only cruising
While the others speed to the point of confusion
When you feeling like you can't face it
Just remember life's what you make it
I'm only human
I hope you can understand
All i do is try, to do the best i can
And im only human its not my fault i try my best
