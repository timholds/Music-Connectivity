Chorus (Raj Chrome)
All of my Life
Roll another backwoods lemme get this off of my chest
All of my life
Runnin' through my old hood, even when I'm down I feel blessed
All of my life
King without a crown but I'm gunning everybody else down
All of my life
Look up to the sky
Got the power in my eyes
And I'm shinin' all of my life
