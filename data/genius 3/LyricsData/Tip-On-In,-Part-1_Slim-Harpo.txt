Ooh, lay it on me, baby
Don't stop now
Let your hair down, baby
We ain't goin' to heaven, no how
I'm ready to burn, baby
Right here and now

Whoa, I dig those crazy clothes
Let me feel those fish-net hose
Cut low at the top
And high at the bottom
In fact, I don't see
How we ever did without 'em

Now, there's a place down the street
They call 'The Tippin' In'
Let's walk on down there, baby
That's where the fun begin
But let me check you just one mo' time
Mmm-umm-mm!

You know you send me, baby
Let's go on in here
Now, sock it to me!
Woo-ooo-wee!
You know this gettin' good to me, now?
Aaw, shuck!
