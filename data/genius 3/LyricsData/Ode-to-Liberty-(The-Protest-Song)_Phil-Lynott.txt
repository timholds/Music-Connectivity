The dream was not a vision or some premonition like we were told
It was no figment of the imagination to prove that we could be bought or sold
The doctor of the diamond run could be revealed to the intelligent
But this is what i resent who cares for the ignorant the intelligent
The cynics approach was mean who cares for anything in this whole wide world except me?
And this opinion must not confuse the issue my appearance my condition or state of delivery
I am stating the obvious
This is a protest
There must be a conclusion this is no shakespearean speech
This is a statement made by one who cannot practice what he preaches
The statue of liberty has engraved on its wall
Give me your poor give me your needy give me them all
We need something like this
For this world to coexist
It would be so easy
To act so pretentious
To act as if it was hypocrisy
To act condescending
When in fact it's the world we're mending
And that's why i can't relax
'cause inside my coat it's a pistol that i pack
We must beware of a surprise nuclear attack
We must be ready to strike back
I'm not pretending
Our defence needs clearly mending
We must leave those standing
Forget the third world is ending
Is starving
Is crying
Is desolate
Is oh so late
I would dearly love to return
Through a mirror in twenty years
And learn what the future has in store for us
And if i learned that we lost
And there was no hope
For those that fight
I would turn to drink
And drink is drugs
And drugs would help me sink
And like a boat i float
I sail out to the sky
To the universe and back
Maybe to give it another try
I don't know why why jack
Just to confirm our father
Just to learn just to heal us
