[Verse 1]
This can't be life
I pray to God
To watch my family almost every night
Shots fired Sunday night
Its Wednesday
My cousin still fighting for his life
I know my brother wanna buss some shots in the air
And maybe hit one of them niggas just to make it all fair
But instead I tell him say prayer
Damn
Who I'ma lose this year
Shed a tear
For my niggas that ain't here
I really hope all of my niggas make it this year
The Young Godfather
Don Corleone
I move swiftly
Vision clear as the ocean
I can tell you niggas fishy
I mean what happened to the unit
These niggas so 50
They get oliver "the ghost"
When they see that you griffey
Its impossible to be friendly
When niggas envy
Whoa
Its kind of crazy
But its the way of life
But then again
Sometimes I wonder man
This can't life

[Verse 2]
Heart racing
While I'm waiting
Hands shaking
I'm mask'd up like Jason
Mentally debating
But my family aching
Hop out the car
Its kind of too late decision making
Next thing I know
I'm staring right into the eyes of the life I'm taken
This can't be lie
