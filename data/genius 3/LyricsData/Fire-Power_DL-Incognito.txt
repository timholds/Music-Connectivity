Yo coward
Feel the power of the english language
DL brings the fury like them gang bangers
Niggas in danger, to chanel my anger
Directed to the micro, I used to play with Tyco
But now I rock the mic yo, a sample and drum machine is all that is needed
Your keyboard is defeated, production gets deleted
By the king keep the analog sound tell you niggas
We move with the strength of silver back gorillas
Haters they still feel us but that's just the how it is
I'm great like the start of something big B.I.G
Niggas should have never let me grab the M.I.C
I'm just trying to do the right thing like spike lee, I might be
The greatest in the future, nigga don't be a loser
Fucking buy my shit right now
It's and underground classic you want in your collection
Hip hop's been dead for years, witness the resurrection
Its the rebirth of real style, we kept it on foul
No longer will you have to wait to pop your Crystal
I'm live like Jordan's number 5 and 6, my LP full of loops that probably click
And A and R's can't seem to find talent for shit
Your record's weak but you managed to bang out a hit, now
Now what I do is full length, hip hop with strength
I only got my staff to thank, yo we Nine Planets hip hop take it to the bank
Yo the fire that you got is fucking blanks, we move like tanks
