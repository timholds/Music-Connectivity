I want to live a pure life
I’d say that it’s about the time
Don’t judge me for the things I’ve done
To get off the only one
The place I’ve found in ignorance
A slow burning of Icarus
I fear I am resigned
To the sky and up my mind

Oh boy, I can’t hurt you anymore
Oh boy, I can’t hurt you anymore
Oh boy, I can’t hurt you anymore
Lord knows, I hurt my love, my love

To be so blind I could not see
The savior right in front of me
Sanctuary in his kiss
Instead confined to end our bliss
Cause every time you think of me
The black covers what might be
The...no, no, calm that drone
Together but all alone

Oh boy, I can’t hurt you anymore
Oh boy, I can’t hurt you anymore
Oh boy, I can’t hurt you anymore
Lord knows, I hurt my love, my love

The tracks of time, the tracks of tears
When love is smothered out in fear
Gonna hate until the call
The day we wake up feeling clear

Oh boy, I can’t hurt you anymore
Oh boy, I can’t hurt you anymore
Oh boy, I can’t hurt you anymore
Lord knows, I hurt my love, my love
