[Intro: Swae Lee]
Did you have the time of your life?
Let's have the after party at my place
Do you have some spare change?
On me I've got hundreds I'll throw in your face

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young free and wildin', order more kidneys

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Dope, Iâ€™m so dope
All these honeys pilin' on the floor
And we're stuntin', know you see the GLO
Girl these hundreds, thought I'd let you know
Since LA, I've been puttin' on
Cirque Du Soleil, on and on and on
I got this money, tell me what you want
For this money, can you drop it low?

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young free and wildin', order more kidneys
When the night calls, oooh
When the night calls, oooh
Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young free and wildin', so order more kidneys

[Verse 2: Swae Lee]
Freaks come out at night
We bring our fantasy to life
Point me to the ice
And I don't need your drank, high off life
Someone kill the lights
I brought the party favors, just get piped
All my bitches right
But I want you and you tonight

[Bridge: Travis Scott]
Yeah, order more bottles, order more models
Order more hours, shots on an island
Hotter than the summer, the winter couldn't chill me
Young free and wildin', so order more kidneys

[Hook: Travis Scott]
When the night crawls
All the money, all the hoes and the alcohol
All these hundreds and these thousands I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night calls
We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol
All these hundreds all these thousands I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls

[Verse 3: Chief Keef]
Aye, walked up in the bank, ordered me some funds
Walked in the strip club, order me some ones
I walked up in the gun store, order me some guns
Your bitch walked up in the spot and she ordered me for lunch
I just ordered me some brunch, Korean spicy garlic
Bitch I come from eating McDonald's
Girl you know I'm from the projects
I'm a G I come through ma like Wu-T-A-N-G we come through wildin'
I ain't chillin, Caesar with the chopper, boy you don't blow no poles, I know
I got me some angles
I got me some money for
I got me some haters
I got me some fed ex, I got me some cake
I got me some UPS, I got me a freight
Order some more money, order some more money
Order some more money, order some more bottles
Order some more bitches, order some more money
I know you want to be rich, bitch

[Hook: Travis Scott]
When the night crawls
All the money, all the hoes and the alcohol
All these hundreds and these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night calls
We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol
All these hundreds, all these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night crawls
All the money, all the hoes and the alcohol
All these hundreds and these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
When the night calls
We want money, we want hoes, we want alcohol
All these hundreds, all these thousands, I'ma spend it all
Always when the night calls
