Now and then, I look where I've been
Seems the good sometimes went wrong
I see in you the love that pulled me through
The love that kept me strong

You saved my life when drowning in a lonely sea
You reached out and rescued me
You saved my life
With love you saved my life

You been there when no one dared to care
Somehow you shield me from all harm
Oh, a guiding light in my darkest night
You, you are my shelter in the storm

You, you saved my life
When all around was sinking sand
You were there with outstretched hands
You saved my life, with love you saved my life

With nothing to gain, you bared my pain
From the start you showed me love from the heart
When all else fails, all faith in you I held
Yes, my life, my soul, I owe it to you
I owe it to you, I owe it to you

You saved my life, it took time but now I see
Your love supplies all my needs
You saved my life
I said with love you saved my life

Don't know what I'd do without you
Saved my life
