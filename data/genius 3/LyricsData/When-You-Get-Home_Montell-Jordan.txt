Keep on makin' it hot
Keep on makin' it hot
Keep on makin' it hot
Keep on makin' it hot
Keep on makin' it hot
Keep on makin' it hot
Keep on makin' it hot

You're facinating, yet mysterious
So captivating
I'm just curious
Is heaven missing you?
Cause Lord knows when you're gone...I do
So when you get home girl

1 - When you get home tonight
Here's what I'd like to do
Start in the shower, massage ya
Till you're in the mood
When you get home tonight
Girl, I'll show you
I want you (want you baby)
And I want you to want me too

Girl, your shower's ready
Steamy hot for you
Crystal popped for two
To get you in the mood
I'll sing like Marvin Gaye
Cause girl I want you more
Every single day (tell me)

Who, who loves you baby, more than I do?
Maybe God above
And who, takes good care of you
When you're lonely?
You're my tender love
Oh girl

Repeat 1

When you get home

Repeat 1

Who, who loves you baby, more than I do?
Maybe God above
And who, takes good care of you
When you're lonely?
Tender lover, come on home

All you lovely ladies
All around the world
Baby I want you
Do you want me too?
All you sexy ladies
All around the world
Baby I want you
Do you want me too?

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

When you get home tonight
