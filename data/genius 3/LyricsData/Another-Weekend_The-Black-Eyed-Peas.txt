[Intro]
Weekend come for, the weekend come
Weekend come for, the weekend come
Weekend come for, the weekend come
We can't wait for the weekend come
Hey [32x]

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I called Tab on Wednesday night
So we could make plans for Thursday night
He said "We could go hit the Peapods"
I was like yeah, that's my favorite spot
Plus I like it there, cause I got love on the list
High powered juice where I don't even get frisked
Walk up in the place and get hugs from the misses
Pounds from my brothers cause they knowin that this is
The place to be to let it all out
But when the weekend come, the weekend come...
... y'all could come
So go tell ya momma come and ya poppa come
Go to spin the record so we can get dumb
Place packed, capacity maximum
Due to my man Polo Promotion
And I can't wait to go out and hear some

[Hook: Esthero]
Jumping music, swift DJ's
Smoke machines and laser rays
Look out weekend cause, here I come
Because weekends were, werrrre

[Verse 2: apl.de.ap]
Walked in the club at like 10 o'clock
And the spot is hot, blowin up rooftops
This is Thursday night and the night is young
Four day weekend, time to have some fun
Deejays cut it up, drop them joints
Everybody's been waitin to dance and make noise
B-boys, let me see you break it down
And ladies, let your hips move around
It's the sound of the B-E-P family
Got a poet named Life and a sister Kimmy
And the blood of Abraham
So let's get ready for the jam

[Hook: Esthero]
Jumping music, swift DJ's
Smoke machines and laser rays
Look out weekend cause, here I come
Because weekends were, werrrre

[Bridge]
It was a Thursday night and the party was bumpin
And the bass was thumpin and people was jumpin
And Taboo's at the front door comin
Taboo's at the front door comiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiin, and
And (here he come now)
And.. nah, nah, nah

[Verse 3: Taboo]
Yo, Mister will.i.am (Mister will.i.am)
When oh when (Mister will.i.am)
Get our boogie on when the weekend COME
Check the Peapod, cause the vibes is STRONG
Salinas, Filipinas, they come one by ONE
All lined up, and they ready for FUN
Short ones, tall ones, beautiful ONES
B-boys, b-girls, ready to WHAT?

[Verse 4: will.i.am]
Breakin and shakin when we doing our ish
J-Rock from the Beat Junkies ready to mix
Cause they cuttin up the wax for everybody
Come on over cause were having a party
We lightin up the sky with the burning STAR
Throw your hands in the air, if you know who you ARE
Cause we jumpin around with the Broshigeez
And get blessed by the Beat Pharmacy
Cause they hittin you with

[Hook: Esthero]
Jumping music, swift DJ's
Smoke machines and laser rays
Look out weekend cause, here I come
Because weekends were, werrrre
