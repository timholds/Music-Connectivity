In sheets of gold under autumn skies
On top of the world the happy prince cries

Another tear
In a voice only a swallow can hear
Could you help me now, get things right
Take my sapphire eyes, fly off and hand them out
We're not the only ones

We feel lost and get carried away
When we listen to what our friends say
We walk the earth like a man on a wire
While kids run in a field of fire

What can we do
When the world comes knocking to remind us of
Our lives are fragile and could end just so
Could happen to you, and happen to me

Covered in sheets of gold under autumn skies
On top of the world the happy prince cries
You're not the only one, we're not the only one

We try to hide behind the song
The story's old and the words are wrong
And the guarantee to bring you right down
So love your heart more than your crown
You don't have to sing, or say any thing

When the world comes knocking to remind us of
Our lives are fragile and could end just so
Could happen to you, and happen to me

Covered in sheets of gold under autumn skies
On top of the world the happy prince cries
You're not the only one, we're not the only one

When the world comes knocking to remind us of

Our lives are fragile and could end just so
Could happen to you, and happen to me

Covered in sheets of gold under autumn skies
On top of the world the happy prince cries
You don't have to sing, or say anything
