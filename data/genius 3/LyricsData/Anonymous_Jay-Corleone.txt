[Verse 1: Jay V]
Askin questions, like
You the fuckin feds and shit
To you my name it don't exist
In fact, my names anonymous
Sellin dro on the lo'
My location never known
These feds wanna' catch me but, can't tap my other phone
It's Jay Vicious on the mic
But in the streets anonymous
Never harassed by a pig, youngin' looking innocent
But i'm sellin pack and shit
To potheads tryna' get mad lit
Ballin' off the hustle
Got a rack invested in myself
I believe in stacking cheese
Or otherwise just growing wealth
Creeping with them goons
Rollin heard before you die
After death taste the so called
Pie, in the sky
Now how ya feel?
How ya feelin'
That sinnin' villain in sin city
Make bones shake
Cold feelin'
From a G' that, likes, to, lurk in the shadows
Guerrilla tactics my battle
It works
So hop on the saddle
Or be a  victim of the vet
That's a threat with, knifes & burners at yo neck
Bout to blast til(haa)
Facial hair disintegrated
Thanks to whom participated
But now i'm takin over
On a high throne.....
And i'm never feeling sober
