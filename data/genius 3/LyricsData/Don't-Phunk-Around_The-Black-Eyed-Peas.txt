[Intro]
No, no, no, no
Don't phunk with my heart... (yeah!)

[Hook One]
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby.. in love, baby
I wonder if I take you home
Would you still be in love, baby.. in love, baby

[Verse One]
Girl, you know you got me, got me
With your pistol shot me, shot me
And I'm here helplessly
In love and nothing can stop me
You can't stop me cause once I start it
Can't return me cause once you bought it
I'm coming baby, don't got it (don't make me wait)
So let's be about it
(No, no, no, no)
(Don't phunk with my heart)
Baby, have some trustin, trustin
When I come in lustin, lustin
Cause I bring you that comfort
I ain't only here cause I want yer
Body I want your mind too
Interesting's what I find you
And I'm interested in the long haul
Come on girl - YEEHAW! (C'mon)

[Hook One]

(No, no, no, no)
(Don't phunk with my heart)

[Verse Two]
Girl, you had me once you kissed me
My love for you is not iffy
I always want you with me
I'll play Bobby and you'll play Whitney
If you smoke, I'll smoke too
That's how much I'm in love wit'chu
Crazy is what crazy do
Crazy in love, I'm a crazy fool
(No, no, no, no)
(Don't phunk with my heart)
Why are you so in-se-cure
When you got passion and love her
You always claimin I'm a cheater
Think I'd up and go leave ya
For another senorita
You forgot that I need ya
You must've caught amnesia
That's why you don't believe-a, brother
Yeah, check it out

[Hook Two]
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, baby
Cause you know you got me by a string, baby
Don't you worry 'bout a thing, baby
Cause you know you got me by a string, baby

[Interlude]
Baby girl, you make me feel
You know you make me feel so real
I love you more than your sex appeal, cause you're
That-tha, that tha, that-tha, that girl {*7X*}

[Overlapping last 2X]
No, no, no, no, don't phunk with my heart {*2X*}
That-tha, that tha, that-tha, that girl

[Hook One] - 2X
