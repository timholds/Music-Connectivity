Lately I don't know
But somethings coming over me
Thoughts of stirring up
'bout stirring up a drink or three
I'm down to go, where the wind blows
So come and follow
Don't wanna leave ya babe
Leave ya babe
So please baby

We could fly
Up, up, up , up high
Blue sky
Up, up, up, up high
Feel the high
Come and take ride
Above the stars were going far

If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody put down your latte
Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise

No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consalation, only sensation
Paradise

Where the water is so clear
That you can see your feet
Dropping coins
In my nature by the coral reef
In every natural treasures
From mother nature
We are so welathy now, wealthy now
Tell me now

Say goodbye
Buh, buh, buh, buh-bye
To all the tries
Buh, buh, buh, buh-bye
Relax your mind
Open up a wine
And then explore
I'll show you more

If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody put down your latte
Throw your work aside and come to
Paradise

No frustration on this vacation
This destination, this correlation
No consalation, only sensation
Paradise

If you wanted to have a party
Come on everybody put down your latte
