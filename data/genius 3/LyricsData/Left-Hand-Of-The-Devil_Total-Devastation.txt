He clears her lifeless corpse from the bed
He leaves her lying cold and dead
There comes trouble with blue eyes
Ready to kill, ready to humiliate

His soul is black
He's the cause of death
You met something evil
Left hand of the devil

Bullet burns through your chest
The left has spoken so they say
Life crawls from your body
As you wait your purgatory

Welcome to your funeral
He makes you die again and again
