[Verse 1]
Could wait all night and day
To go to a party
Sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ
Because my song he's got to play (Please play my song)
And when I hear that beat
I get my body up out my seat
Grab a guy and move my feet
He's playing my song

[Chorus]
Play, come on
Play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on DJ
Play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ just play that song)
Just turn it up and turn it on
DJ, just play that song
Cause I wanna be dancing (DJ) all night long
Play my, play my, play my favorite song

[Verse 2]
I don't care if everybody's gone
Turn it up
Cause it turns me on
Keep dancing all night long
Feels so right that it can't be wrong (can't be wrong)
I get the chills up and down my spine
Whenever I hear that song of mine
When it stops better press rewind (play that shit, man!)
Let me hear it
One more time

[Chorus]
Play, come on
Play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn it on
Play, come on DJ
Play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ just play that song)
Cause I wanna be dancing all night long (you know this song)
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up, and turn it on (just play one more time)
Play, come on DJ play that song
You know that it turns me on (DJ just play that song)
Cause I wanna be dancing all night long

[Spoken]
I just want to dance, is that a crime?
Alright then
(Yeah that's the hotness right here)
Play, come on DJ play
Play that song
You know that it turns me on
(Now mr. DJ I've asked you 3 times already just play my motherfuckin' song!)

[Chorus x4]
Play, come on play that song
Play it all night long
Just turn it up and turn me on
Play, come on DJ play that song
You know that it turns me on
(DJ just play that song)
Just turn it up and turn me on
