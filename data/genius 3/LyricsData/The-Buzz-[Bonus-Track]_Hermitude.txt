[Intro: Mataya]
Do you feel it, feel it?
Feel it, feel it?
Do you feel it in the air, air?
Air, air
Do you feel it, feel it?
Do you feel it, feel it?
I can feel it in the air, air, air
Air, air, air

[PreChorus 1: Young Tapz]
Do you feel the buzz or is it just me, trust me
Something in the air, just above me
Something like a dream state
You call it a clean break
Do you feel the buzz, baby?
Do you feel the buzz?

[Verse 1: Big K.R.I.T.]
Uh
I feel it in the air like kush clouds
Stuck to the ceiling come get it down
Rollin' on the ground with eyes tight and all
Slow motion weed and shit we had to crawl
Like a lette, lette, lette
We don't know just how to act, act, act
When we on this level
All I know is bass, see it in your face
When the 15 like it we ain't trippin' on treble
Round and round we go
Lights flashin in this atmosphere
When I'm seeing double I get into trouble
But your body like crystal clear
So what's happenin', shorty?
Picture perfect, no caption, shorty
Just askin', shorty
Let's get lost tonight
Then away it go
Like what's happenin', shorty, 'cause you feel it

[Bridge: Mataya]
Do you feel it?
Do you feel it in the air?
Air
Is it just me?
Me
Do you feel it?
I can feel it in the air
Is it just me?
Is it just me?

[PreChorus 2: Young Tapz]
Do you feel the buzz or is it just me, just me?
Something in the air, it's just above me
Something like a dream state
I can't even see straight
Do you feel the buzz, babe?
Do you feel the buzz?

[Outro: Young Tapz & *Mataya*]
I feel it, baby
*I can feel it, I can, I can feel it in the*
*I can feel it in the air*
I feel it, baby
*I can feel it in the*
*I can, I can feel it in the air, air*
Do you feel the buzz?
*I can feel it in the*
*I can, I can feel it in the air, air, air*
*Is it just me?*
*Feel it in the, I can, I can feel it in the air*
Yeah, do you feel the buzz?
