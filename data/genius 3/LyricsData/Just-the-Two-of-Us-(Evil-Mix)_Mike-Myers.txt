[Dr. Evil]
This is a very sensitive subject

Ooooooooh

Just the two of us (yeah)
Just the two of us (Mmm-hmm)

[Dr. Evil]
From the moment I heard Frau say I had a clone
I knew that I'd be safe, cuz I'd never be alone
An evil doctor shouldn't speak a lot about his feeling
My hurt and my pain don't make me too appealing
I hoped Scott would look up to me
Run da buisness of the family
Have an evil empire just like his dear old Dad
Gave him my love and the things I never had
Scott would think I was a cool guy
Return the love I have, make me want to cry
Be Eviiiiil, but have my feelings too
Change my love wit Oprah and Maya Angeloo
But Scott rejected me, c'est la vie
Life is cruel, treats you unfairly
Even so, a God there must be
Mini-Me, you complete me

Chorus:

Just the two of us (uh-huh)
We can make it (yeah) if we try
Just the two of us
Just me and you
Just me and you
Getting Jiggy with it (ha ha)
J-u-ust the two of us (yeaaah)
(Hmm)
Building castles in da sky
J-u-u-st the two of us
(You and I)
J-u-u-u-u-st the two of us
Whoo!
Uh!
Ha Ha Ha Ha
Daddy loves you
Daddy loves you
Whoo
Uh
Ha ha
Just the two of us
You and I
