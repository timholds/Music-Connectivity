Ladies take it to the dance flo', this yo song
Girl get ya dance on
Ladies take it to the flo', this yo shit
Urbody nina pop in this bitch

[Verse 1: Kemo]
Now count up all homies where we stayed, on the blocks
When I add em all up in my head, its a lot (whole lot)
Now we to fill up in the spot, is the plot
Lemme see what ya got, shake it watch the homies flock
When ya, break it on in, make the grown men
Hit the flo' and beat her faithfully like a liqour sto'
(What? she a wrist to glow?)
I got no chest to blow, never was a trick
I never kissed her under no mistletoe
Givin me a picture show, baby girl I got a blistered toe
But you shakin that ass, like Mystikal
Put you in a figure fo', she listen to the Da Hol' 9
Everytime she on the grind wit a fist of dough
Call me Mr. Mo, add you to my list of hoes
You can take a ride and you can fly right away with the Crow
Say she never missed a show, what I'ma diss her fo'
When she shake that ass she make it pop just like a pistol
(BOO-Y!)
