Everybody got a hole in their ass
Thinkin’ you gonna burry me
Everywhere I go I see purple dicks
It’s kind of disturbing me
I steal with my niggas
Ain't shit changed but the money and the days of the week
I'm still with my niggas boy you know this ‘til the death of me
With money comes power, these bitches know the recipe
Niggas are falling
They think these guys are helping me
These niggas starvin’
And there is no loyalty
