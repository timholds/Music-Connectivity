[Verse 1]
These honky tonks and bright lights used to thrill me
I'd paint the town and stumble in at dawn
But now there's no one listening for my footsteps
And it's winding down to one more night alone

[Chorus]
I thought I had her wrapped around my finger
I didn't think this bridge would ever burn
I always thought she'd take me back
But she taught me the cold hard fact
When it comes to love, I've got a lot to learn

[Verse 2]
It never crossed my mind that she might leave me
She did her best to love me till the end
If she were here, I know I'd treat her better
But I won't ever get that chance again

[Chorus]

[Outro]
When it comes to love, I've got a lot to learn
Oh, when it comes to love, I've got a lot to learn
