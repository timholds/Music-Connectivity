(Verse)
Ever since I was a youngin
Up in my grandmamma house
Watchin a mack reciting it bad
Like ho wutchu talkin bout
Droppin a switch, hittin a lick
Tryna get rich off in this bitch
Go from my top, I pop in my trunk
I’m whippin my will like I’m whippin my criss
These niggas ain’t shit, these niggas ain’t real
These niggas is frauds
Most of these niggas been coughing kush and loving all on they broads
When I pull up, car slam a do’, break a ho down
When I go kill it so, pat that ho high
I say hold up, damn
KRIT that fucked up, I know it
They say hold up, damn
Quickly pour up, I throw it
I, I, I, I’m feeling good, feeling great
How are you?
Show much space when I pop my tape
Can’t feel my face, can you feel yours too?
I got this here, I got this here
Right after chopped that in
Pussy bit, she swallow the dick
Right after mop they lip
She say what’s head, I’m tryna fuck
Right after profedo
Bout that dough, got that up
Don’t act no shy, bitch slap it up

(Bridge)
I need that (I need that)
I want that (I want that)
I’m bout that (I’m bout that)
What’s happenin? (What’s happenin?)
I seen that (I seen that)
I bought that (I bought that)
I own that (I own that)
I’m snappy (I’m snappy)

(Hook)
Yall niggas ain’t talkin bout nothing
Not a thing, not a not a thing ho
Yall niggas ain’t talkin bout nothing
Not a thing, not a not a thing ho
Yall niggas ain’t talkin bout nothing
Not a thing, not a not a thing ho
Yall niggas ain’t talkin bout nothing
That I can’t do, that you done done that I ain’t did

(Verse)
Ain’t nobody trippin on yo ho, ain’t into that
Ain’t nobody trippin on yo ho, I give er back
Cut er slack, let er go, cuz she was in the VI
Ain’t like I be askin for attention when I be
Got so much tip that I can’t see
Yall stressin busses with they feet out
If you ain’t suckin or fuckin
Well, you should keep up
Shoot the kind of bill, when they buss it gotta be by
She ain’t gotta beg, if she lookin I can see
Right on that V, I drop yo tea top
Hater tend to levy
The bottles servin, poppin, Shawty look at all that we got
Look at all that we on
Tell them blokes just be gone
Fuck wutchu been talkin bout, they catch up with my feet
Don’t make no love for these haters, ain’t no love for these fakes
What? There’s a bone in the country, I ain’t trippin on a snake
If they fishin for some bitches
All I hear was here was bait
If you think you got a problem with it, tell it to my face

(Bridge)
I need that (I need that)
I want that (I want that)
I’m bout that (I’m bout that)
What’s happenin? (What’s happenin?)
I seen that (I seen that)
I bought that (I bought that)
I own that (I own that)
I’m snappy (I’m snappy)

(Hook)

Not a thing, not a not a thing ho
Yall niggas ain’t talkin bout nothing
Not a thing, not a not a thing ho
Yall niggas ain’t talkin bout nothing
