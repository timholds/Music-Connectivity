Woke up in the garden
Very late this morning
Struggling & yawning
Creepy crawlies creeping

My mouth is dry
But my face is wet
From the morning dew
I've had more than a few

Tried to pull myself up
Roses point and laugh at me
Got this pain across my arm
Red armies stung me greatly

My mouth is dry
But my face is wet
From the tears from my eyes
I tilt my head to the sky

What am I going to do
To get myself out of this mess?
Tulip said "to get hold of yourself"
And this is what he said

Get get up
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
Get get up
Or in no time you will wither just like my old self

Get get up
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
Get get up
Or in no time you will wither

(.............)

Get get up
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
Get get up
Or in no time you will wither just like my old self

Get get up
Stop feeling sorry for yourself
Get get up
Or in no time you will wither
