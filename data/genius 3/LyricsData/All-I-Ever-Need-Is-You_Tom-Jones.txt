Sometimes when I'm sad and all alone
Just like a child without a home
The love you give me keeps me hanging on
Oh, darling, all I ever need is you

You're my first love....You're my last
You're my future....You're my past
Loving you is all I ask, oh, honey
All I ever need is you

Winters come and winters go
And we watch the melting snow
Sure as summer follows spring
All the things you do
Gives me a reason to build my
World around you

Some men follow rainbows, I am told
Some men search for silver, some for gold
But I found my treasure in your soul
Oh, baby, all I ever need is you

You know that without love
I'd never find a way
Through the ups and downs
Of everyday
And I won't sleep at night
Until I hear you say
Oh, baby, all I ever need is you

Ooh...
But I found my treasure in your soul
All I ever need is you
You know that without love
I'd never find a way
Through the ups and downs
Of everyday

And I won't sleep a wink
Until I hear you say
Oh, baby, all I ever need is you

Oh, darling, all I ever need is you
Oh, honey, all I ever need is you
Uh, yeh, you know what I mean
Uh, hmmmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Just a little bit...just a little bit
Just a little bit...just a little bit
'Cause all I ever need is you...
