[* Group Harmonizing *]

[Chorus 1 x2]
Na na na, Na na na
Turn me down when I asked to dance
You don't get no second chance girl

[Verse 1]
Raced up to the scene one night
The party was jumping, no fright
The ladies were looking so tight
A particular one caught my eye
I asked if she wanted to groove
She clowned me with her attitude
She found out I roll with a crew
Now there's nothing she wouldn't do
To be down with me
It's unfortunate that you
Missed out on a good thing like me
You thought I was a buster
But you do it around the scene
Now you heard I was from the O
Now you got the vapors
Blowing up my pager

[Chorus 2 x2]
Girl you don't get no second chance
Cause you turned me down when I asked to dance
Now you wanna go through cause your girls told you
That I was down with the crew

[Verse 2]
So when I asked you to dance
I couldn't even believe that
You told me no
Now I got to go
No ifs ands or buts
Just beat it, beat it
You played the game and you lose
Now guess who's ringing on my line
Begging me for another try
It's too late so bye bye
Playing these games so many ways to play
I bet you never thought you'd see this day
Dry your eyes don't be feeling bluw
Cause I know you never thought I'd be the one dogging you

[Chorus 2 x2]

[Verse 3]
There's no second chance
When I ask you to dance
There's no second chance
When you play with romance
You're a victim of your own circumstance
There's no second chance
There's no second chance
When I ask you to dance
There's no second chance
When you play with romance
You're a victim of your own circumstance
There's no second chance

[Chorus 1 to fade]
