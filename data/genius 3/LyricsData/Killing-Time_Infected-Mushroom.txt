[Verse]
In my dreams
I can kill you
Close to me
You open the cage and he sets you free
Come to me
We run away forever from this misery
Lost my mind
Are you calling me

[Chorus]
Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
I'm always falling down

Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
It's coming for you now

[Verse]
So how can it be
The color of the world had turned dark for me
Falling free
Losing my reflection and my clarity
Talk to me
I feel the sickness taking over me
Let me be
Imagining that you are here with me

[Chorus]
Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
I'm always falling down

Killing time that I left behind
Everything changes to a point that it stops and it turns around
It's coming for you now
