On the 8th day of Christmas my baby gave to me:
A pair of Chloe shades and a diamond belly ring
On the 7th day of Christmas my baby gave to me:
A nice back rub then he massaged my feet
On the 6th day of Christmas my baby gave to me:
A crop jacket with dirty denim jeans
On the 5th day of Christmas my baby gave to me:
The poem that he wrote for me

[Pre-Chorus]
The feeling that I feel is
So good
He makes me
Feel so in
La-la-la-love
If he only knew what he does to me
My man, my man, my baby
Oh he makes me feel so lovely, so sexy
I'm so in la-la-la-love
How I love him for his generosity
My man, my man, my baby

[Chorus]
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (it feels lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (feels so lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (oh oh oh oh)
Yes, it feels like Christmas
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (it feels lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (feels so lovely)
Doesn't it feel like Christmas (the spirit of Christmas)
Yes, it feels like Christmas

A candle-lit dinner, just for me and my honey

The keys to a CLK Mercedes
On the 1st day of Christmas my baby gave to me:
Quality T-I-M-E

[Pre-Chorus]
The feeling that I feel is
So good
He makes me
Feel so in
La-la-la-love
If he only knew what he does to me
My man, my man, my baby
Oh he makes me feel so lovely, so sexy
I'm so in la-la-la-love
How I love him for his generosity
My man, my man, my baby
