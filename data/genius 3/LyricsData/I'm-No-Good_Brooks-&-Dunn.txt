[Verse]
I got whiskey to keep me warm
When the sun goes down
And this godforsaken honky tonk
Ain't likely to run out
So won't you come on home and save me
Stop me before I drown
Because I'm no good, pretty mama
When you're not around
And there's women in this town
Whispering in my ear
Saying things a man
In my condition likes to hear
So won't you come on home and stop me
Before I step on out
'Cause I'm no good, pretty mama
When you're not around
Well, I'm helpless when I'm tempted
And I'm headed straight for hell
Oh, I've got no resistance
The Devil knows me well
So won't you come on home, sweet darling
Oh, Lord I need you now
Because I'm no good, pretty mama
When you're not around
Now there's a southbound calling me
Further down the track
And if I get on board that train
Well, I'm never coming back
So won't you meet me at the station
Tie my boot heels down
Because I'm no good, pretty mama
When you're not around

[Outro]
No, I'm no good, pretty mama
When you're not around
