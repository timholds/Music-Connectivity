[Verse 1]
Saw an old friend last night I hadn't seen in a couple of years
Stopped in Galatoire's had a couple of beers
An' talked about the price of oysters, the coach at LSU
Then like I knew it would the conversation turned to you

[Verse 2]
He had to go and I looked at my watch, it was 1:45
I headed down Canal, the quarter was comin' alive
A man on the corner told me that Jesus was comin' soon
But I was lost in the music and the crowd, and the smell of cheap perfume

[Chorus 1]
It's not good for a... a man to be alone
But, a women needs someone that, she can count on
And I... I walked down by the river in the cold gray dawn
Love is like the Mississippi, when she's gone... she's gone

[Verse 2]
The line was long at Cafe Du Monde so I walked out on the pier
Thought about all the winds and turns, and mistakes that got me here
I might as well try to change the course this old river takes
Than to go back in time when you were mine, pretend it's not late

[Chorus 2]
It's not good for a... a man to be alone
But, a women needs someone that... that she can count on
And what I'd give to go back, but the current's just too strong
And love is like the Mississippi, when she's gone... she's gone

[Interlude]

[Chorus 2]
It's not good for a... a man to be alone
But, a women needs someone that... she can count on
And what I'd give to go back, but the current's just too strong
And love is like the Mississippi, when she's gone... she's gone

[Outro]
Yeah, she's gone
