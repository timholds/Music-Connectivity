[Verse 1: Chester Bennington]
Caught up against the wall again
Tied and chained to the ball again
Never seems to amaze my mind
So I just sleep (sleep)...sleep (sleep)...sleep
Please don't

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Wake me 'til the morning after
Wake me 'til the morning after

[Verse 2: Chester Bennington]
Cut and bruised by the fall again
Lick my wounds like a dog again
Is that a light at the end of the tunnel
That I see (see) I see (see)
Please let it be but don't

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Wake me 'til the morning after
Wake me 'til the morning after

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Wake me 'til the morning after
I'm so tired
There has got to be an end
To the pain I feel when I'm awake and alive...alive...alive
Alive and I'm dreamin'

[Verse 3: Chester Bennington]
Caught up against the wall again
Tied and chained to the ball again
Never seems to amaze my mind
So I just sleep (sleep)
Sleep (sleep)
Sleep
Please don't

[Chorus: Chester Bennington]
Wake me till the morning after
Wake me till the morning after

[Bridge: Chester Bennington]
Wake me till the morning after
I'm so tired there has got to be an end
To the pain I feel
When I'm awake and alive...alive...alive
Alive and I'm dreamin'
