[Intro]
I want you all to go to your windows
Go to your windows and yell out
Scream with all the life that you can muster up inside your bruised, assaulted and battered bodies:
"I am sick and tired of being a nigga!"

[Hook]
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the government
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them white folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them black folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the world
I don't wanna be another nigga

[Verse 1]
Waitin' with my hands out
Broke in the hood, they give a damn 'bout
Braggin' to my homies 'bout the hoes I fucked
Drinkin' bottles after bottle, plus I smoke too much
I never had a job that would pay me well
I took what I could cause they gave me hell
Spend what I stole on some clothes and kicks
My ex-girl say I won't amount to shit
But she suck and fuck when my car roll up
Tried to fuck her sister but she talk too much
Her mama shake her head whenever I come 'round
Whatever high I had when I saw her might come down
I barely go to church but I say I will
I bow my head right before I eat my meal
The world's fucked up and they claimin' I'm to blame
It's a damn shame, cause

[Hook]
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the government
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them white folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them black folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the world
I don't wanna be another nigga

[Verse 2]
Waitin' on a play to come through
Chillin' with my homeboys plottin' on you
Watchin' movies how to come up quick
Recruiting young niggas I can come up with
Barely read books, but they down to shoot
Live life breaking rules, they got something to prove
Parents ain't around they got nothing to lose
Wave the tool on a fool for some brand new shoes
Little child runnin' wild in the streets
Wanna be a G so he look up to me
Try to hit the block and make a name
Claim he caught a body now he got it and he feeling all the same
Till the family of the victim come knocking
Bailing through the corners of the ghetto till they shot him
Youth still dyin' and they claimin' I'm to blame
It's a damn shame, cause

[Hook]
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the government
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them white folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them black folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the world
I don't wanna be another nigga

[Verse 3]
Always trying to sell you something
Don't really know shit, but trying to tell you something
Tap dance if you want him to
Coulda' fed the hungry but he bought them jewels
Won't ever look back cause he gotta keep movin'
Even if he leave his own people Bamboozled
Takin' credit like he did it by himself
Too much pride to realize that he really had help
Only judge a man by his wealth
He ain't me so he can't feel how I felt
He saw me walkin' and he ain't look back - too scared
We make eye contact:
So he can say he didn't see me when he drove by
And I could say he didn't see me and it's alright
He just want the fame from the game, it's a shame
I bet he think I'm just another nigga

[Hook]
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the government
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them white folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell them black folk
I don't wanna be another nigga
Tell the world
I don't wanna be another nigga
