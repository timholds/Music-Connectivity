[Verse 1]
Hey, girl, stop what you're doing!
Hey, girl, you'll drive me to ruin
I don't know what it is that I like about you, but I like it a lot
Won't let me hold you, let me feel your loving charms

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown drive me insane!

[Verse 2]
Hey, girl, I got something I think you ought to know
Hey, babe, I wanna tell you that I love you so
I wanna hold you in my arms, yeah!
I'm never gonna let you go, cause I like your charms

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown drive me insane!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Communication breakdown, it's always the same
I'm having a nervous breakdown drive me insane!

[Outro]
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
Communication breakdown
