[Verse 1]
Ever since this world of ours began
Man's been killing off his fellow man, yeah
Cursing and swearing and threatening the other side
As he waves flags and symbols saying 'Peace to all mankind'
Lord, the air is foul with the smell of hypocrisy
As bloody armies scream, screams for victory
Lying there in the mire is a mama and child
Their anguished cries trampled by boots on either side

[[?] Solo]

[Verse 2]
Now with bloodshot eyes we look out beyond earth's gate
Seeking new planets to plant seeds of hate, yeah
Progress, it's said, makes for a softer bed, mmm
But no one will lie easy if everyone lies dead
Now it's time, I think, and I think you'll agree, oh
To love thy neighbor and set all men free
So take the shackles from the wings of the dying dove
And permit her to fly away to peace and love, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Spoken: [?]]
As I lay in death-like in the path of war, my eyes chanced to open and there, far above the waste land, a solitary blood-stained bird strained to make the heavens. "Sanctuary, sanctuary" I thought she cried. As the weeping clouds looked down upon her, a rainbow came to guide her. The heavens did receive her as all souls rejoiced.
