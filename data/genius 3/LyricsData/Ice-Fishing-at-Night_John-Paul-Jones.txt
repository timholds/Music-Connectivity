Ice fishing at night
What a wonderful sight
Fish come out of hibernation
And swim up towards the light

The blubber lanterns lure them
Brighter than the moon
They swim up to face the gaffer hook
And the sharp harpoon

Thinking that it's springtime
Thinking that it's dawn
Think that it will soon
Be time to spawn

Ice fishing at night
What a wonderful sight
Ice fishing at night
Ice fishing at night
