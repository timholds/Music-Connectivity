Where did it go? I don't know
Where is it now?
Where is it now?
Time hides things. Lies hide things. I hide things. I lose things
Where did it go? I don't know
Where has it gone? Where has it gone?
Time hides things. Lies hide things. I lose things. I break things. I forget. I fall away
I'm tired
I'm tired...
