We?re coming from far and wide
We're singing a song to you
Gather us together
For cake and candle light
The red heifer is here
And cousins of twelve tribes
Count up all our faces
Divide up the cake in pieces

We?ve all come here to see
Happy birthday Jubilee

I?m going to hold you tight
Sing and dance all night
We?re all so happy
We?re happy for you
This is what we brought you
We made a promise for you
Go have fun tonight
We?ve got your back remember

We?ve all come here to see
Happy birthday Jubilee

This is the place!
This is a place to work
This is a name
This is a rock
This is my bride
She?s beautiful inside and outside
This is a song, yet to be sung
Song yet to be sung

It?s your birthday party
It?s your birthday party

We?re coming from far and wide
We're singing a song to you
Gather us together
For cake and candle light
The red heifer is here
And cousins of twelve tribes
Count up all our faces
Divide up the cake in pieces

We?ve all come here to see
Happy birthday Jubilee

It's your birth, your birthday party
Your birth, your birthday party
Your birthday, party
Your birthday, party
Your birthday, party
