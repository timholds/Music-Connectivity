Discourse like a machine gun I'm hunting rabbits for their tails
Not lying or pretending just counting circles with square eyes
And everything you ever said is everything gone wrong tonight
And everything you ever said is everything gone wrong
Mood lighting won't fix it even rabid dogs have their day
I'm not lying be deceiving I'm hunting rabbits for their tails
And everything you ever said is everything gone wrong tonight
And everything you ever said is everything gone wrong tonight
And everything you ever said is everything gone wrong tonight
And everything you ever said is everything gone wrong tonight
Thing gone wrong tonight thing gone wrong tonight
