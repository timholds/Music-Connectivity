My baby's teething in the den

And I'm to give him what's mine

He wasn't meant to walk with men

(doctors brought him round again)

In his eyes there is a cure

To all the troubles in this home

It'll haunt my every bone

Force me through the great unknown

With a different name

In a different place

And a different way

Living different days

With a rifle to stay

A rifle to go

Find a fire to tend

And a martyr to mend

Find a body to bend

In a million ways

'til the thrill of a million

Has faded away

With the birth of a child

Comes the end of an age

Like turning a phrase

That erases a rage
