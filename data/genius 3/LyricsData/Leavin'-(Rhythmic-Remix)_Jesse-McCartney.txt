Jesse McCartney
Hey baby girl, I've been watching you all day (all day x3)
Man that thing you got behind you is amazing (amazing x3)
You make me want to take you out and let it rain (let it rain x3)
I know you got a man but this is what you should say

Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never lookin' back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry, no more them gray skies
Girl we flying on the G5 G5
And believe in never lookin back again
So call your shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so so fly, the one that keep you high
Have me singing all night like like
Oh oh oh oh repeat man she gon' be singin
Oh oh oh oh oh repeat

Now if I talk it girl, you know that I will walk it out (walk it out x3)
Man I'll put my money (money) where my mouth is (mouth is x3)
Cause you the baddest little thing that I've ever seen (ever seen x3)
So I'm a ask you one time if you got a man

Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never lookin' back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry, no more them gray skies
Girl we flying on the G5 G5
And believe in never lookin back again
So call your shawty and tell him you found a new man
The one who's so so fly, the one that keep you high
Have me singing all night like like
Oh oh oh oh oh repeat man she gon' be singin
She gon' be singin, she gon' be singin, she gon' be singin oh you gon' be singin
Oh oh oh oh repeat

Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Just tell him to the left left left
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Cause we gone, and we gone, and we gone

Baby Bash
Now you can tell him Sayonara and holla Asta llauego

Tell that boy to get rocks get coast hit the blocks
Cause I found someone that'll hit the spot
Someone that you dig a lot
So then kick it with me and let's go vacation
Stress free, drama free in a foreign nation
Anywhere the water at

Ain't no more I ain't holding back
