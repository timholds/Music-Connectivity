[Truth Hurts]
I decided I'ma get my shit together, mhhm
Deal with the truth, I call the rules
I've got somethin' to say (woow)
(Well) well
Now I believe when it's real, you got to face it, yeaah
It's called the truth I think I heard somebody saaayin
This waaay

Let the truth be told
Let the truth be told (told)
Let the truth be told
Let the truth be told (told)

I say... (tooold)
Let the truth be told!

{*beat changing*}

[Dr. Dre] (Truth Hurts)
Yo
Do yall wanna know the truth?
The niggas can't handle the truth
In fact, they scared of it
See let me explain somethin to ya
Truth is...
These niggas seein that we at it again
Straight up to work this magic again
So can I get a witness?
Except us on some pimp shit
Introducin Truth to the world
They ain't ready for this soulful singer like a real bitch supposed to
Music you can coast to
Put it on when them hatin niggas roll through
Not fake, not false like the average
Nobody's fuckin takin advantage
She's out to do damage
To all yall R'n'B bitches
(Yes I am)
Ain't hard for her to see bitches
Even the words you think is key bitches
(Here I am)
I told yall, well if i haven't sold yall
Keep your ear to the street
You bitches have no idea what I'm about to unleash
And if you're wondering where's the proof
You should wait no longer cuz here's the truth

[Truth Hurts] (Dr. Dre)
Who's hot
They not
That's why
I drop this shit
You cop
Put mine on... ???
Things just ain't gone be the same
Niggas who truth put up in the game
What was yall doin before? (Bullshittin'?)
If you didn't, now you know
I just don't understand why niggas settle less than number
