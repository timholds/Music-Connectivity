[Chorus:]
We’re going all in tonight
Raise your glass to the ceiling
Neon lights and damn good times and that’s what I’m feeling
Take out the keys, unlock the door
And we ain’t stopping ‘till we hit the floor
We’re going all in, all in tonight

[Verse 1:]
Well, it looks like a country party, everybody grab somebody
Short or tall, fat or thin, everybody’s all in
Gonna have a whole damn redneck throw down
A shot for shot, showdown, right here in the old town
Do you wanna dance a little two step to the field?
Get your drink on, ‘cause tonight is the night you’ve been waiting for
Hit the floor, bartender, one more, I think I’ll never go in

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Well, it’s too late, oh, well, my buddy
He’s gonna tell, the whole crowd is in
Tonight you know how we do
It’s just another weekend hanging with my loudy friends
Jack, Jim, all in, full or half, all in
Everybody’s somebody
This is that one party gonna talk about it for the rest of the year
Get a beer, sip some shine, grab my girl
But not mine, everything will be fine if you just sing along

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
We’re going all in tonight, raise your glass to the ceiling
Neon lights and damn good times and that’s what I’m feeling
Take out the keys, unlock the door and we ain’t stopping ‘till we hit the floor
We’re going all in, all in tonight[x2]
