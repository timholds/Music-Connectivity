The letters you wrote me had hollow point headers
If you think you've got it like that find somebody better
You said I need fixing, you numbered the stages
But I won't be living in one of your cages
Open your mind and understand

When you're hard on me it's not what I need
We were meant to be untamed
Up on my feet, born to run free
And there's nobody's taming me

I'm outgrown the narrow protective container
Designed to be opened with your childish behavior
'Cause you're not the critic of personal purpose
And I'm just not willing to do community service
I don't know why you lay it on

When you're hard on me it's not what I need
We were meant to be untamed
Up on my feet, born to run free
And there's nobody's taming me

You say that I should lend a shoulder
Right now, 'cause your whole world is blowing up
Go ahead, but I won't be your soldier
'Cause you're the one who started up
You're the one who started up

When you're hard on me it's not what I need
We were meant to be untamed
Up on my feet, born to run free
And there's nobody's taming me

When you're hard on me it's not what I need
We were meant to be untamed
Up on my feet, born to run free
And there's nobody's taming me

We were meant, we were meant to be untamed
We were meant, we were meant to be, we were meant to be untamed
We were meant, we were meant to be, we were meant to be untamed
Oh, oh
