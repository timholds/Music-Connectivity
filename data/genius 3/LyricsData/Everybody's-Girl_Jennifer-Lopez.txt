[Verse 1]
Let's play a game
Let's just pretend like you don't know who I am
Believe it if you say that you're not a fan
Act like I'm interested in some other man, man, man
Turn on the lights
So that the cameras flashing won't be so bright
Ain't like the crowd ain't getting big outside
They're wanting details on how I live my life, my life, my life

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love her?

[Verse 2]
Out through the back
Too many people blocking the front door
We go our different ways so we want more
Another gig I got in until four

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love her?

[Bridge]
I love it, I love it
Cool as summer cool
I'm flying and I love it
She just wants to be seen
Can you hang onto a shooting star?
Handle distance near and far
Don't let the jealousy and envy get to you
Cause I'll be running home right back to you

[Chorus]
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Somebody loved by everybody?
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love a girl?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love her?
Can you love a girl, can you love a girl, can you love a girl?
