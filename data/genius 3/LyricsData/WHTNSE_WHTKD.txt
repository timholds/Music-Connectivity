Yeaaaah, eeeeeeheh
Yeaaaaah, eeeeyhehe

(Chorus)
I know you're smart
You spin me round like a knot
You know the pieces, pieces of my heart
Sometimes it's fun, you pull my strings one by one
Until you get me, get me, into one, one

Beatdrop (8x)
Into one, one
Into into, one
Into one, get me into one, one

Yeaaaah, eeeeeeheh
Yeaaaaah, eeeeyhehe

(Chorus)
I know you're smart
You spin me round like a knot
You know the pieces, pieces of my heart
Sometimes it's fun, you pull my strings one by one
Until you get me, get me, into one, one

Beatdrop (8x)
Into one, one
Into into, one
Into one, get me into one, one
