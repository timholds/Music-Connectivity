Umbrellas and booze reminds me of you
'Cause you're a summer rain
The city got cold
And you let me know
I couldn't make you stay

I spend my nights going back in time
To when we loved the most
Leaves on the ground, the sun's going down
But I still want you close

[Chorus]
You're the light in the morning
You're the sky when I'm grey
In my mind it's still pouring
Every day, every day, every day you're my summer rain

Oh, God, I'm a mess
Straight-jacket obssessed
Not getting over you
This city's too quite
Can't hold back tonight
You got me so confused

I spend my nights going back in time
To when we loved the most

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I know we said it was only for fun
Fell in love with the sun
But it set on me
I can't believe I was letting you go
Without letting you know
How I really feel

[Chorus]

In my mind it's still pouring
Every day, every day, every day you're my summer rain
