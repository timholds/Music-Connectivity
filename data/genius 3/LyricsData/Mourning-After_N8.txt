Met you on Wednesday, saw you on Thursday
Saw you on Friday, spent the night
Met you the next day, will you be with me?
You’ll take a few days, then you’ll write

Then comes Sunday. Sunday she calls me
I am still lonely, and I break
You see me broken, you don’t want broken
You have been mended, afraid to break

My heart lifts up and calls your name
I never thought I’d feel the same
Again, again, again, I’m lost
Again, again, again, I’m lost

This week I’m busy. Tell you I’m sorry
Meet you on Tuesday, spent the night
You break on Wednesday, but you don’t tell me
You leave me waiting…

Thursday and Friday, inside I’m dying
Finally you tell me, and I break
I know it’s not me, but you were amazing
Too good to let go, so I’ll wait

I know you have to feel the same
We both recurse back into pain
Again, again, again, I’m lost
Again, again, again, I’m lost

I’m so sorry, please don’t hate me
Please don’t hate me, I beg you
My honesty, my honesty
And honestly, here’s the truth:

I’m so lucky, I’m so lucky
I’m so lucky, to know you
I’m not ready, I’m not ready
I’m not ready, to know you

You need some time now
I hardly blame you
I think we both do…
