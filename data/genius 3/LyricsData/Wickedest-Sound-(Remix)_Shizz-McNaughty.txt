[Intro: 140Aks]
Yeah, aight, say no more, cool, I am not new to this

[Verse 1: 140Aks]
Yo, tek this ting for
Really we're never going investing bring war, think more
Nothing ain't stronger than your family name
So I'll fight to the death with my limbs torn
I move with those that choose to be like-mind
Big up Izzie, man, he threw me a lifeline
Don't worry, soon it'll be my time
Sis prays for me cause I move in the nighttime
With the snakes and the rats and the roaches
Hating like man isn't noticed
Them man are raging but Aks is too focused
I ain't on waiting, it's damn time I go in
Like haven't you noticed? It's the Aks campaign
I'm back and hungry like the Axeman days
It's facts man spray, I'll disect you, boy
Check The Grime Show, I'm a direct rudeboy
3 in a row just like your shizz said
Can't pitch me in the road, I'm not a victim
They don't wanna see me involved cause I'm the kingpin
Trust me, I'm bringing it, bro, you're not the in ting
And what you reckon it was level what you thinking
Told you already that you better have fixing
I'll get Shizz in, forehead missing
Listen, we got a brotherhood like we're from Ipswich

[Verse 2: Blittz]
Yo, bloodclart G inna dis, give gyal the wickedest
Chilling where your Mrs is, shoving my dick in it
That's bless, she scream Jesus lord
When I dip, I get her wet like a christening
Enforced discipline, if you wanna fuck around
You better be protected, I'm sicker than syphilis
Man are tryna mock it, you could never war the realest
Push your wig back if you ever wanna be slick
Aks had to get me on a remix
You all think you're clever, you should dead it and delete it
Have you while I'm stepping, you can tell it's not a neat ting
Uppercut'll wake him up at seven in the evening
Scheming, tryna settle all my demons
If I pull pressure on release then fuck them
[?] cut through the pumps with dumb tekkers
Anybody want it, you can come get us

[Verse 3: Shizz McNaughty]
When I'm at you
Up in the bits, don't think you're a bad yout
Bad karma, know the years'll catch you
Make a grown man [?] on his stag do
9 to 5 working in a shop
Management sacked you cause I came and attacked you
Circulate your ends when I'm in a bad mood
When I'm hot-tempered, there's nothing you can do
You'll be get left in forest
Man are from Hamlets, got dons in Waltham Forest
And I've got dons in Harringay
When it's big man talking, you don't have a say
When man's gone, [?] ran away
I'm a heavyweight, wickedest sound, let me demonstrate
It's not easy, but I make it look easy
What you gonna do when you see me?
Nothing, but you gonna go on like you man are on scuffing
You must be buzzing
The only time that you're a star and you're bussing
Only tryna get on TV hollering cuh they cussing
It's not nang, you ain't got us in
On the wrong day, I might rush him
Give him drinks like a white Russian
E3 in our own league
So it's not my shoulders that you're brushing

[Verse 4: Mercston]
The wickedest sound come out of E3
I pushed that T, no malice, without a CV
Might see me ankles out
In brown loafers and the three-piece
Last time me and Shizz was on a riddim
I had a black BlackBerry Bold full of women
Dun know that's my little bro
Back from shitting the natty, a snotty nose
[?] better know
My nigga Paddy, I was staying here with my granny
Way before I got a bit of fanny
Now pssh, I don't want it if it's baggy, nah, nah
But is there any exclusive? Nah, nah, I don't know
Even when they got a man, I'm around
Back to the sound, man's been a champion
Tell dem man a simmer down, see mi foot, see mi yah, nah

[Verse 5: Izzie Gibbs]
Homies try hold 'em, my soul is so broken
And colder, who done told 'em?
Flow's so potent, opponents, I might ghost 'em
Moments shown I was chosen to go golden
Evolved in a roll, with a sword, you've been blown open
The posters and fold 'em, for when you get soaked in [?]
Can somebody control him?
I'm not giving a fuck, I be ripping it up
That's Hulk Hogan
You're a legend like Aks is
You chat shit but don't @ Izz
I'm in the field, man's active
Yo, who'd wanna go at Izz?
Real talk, you need practice
'Nuff corn for them, madness
Head back, catch this
I'll fuck your girl on your mattress

[Verse 6: Capo Lee]
Yeah, I'm not the one to go against
Bring your whole defence or take it down a peg like
If I ain't spurring on mic
More like need it, I'm doing the road again
I'm zone again, addictive flows like opium
I came back harder than most of them, yo
I don't care how you [?]
It's all Aks, Shizz original
Me, I come through with the north side flavour
Running round town with your uni loan
Your 4G ran out, you need more than data
Keep it real with the wickedest sound and
Be patient, it'll draw you paper
See me, I no argue online
Got a champion flow that'll shut down a hater, Capo
