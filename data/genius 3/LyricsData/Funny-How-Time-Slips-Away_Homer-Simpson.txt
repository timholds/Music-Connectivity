Well hello there
My it's been a long, long time
How am I doin'?
I guess that I'm doin' fine

It's been so long now and it seems
Now it was only yesterday
Ain't it funny how time slips away

How's your new love
I hope that he's doin' fine
I heard you told him that
You'd love him till the end of time

Now that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day
Ain't it funny how time slips away

I gotta go now
I guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town

But remember what I tell
In time you're gonna pay
It's surprising how time slips away

Ain't it funny how time slips away
