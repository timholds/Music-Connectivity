(Gd: Yea)
(Sr) The love I'm feeling (You know girl)
Is just simply amazing (Just simply amazing)
Need you in my life (I need you)
Don't throw this away
(Say I love you, don't cha)

(Yb)Girl, girl, you're so fly, oh my (Gd: Girl, girl, you're so fly, oh my)
I, I need you by my side (I said I need you girl, I need you right by my side)
You're, you're always on my mind (You'll, you'll always be on my mind)
And, and you are mine for life (Now let me tell you what I'm feeling, how it feels like)

Gd:
The minute that I met you was like 'Whoa'
And every thing about you was so beauti-damn-ful
You know I had to get the digits, yo yo
The 4-1-1, the things that you like, and don't like
Got a feeling you're the one I've been dreaming of
Got a feeling in my heart, and it's screaming 'Love'
It's you I live my life for, it's the one I adore
I'm gonna love you for life
And baby that's fosho
Feel me?

{Japanese Falsetto // Chorus:}
Miageta sorano hyoujou
Kimi wo omouto kagayakidashita
Mezamete sugu no kanjou takanaru kodou
Kimi ni muchuu sa
Afuredasu kono omoi wo ryoute ni sotto uketometanara
Aitai to negau kokoro kono te de motto todokete yukou

Gd:
I love you, I love you not
I love you, I love you not
I miss you, I need you
Come back to me
C'mon

And, and you are mine for life (Now let me tell you what I'm feeling, how it feels like)

Top:
Mind-blowing, girl you are oh so (Oh)
Dedicated to me, girl that's awesome (so awesome)
Everybody wanna know this all so (yea, c'mon)
So I'm about to hit 'em with a super-fly flow

Yo, yo, my baby got it goin' on for life (for life)
And she can never do wrong

Know what I mean?
