[Verse 1]
I had a feeling from the start of it
I had a joke on everyone
I had a joke who was in everyone
And if you listen up just once you know

[Chorus 1]
If you want you can never leave
And if you want, you can let her go

[Verse 2]
I had a feeling from the start of it
You could say so, motherfucker
You could say so, motherfucker
And then I took it all around
I took her back and I said to myself

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
All the negatives have been destroyed and I say
All the negatives have been destroyed, oh, yeah

[Verse 3]
I had a feeling from the start of it
You could let me go if you wanted to
But I haven't seen that you wanted to
So I took it all around I took it back
And I said to myself

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
