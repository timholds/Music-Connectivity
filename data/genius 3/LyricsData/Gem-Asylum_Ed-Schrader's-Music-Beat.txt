[Chorus:]
Gem asylum
Gem asylum
Meditate your eyes off me [x2]

[Verse 1:]
Straddling sarcophagus
Man is gardens [?]
It's my tricky gaze
Make your eyelids in separate places
All gathering at night
Immaculate garrisons conjure my zeppelin
We will get our kingdom divided

[Chorus:]
Gem asylum
Gem asylum
Meditate your eyes off me [x2]

[Verse 2:]
The Pharaoh sweeps into the city of glass
With a day glow fire
Eradicate rock, eradicate rock, eradicate rock, eradicate rock
Glass made of plastic
Your Pharaoh's fantastic
Glass made of plastic
Your Pharaoh's fantastic

[Chorus:]
Gem asylum
Gem asylum
Meditate your eyes off me [x2]
