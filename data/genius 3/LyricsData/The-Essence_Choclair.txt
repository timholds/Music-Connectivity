[Verse One]:
You see the essence was this
All about lyrics, beats that was the shit
Pull up on the block and cipher on the strip
Battle up some crews without causing no beef but but
But now the essence is this
All about whips, colors in the teeth
This and that chick
Guns on the street
And how much that you have under your mattress and your sheets, now
I don’t tell it like a hippie
Wanted hip hop to go back to what is really
But nah, not really
Don’t mind the evolution of music
But some people abuse it, it’s simply
Lyrics matter, beats and flow matter
Content, DJ's, B-Boys do matter
What what, do matter
What what, do matter
The same to yourself is the same up in your chatter

[Chorus]:
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop) music
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop) music
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop)
Yeah
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop) music

[Verse Two]:
I tell you this
You see the essence was, east Scarborough Boys & Girls Club
Or a red flame would come through and then the club
Or when King Turbo came through with murder dubs, and
Oh yes them baby doll dresses, them girls in them baby doll dresses
Grinding on the floor like nobody wanna test this
Get them on the wall then you grinding like you sexing
To them sound effects them
In my car I piled about 10 men
Don’t miss that time, but I miss my brethrens
Shit split ways, but I got love for them
Moms is good, the brothers are alright
Yo, my girls are good, you need to come check them
Mr. Chiz, I got your 6000
We leave the place surrounded and astounded
Yo, yo

[Chorus]:
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop) music
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop) music
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop)
Yeah
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop) music

[Verse Three]:
Never would you ever see another iller brother comin' past your way
Cause I step into your jam, and I sit down, atmosphere comin' this way
Because the essence is
Big raps bring them big biz
And big raps bring them big cribs
Then you get focused when you get kids
I know what hard work is
In a beautiful country that’s hard to work in
So I, got focused, put my work in
Then I, stayed focused, heart my own line
I tripped up and fell, but stumbled the skyline
I’m getting up, I’m hitting some great rhymes
I’m getting up from thin to yummy girls
Then I wanna get my shit around the world

[Chorus]:
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop) music
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop) music
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop)
Yeah
There ain’t nothing like (hip hop) music
