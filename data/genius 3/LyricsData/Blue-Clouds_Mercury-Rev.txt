Feeling your warm body next to mine
Feeling this feeling so fine
Feeling the wind blowing through your hair
Feeling the sun shining on your face

I'm a long time healing
I'm a long time healing

Knowing that I'm sure
Knowing there's a way
Knowing that I'm sure
Knowing there's a way

Watching your eyes watching me
Feeling my smile in your eyes
Walking beside you beside me
Juggling these feeling inside

I'm a long time healing
I'm a long time healing
I'm a long time healing
I'm a long time healing

Knowing that I'm sure
Knowing there's a way
Knowing that I'm sure
Knowing there's a way

Feeling the sky in the clouds
Knowing what I'm a round
Thinking things I never thought of
Feeling your warm body next to mine

I'm a long time healing
I'm a long time healing
I'm a long time healing
