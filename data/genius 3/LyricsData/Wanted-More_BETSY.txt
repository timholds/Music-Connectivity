[Verse 1]
You know baby that I wanted more than you could ever give to me
Like a bullet in the head, I fall
You could never leave me standing
It only takes one smile to build a thousand doubts
Only takes one slip to make a fall
You know baby that I wanted more than you could ever give to me

[Chorus]
You know I needed you more than you could ever give to me
You know I wanted it all, body and soul
With you lying right next to me

[Verse 2]
They say that time's a great healer
They say that love will never die
They say that lust will spin your world around and teach your soul to fly
You could beat me black and blue and I will follow you to the end of the earth and more
You could beat me black and blue and I will follow you to the end, to the end, to the end

[Chorus]
You know I needed you more than you could ever give to me
You know I wanted it all, body and soul
With you lying right next to me

[Bridge]
Don't leave my heart in scattered pieces
Don't you go tear me from a limb to limb
Don't go make pride the price that I'm gon' pay for you
Just leave your heart speak true
You gon' make my blood boil up, make my heart turn back
Make me melt like the ice come the day
'Cause you could beat me black and blue
And I will follow you to the end, to the end, to the end

[Chorus]
You know I needed you more than you could ever give to me
You know I wanted it all, body and soul
With you lying right next to me
You know I needed you more than you could ever give to me
You know I wanted it all, body and soul
With you lying right next to me

[Outro]
You know baby that I wanted more than you could ever give to me
