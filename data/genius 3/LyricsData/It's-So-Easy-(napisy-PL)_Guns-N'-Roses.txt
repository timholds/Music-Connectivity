[Verse 1]
I see your sister in
Her Sunday dress
She's out to please
She pouts her best
She's out to take
No need to try
She's ready to make

[Chorus]
It's so easy (easy)
When everybody's
Trying to please me baby
It's so easy, (easy)
When everybody's
Trying to please me

[Verse 2]
Cars are crashing
Every night
I drink and drive
Everything's in sight
I make the fire
But I miss the firefight
I hit the bullseye every night

[Chorus]
It's so easy (easy)
When everybody's
Trying to please me baby
Yeah it's so easy (easy)
When everybody's
Trying to please me

[Bridge]
It's so easy
But nothing seems
To please me
It all fits so right
When I fade
Into the night
See me hit you
You fall down
I see you standing there
You think you're so cool
Why don't you just
Fuck off

[Verse 3]
You get nothing for nothing
If that's what ya do
Turn around bitch
I got a use for you
Besides you ain't got
Nothing better to do
And I'm bored

[Chorus]
It's so easy (easy)
When everybody's
Trying to please me baby
Yeah it's so easy, easy
When everybody's
Trying to please me

It's so easy, but nothing seems to please me
It all fits so right
When I fade
Into the night
So come with me don't ask me where
Cuz I don't know
I try to please you
I ain't got no
Money but it goes to show

It's so easy.. So fucking easy...
It's so easy.. So fucking easy...
It's so easy.. So fucking easy..
It's so easy.. So fucking easy..
It's so easy.. hey so easy..
It's so easy.. So fucking easy..
It's so easy.. yeahhhhh
