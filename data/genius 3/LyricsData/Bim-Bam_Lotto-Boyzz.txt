[Verse 1: Ash]
We used to meet up at the bus stop and now me can't stop bus
Sipping on some coffee trynna make some starbucks
Baby borrow me your bum bum when I done come
We can buss a rum punch inna London


[Pre-Chorus]
Baby stop movin' mad
I love it when you let me move it
You bout to cause problems 'round here
Tell me you love it when you touch my jewellery girl

Have you still got time for me?
Cause Baby they be playing with your heart
Everybody wanna ruin your day

[Chorus]
Her biddy bing bum biddy di bum bum bam bay
Long time, me put it pon you
Her biddy bing bum biddy di bum bum bam bay
Big batty got me confused

Long time, me put it pon you

[Verse 2: Vianni]
Anglais to Francais
Merci beacoup, she say she want me (want me)
The guap make her work for papi
Get your eagle on, twist and twine for papi
You gotta work for me, you naughty girl you know you gotta twerk for me
I know you like to get it on with a nigga

You naughty girl, you the one for me
Bandit lover, call me poppa
When I'm around, I hit you up, my momma
Ring ring ring, make the telephone a bling
Make you sing, sing, sing

You said you like to get it on, with Vianni, like to get it on with me

[Pre Chorus]
Baby stop movin' mad

[Verse 3: Lucas]
Pulled up in something classy just to take you out to eat
Apple of my eye, but I'm staring at your peach
Shawty when you ride, looking like you want the D
Say you love my backstroke, make your body go weak
I'm that spot hitter, that guap flipper
She call your nigga big tipper
I get big figures, on my grind to be a rich nigga
I'm the shit nigga, time to put an end to a fucking bitch nigga
Shawty make that ass clap, make it round of applause
I'm naughty after hours, I'm a bullet for sure
Know that I'm peeking outdoors, when I'm inside deep in those walls, can't handle it all, but I'mma give you some more
All begging me to stop, why you longing it for
And make that back arch when you go on the fours
Kill her with the stroke, I be hitting every beat
But she got the maddest whine, make your body go weak

[Pre Chorus]
Baby stop movin' mad
I love it when you let me move it
You bout to cause problems 'round here
Tell me you love it when you touch my jewellery girl

Have you still got time for me?
Cause baby they be playing with your heart
Everybody wanna ruin your day

[Chorus: Ash & Vianni]
Her biddy bing bum biddy di bum bum bam bay
Long time, me put it pon you
Her biddy bing bum biddy di bum bum bam bay
Big batty got me confused
Her biddy bing bum biddy di bum bum bam bay
Long time, me put it pon you
Baby
I wanna see that thong, thong thong, thong, thong girl
