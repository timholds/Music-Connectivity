[Verse 1]
Even bad girls can do good things
Even bad girls have holy dreams
Oh I, I'm not so transparent
My intentions they ain't so apparent

Bad girls, bad girls, bad girls, bad girls

[Verse 2]
Even bad girls have tender hearts
Even bad girls can fall apart
In the night, oh I am transformed
By the next day I've been reborn

[Chorus]
If it were physical it would show
If it were spiritual I would know
If it were physical it would show
If it were spiritual I would know

There is a need always divided
From all things that I've been hiding

[Verse 3]
The truth you know I'll never find
I'll never have any peace of mind
It's true I know I'll never find
I'll never have any peace of mind

[Chorus]
If it were physical it would show
If it were spiritual I would know
If it were physical it would show
If it were spiritual I would know

[Bridge]
You know I love a good ceremony
That's why I chose matrimony
Oh I never want to feel ashamed
I just can't bear that kind of pain

There is a need, always divided, yeah
From all the things that I've been hiding, yeah
