[Verse: Kelly]
I wanna know
If I could get to know you
So many things, baby
I can't wait to show you
I don't know
If you feel the same as I do
Give me a sign, baby
Show me what to do

[Post-Chorus: Kelly]
(Can I be all you need?)
Can I be all you need?
(Can I be your everything?)
Your everything
(Baby, the time is now)
The time is now
(If you just show me how)
Baby, show me how

[Chorus:]
Show me the way to love you
Every night and every day
I'm thinkin' of you
All I need is just a chance
To love you
Show me the way, baby
Show me the way, the way

[Verse: Beyonce]
What would it take
For us to get together?
I wanna know
Would you stay with me forever?
Give me the chance
I know I can make you love me
Just say the word, baby
Let me make you see

[Post-Chorus: Beyonce]
(Can I be all you need?)
Can I be your everything?
(Baby, the time is now)
The time is now
(If you just show me how)
If you just show me how

[Chorus:]
Show me the way to love you
Every night and every day
I'm thinkin' of you
All I need is just a chance
To love you
Show me the way, baby
Show me the way, the way

[Bridge:]
Show me the way
What would it take
For me to love you
Every night every day
I want you to know
I'm thinkin' of you

[Chorus:]
Show me the way to love you
Every night and every day
I'm thinkin' of you
All I need is just a chance
To love you
Show me the way, baby
Show me the way, the way
