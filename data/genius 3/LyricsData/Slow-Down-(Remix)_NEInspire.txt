[Intro: Various Artists]
Mackin
Say somethin'
Compound
Can you grasp it?
Are ya ready?
Yeah Ryazz
Ryazz let's do it
Let's go NEInspire
Haha, y'know, when you've been kicked the fuck down
Time and success is revenge, let's do it
Welcome to the show, is everyone ready? Let's go

[Hook: The Team]x2
I tell em
Slow down, you know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down

[Verse 1: Mackin]
I started so low and now I'm so high
I'm so high I feel like I'm a star up in the sky
Sometimes I laugh, sometimes I cry
Always try, I don't lie, I'm never saying goodbye
People always said, "you'll never make it"
So I got with Compound and now we hit the stages
I'm not gonna lie, I've seen so many faces
Been around the world, seen so many places
Welcome to our show, I'm Mackin, just say something
Speachless!
So talented, produce, write, rap and sing
Who remembers these two, first bid, fake blame
I like you girl, here's my number, just ring
I love my team, this for them now have a drink
I can't remember, I'm drunk I think
I must be cause I'm going so slow (slow, slow)

[Hook: The Team]x2
I tell em
Slow down, you know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down

[Verse 2: Compound]
I've moved too fast, my style can't be unsurpassed
I'm where I need to be, finally at fucking last
Try to understand me and forget about my past
Girl, timing was the only reason that you weren't the one
Just slow down, you know you can't touch me
It's those who care too much that do get hurt
Hoes tryna flirt but you're heading for divert
Let me check my watch again, oh it's that time
Snapback, hoody on, welcome to the show
Ladies and gentleman we're here to rock the show
Yeah, whoa you don't like me? Fuck your feelings
Whoa my team got the dealings, let's go
For me, my crew, my hometown the story just began
Remember one thing when you fucking stopping at this
I'm right behind you till I take you from the spot
Ambitious motherfucker, I only need one shot

[Hook: The Team]x2
I tell em
Slow down, you know you can't catch me
I move too fast on the gas, don't chase me
Slow down, slow down
