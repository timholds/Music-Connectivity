[Verse 1]
You're no rock n' roll fun
Like a party that's over
Before it's begun

You're no walk in the park
More like a shot in the dark
With clues left for no one

[Hook]
All the boys in the band
Know how to get down
Fill our Christmas socks
With whiskey drinks and chocolate bars

When the evening ends
We won't be thinking of you then
Although the best man
Won't hang out with the girl band
The girl band

[Verse 2]
You're no rock n' roll fun
Like a piece of art
That no one can touch

Your head's always up in the clouds
Writing your songs
Won't you ever come down?

[Hook]
All the boys in the band
Know how to get down
Fill our Christmas socks
With whiskey drinks and chocolate bars

When the evening ends
We won't be thinking of you then
Even if your song
Is playing on the jukebox
The jukebox

[Bridge]
You wanna party with the lights on
Come on, I like the dark!
You always wanna hear the same old song
Come on, play another song!

[Verse 1]
'Cause you're no rock n' roll fun
Like a party that's over
Before it's begun

You're no walk in the park
More like a shot in the dark
With clues left for no one

[Outro]
You're no rock n' roll fun
You're no rock n' roll fun
You're no rock n' roll fun
You're no rock n' roll fun
