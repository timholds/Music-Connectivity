Some called him Kas, some called him Kevin
No matter what you called him you know that he in heaven
Harlem nigga, yea I met him up in Branson
He fuck with the shaking, I ain't talkin' bout dancing
Hustler, he did what he had to
A good father, yea he did what a dad do
And we would talk about taking over the galaxy
Back in Jers when I lived up in the galaxy
I ain't grow up with er
But I felt like I grew up with er
Great tied up on the do up with er
That MU sign, I do up with er
Got drunk, got screwed up with er, my nigga yo

For God to love the world He gave His one and only
Forgotten son, I wish I believe in Him
To not parish, but have forever lasting life
And you will never be alone

For God to love the world He gave His one and only
Forgotten son, I wish I believe in Him
To not parish, but have forever lasting life
And you will never be alone

What up nigga? What you doin' there?
If it's chicks there you probably screwing there
Aura phase shit change, you still the same
I'm still getting high, getting drugged and getting brain
And still having fun whenever possible
I'm mad that I ain't make it to the hospital
But when you called then you said it wasn't logical
You still stand strong in your last days
You still smoke hays on your last days
You ain't give a fuck, you a rider nigga
He took my wetted on steroids and higher nigga
Love Kev Kas, never a liar nigga

For God to love the world He gave His one and only
Forgotten son, I wish I believe in Him
To not parish, but have forever lasting life
And you will never be alone

For God to love the world He gave His one and only
Forgotten son, I wish I believe in Him
To not parish, but have forever lasting life
And you will never be alone

I remember when he first told me he had cancer
I looked into his eyes, I was surprised
He was the strongest nigga that I knew
Heart broke, he told me God had his back, I don't need to worry
I should stay on tour, I don't need to hurry
I will pack up, stay home, nigga get some rest
You know Kas, he into getting hoes and getting fresh
Real nigga, always stand on his two feet
Showed me love like brothers, it was too deep
I weeped at his funeral, I cried a lot
And got high in the church, in the parking lot
My nigga left earth, so we spark a lot

For God to love the world He gave His one and only
Forgotten son, I wish I believe in Him
To not parish, but have forever lasting life
And you will never be alone

For God to love the world He gave His one and only
Forgotten son, I wish I believe in Him
To not parish, but have forever lasting life
And you will never be alone

You will never be alone
