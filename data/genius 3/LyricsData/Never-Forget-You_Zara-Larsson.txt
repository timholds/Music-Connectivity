[Verse 1: Zara Larsson]
I used to be so happy, but without you here I feel so low
I watched you as you left, but I can never seem to let you go

[Pre-Chorus 1: Zara Larsson]
‘Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
It's buried deep inside me, but I feel there's somethin' you should know

[Chorus: Zara Larsson]
I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side
'Til the day I die

[Post-Chorus: Zara Larsson]
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die
'Til the day I die

[Verse 2: MNEK]
Funny how we both end up here, but everything seems so right
I wonder what would happen if we went back and put up a fight

[Pre-Chorus 2: MNEK]
‘Cause once upon a time you were my everything
It's clear to see that time hasn't changed a thing
So, what in this world do you think could ever take you off my mind?

[Chorus: Zara Larsson & MNEK]
I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side
'Til the day I die

[Bridge: Zara Larsson & MNEK]
Feelin' it, lovin' it, everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had somethin' special with you
But, sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
But I'm still tied and I can't hide my connection with you
Feelin' it, lovin' it, everything that we do
And all along, I knew I had something special with you
But, sometimes you just gotta know that these things fall through
I can't hide my connection with you

[Chorus: Zara Larsson & MNEK]
I will never forget you
You will always be by my side
From the day that I met you
I knew that I would love you 'til the day I die
And I will never want much more
And in my heart, I will always be sure
I will never forget you
And you will always be by my side
'Til the day I die

[Outro: Zara Larsson & MNEK]
'Til the day I die, 'til the day I die, 'til the day I die
'Til the day I die, 'til the day I die, 'til the day I die
And you will always be by my side
I will never forget you
I will never, never, never, never
Never, never, never, never
I will never forget you 'til the day I die
