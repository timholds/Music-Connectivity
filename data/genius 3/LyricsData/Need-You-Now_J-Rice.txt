Picture perfect memories scattered all around the floor
Reaching for the phone cos i can't fight it anymore
And i wonder if i ever cross your mind
To me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after the 1 i'm all alone and i need you now
I said i wouldn't call but i lost all control and i need you now
And i don't know how i can be without, i just need you now

Another shot of whisky can't stop looking at the door
Wishing you come sweep in, in the way you did before
When i wonder if i ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time

It's a quarter after the 1 i'm a little drunk and i need you now
I said i wouldn't call but i lost all control and i need you now
And i don't know how i could do without, i just need you now

Yes i'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all

It's a quarter after the 1 i'm all alone and i need you now
I said i wouldn't call i'm a little drunk and i need you now
And i don't know how i can do without, i just need you
I just need you now
