If by chance we meet again
If by chance we meet again

I wanna see you
Yes, I do

If by chance we meet again
I'll be sure to say I love you
If by chance I see your face
I'll be dazzled by the magic in your eyes

They look so sweet, yes, they do
If by chance we should happen to meet
I'll run into your arms so safe and warm
By your side I'll stand if by chance we meet again

If by chance we meet again
(If by chance we meet again)
If by chance we meet again
If by chance we meet again

Oh and if by chance I talk to you
I wonder if the words would come out right
If by chance I held you close
I could drift away with the warmth of your embrace

You were so sweet
If by chance we should happen to meet
We'll start all over, over again, me and my best friend
A whole new life we'll plan if by chance we shall meet again

If by chance we meet again
(We'll meet again)
If by chance we meet again

Sometimes I wonder why you had to go and leave me here
Standing in the cold and all alone
As the tears begin to fall I will remain standing tall
And the memories I will cherish forever more

If by chance we meet again
(If by chance this is our last time
I see you on the other side, yes)

If by chance we meet again
(And if by chance I have to cry)
If by chance, if by chance
(I'm telling you babe, I'm telling you baby)

If by chance we meet again
(It's because I know its time for us to say goodbye)
If by chance we meet again
(I know it's, I know it's time, I know it's time)

I'm running, said I'm running yes, I am
I'm running to say goodbye
