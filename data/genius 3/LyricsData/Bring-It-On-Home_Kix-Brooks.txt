[Verse 1]
I was looking for a slow down
When you came around
I just didn't know how
I never left a bar room or a beer joint
Till the lights went out
But in the middle of a long slow kiss
The light came on
I been doing this all wrong
I think I'm a try holding on

[Chorus]
And all my life I been running
And all these nights I've wasted
All this time I been on the move
I think I'ma stop now and
Bring it on home with you

[Verse 2]
This is where I use to make my move
Slip on my boots
Now I'm good staying here
Just laying here, tangled up in you
I just never found that one I couldn't resist
Ah I could get use to this
I think I'm going to need one more kiss

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
By my side not gonna let love pass me by
Whoa not this time.. come on

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Gonna bring it on home
Gonna shake it all out
Just me and you in this big old house
Gonna have a time
Gonna find a place in the sun now baby
Gonna bring it on home
Gonna lay it on down
Gonna feel the way that I'm feelin' now forever baby
Yeah
Gonna bring it on home with you
