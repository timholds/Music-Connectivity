Pavement chaser til i came upon a "welcome"/
Not too much to claim from 2 years, and 4 solo albums/
I lost my girl, i lost my money, lost my frame of ref/
In to this aimless place between no pace and no more patience left/
Mom told me take a breathe, father told me not to/
When he found my bag of pot in that box while looking for lost shoes/
Guap rules everything around me/
Cream get the money, puff a onie on streets of dakota county/
My buddies gon hold me down if i ever decide to grace the stage/
But thats cuz they think we're all together up in this paper chase/
When i've been broke for days, and kinda like the living/
Plus this christian guilt has got me in a trance of only giving/
So, i toss a bum a buck, and hope its not in vain/
Cuz my selflessness is really only selfishly the same/
Tho i,, kinda admire the style of diamond attire/
Acquire similar shine from seeing what others aspire, occur/
Higher than high needs a word, i know their dying of thirst/
While looking for zion on earth, and we coming live from the burbs/
Where living life is a blurr when tripping off myrrh/
See, this knowledge is power and bitch im out for the world, so hold on/

You heard it live from the entourage pilot watching entourage pilots/
Thinking of names for the movement, you shoulda seen how his eyes lit/
Irises wide as vaginas of diamond kitty, this city, is mine/
And everyone in it is coming with me, tonight, cuz this the kidnapping/
Of the kid's napping on this kid's rapping/
Said that it would come, spoiler alert, i made the shit happen./
No sir, you heard aurora borealis, so you know/
The constant damage of the kid thats steady canvasing with some/
Casual canabis, cancer stricken my family is/
Can't dismiss it through manuscript, but i hope that this balances, out/
All of the clout and the doubt in a higher power/
The world is mine, or its yours, or its ours, depending how ya, wanna make it/
Way i see it you can live it two hands/
The egocentric, or the knowledge your part of a larger plan/
In my fran tarkenton jersey, yelling mercy/
With that michael weston swag, coming after those that burned me/
You ever wonder where your life'll be at 30?/
Me, i wonder if ill make it to that age, but im not worried/
I just pray that either way i do my best to please the heavens/
So my entrance won't be tainted, but be looked at as a blessing, hold on, heaven
