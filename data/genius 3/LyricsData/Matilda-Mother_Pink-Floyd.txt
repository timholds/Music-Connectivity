[Verse 1]
There was a king who ruled the land
His Majesty was in command
With silver eyes the scarlet eagle
Showered silver on the people...

[Hook]
Oh Mother, tell me more

[Bridge]
Why’d'ya have to leave me there
Hanging in my infant air
Waiting?
You only have to read the lines
They’re scribbly black and everything shines

[Verse 2]
Across the stream with wooden shoes
With bells to tell the king the news
A thousand misty riders climb up
Higher once upon a time
Wandering and dreaming
The words have different meaning
Yes they did

[Musical interlude]

[Verse 3]
For all the time spent in that room
The doll’s house, darkness, old perfume
And fairy stories held me high
On clouds of sunlight floating by

[Hook]
Oh Mother, tell me more
Tell me more

[Outro]
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
Aaaaaaaah
