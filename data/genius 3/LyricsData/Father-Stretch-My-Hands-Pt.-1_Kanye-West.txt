You're the only power (power)
You're the only power that can
You're the only power (power)
You're the only power that can
Ooooooo, ooooooo, oooooo

If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I
I just wanna feel liberated, I, I, I
If I ever instigated, I am sorry
Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, I

[Verse: Kanye West]
Now if I fuck this model
And she just bleached her asshole
And I get bleach on my T-shirt
I'ma feel like an asshole
I was high when I met her
We was down in Tribeca
She get under your skin if you let her
She get under your skin if you-uh
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna talk about it
I don't even wanna say nothin'
Everybody gon' say somethin'
I'd be worried if they said nothin'
Remind me where I know you from?
She looking like she owe you some
You know just what we want
I wanna wake up with you in my
Beautiful morning

[Pre-Chorus: Kid Cudi]
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted
Beautiful morning, you're the sun in my morning babe
Nothing unwanted

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
If I ever instigated I am sorry
Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, I
