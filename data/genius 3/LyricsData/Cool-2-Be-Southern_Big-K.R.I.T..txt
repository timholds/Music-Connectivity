[Intro]
We make it cool to be southern

[Verse 1]
Okay I'm straight up off my grandmama porch
Hollywood neva, I took the southernized approach
Collard green pockets but I southern fried the flow
Candied yam drop with some cornbread to throw
Mason jar drank shit, keep the dank lit
We swang whips old schools like my paw-paw
You can't get
Now which motherfuckers said that we can't pimp?
I hit ditches like switches, before the paint flip
I can't be faded
The heart of king born in the 1980's
For real, you never see a nigga like me lately
Debonair, never scared, Fred Astaire when I carry a cadence
Refrain for being lame, ho
I got a surefire way to give the game what it came for
A third coast nigga still bustin, stop frontin' motherfucker

[Hook]
We make it cool to be southern
I'm talking about the dirty south, folks with the grills in mouth
We make it cool to be southern
Everybody wanna ball nowadays, but don't nobody wanna get paid
We make it cool to be southern
Get down if you wanna, crackin' seals, blowin' some mari-j-uana
We make it cool to be southern
Return of 4eva all day, them country people feel what I say
We make it cool to be southern

[Verse 2]
Let me take you down this country road
Country flow, country foe, country fire
24's on the Caddy, type savvy
My player ways never fade, I got 'em from my grand daddy
Old school, so smooth
The type of fresh that you can comb through
Or you can cut it with a butter knife
And spread it on the brain of a dame for some change
But that's only if you cut it right
Off top my drop, rims chop, no cops, drink pop
Lord knows I ain't seen it with my
Green lit, grain grip, bad bitch on my tip
And when she tell me, lord knows she don't mean it
I been this way since I was knee high
To a grasshopper gettin' money in my Levis
I mean my genes, Pine-Sol clean
Bird's eye view with my frame on lean

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Get down, get down, get down with it
I'm talking about the dirty south, folks with the grills in mouth
I make it cool to be southern
Return to 4eva all day, them country people feel what I say

[Hook]
