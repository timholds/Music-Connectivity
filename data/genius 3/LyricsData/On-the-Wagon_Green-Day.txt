Sometimes it gets real hard
And I need some kind of output
For input twice the size of my one inch mind
So slap me on the hand
Put it right back down my pants
Turn me right around
Kick me in the ass

[Chorus] x2
Well, today I say sweet things
But tomorrow I'll be making up excuses
For my actions â€˜cause it's been so long
Since I have been in love
A special kind of feeling
Guess my best excuse
I'm on the wagon again

Well, I got no real excuse
I'm on the wagon again
