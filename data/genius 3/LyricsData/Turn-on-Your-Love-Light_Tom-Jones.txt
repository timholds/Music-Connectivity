[Chorus]
Without a warning you broke my heart
Taken it, baby, tore it apart
And you left me standing in the dark cryin'
Said your love for me was dyin'
So come on, baby, baby, please
I'm begging you, baby; I'm on my knees
Turn on your light; let it shine on me
Turn on your love light; let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it

Well, I get a little lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you, darling, to make things all right
So come on, baby, baby, please
And I'm begging you, baby, 'cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your light; let it shine on me
Turn on your love light; let it shine on me
Let it shine, let it shine, let it

[Chorus]
Well, I get a little lonely in the middle of the night
And I need you, baby, to make things all right
So come on, baby, baby, please
And I'm begging you, baby, 'cause I'm on my knees
Turn on your light; let it shine on me
Turn on your love light; let it shine on me

Let it shine on me, let it shine on me
Let it shine on me, let it shine on me
Why don't you let it shine on me?
Why don't you let it, baby, shine on me?
Early in the morning let it shine on me
Late in the evening let it shine on me too
Well, that's all I need; I just got to get some
That's all I need; I just got to get some
I just got to, I just got to
Get a little more; yes, I do
And I don't want it all--I just want a little bit
I don't want it all, no, no, no, no--I just want a little bit
A little of your lovin', a little of your kissin'
A little of your rollin'--that's all I want
Baby, please, baby, please
Baby, please, baby, please
Just like a stingray on a four-day ride
Now, wait a minute: I wanna tell you about my baby
I wanna tell you how come she make me feel so good
Yes, she do; yes, she do
I know she make me feel all right; yes, she do

She's got box-back nitties
And great big noble thighs
Working undercover with a boar hog's eye
Take your hands out of your pockets and turn on your love light
