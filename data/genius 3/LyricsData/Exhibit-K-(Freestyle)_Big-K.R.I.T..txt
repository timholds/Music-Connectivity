[Intro]
Jealousy's a motherfucker
You weak jealous motherfuckers
If you a jealous motherfucker you just a weak motherfucker, ha
KRIT wuz here
Sorry we took so long
I wish I had a real excuse
But you motherfuckers just gotta be patient
Krizzle

[Big KRIT]
Do you mind if I murder this?
Spit that southern slang over something so conservative
Swinging lane to lane, candy coated sippin' purple shit
Mind frame; I herbal it, southern MC of my caliber never heard of it
Verbally, spit that gospel proper in word of it
No obstacle can topple my run, simply hurdle it
Down to send shells over green this ain't turtle shit
Bolt like Usain not got game to get got
I mastered the Shaolin styles of BIG and 2Pac
Sweet and sour chicken while my partner working two woks
Trying to get that candy paint that's wetter than a dew drop
Down to take a loss like give me whatever you got
Scraping from the game, I'll be a king, just you watch
Sippin' fine wine with breadsticks and goulash
I'm far far away from sardines and noodles
You'd ball hard too if all your life you lived frugal
Wishing on a star for J's but got Pumas
That was passed down to you cause your brother outgrew 'em
I'm a get 'em, I'm a get 'em
Either ride for the cause or stay in and die with 'em
I figured you convert for what it's worth, I'm on my grind
If you ain't living for the day it's safe to say you wasting time
If you ain't down to elevate your mind, then bitch you wasting rhymes
Tarnished teachings never reach the pinnacle to shine
Discovery of Krizzle like the invention of flying
Intertwined with the holy grail and unearthing of Zion
You cartoon Simbas ain't fucking with this line
Ice box hard with a vessel made of iron
Thanks to the all spark I'm Optimus Prime
With the skill to battle rap death in the event that I'm dying
Do away with any doubts that might have kept you from buying
My product's so awaited like Doomsday to the Mayans
I'm fire, I'm back you ain't know who you was trying
I'm fire, I'm back you ain't know who you was trying
See KRIT ain't just a name it's an acronym
King Remembered in Time but none come after him
Hanging from the scaffold and reaching to the youth
About life and how to capture it
The shit I spit is baffling, off the chain but accurate
Forever real, freshly sealed, every time I package it
Switching up the flow so I could spazz a bit
You know you ain't fucking with me shawty kill the track and give it back
Cuz If I break it then I bought it, Mississippi to the core
Muddy water, Dixie rebel, cotton picking
I was doing if you talking Polo sweaters
Granny on the porch while she showing me the ropes
Never be ashamed of what you from and what you know
Cause no dues have been paid and for years they watch the flow
So look dead in the eyes when you talk to white folks
A product of environment is probably why I never win
My grandma passed and obviously I ain't been the same since
This ain't rap this experience
Birth of hip hop's very innocent
Light a candle something so intimate
God said keep going I was meant for this
Don't let the sound fool you my flow is too limitless
Boobie Miles on my journey
I'm killing motherfuckers all the while I'm still learning
Ancient secrets form my technique, a truth seeker alike
I gave a fuck if you respect me, I hail where the best be
No words for my enemies, yeah I pray for 'em but I rarely have the energy
Dodging weapons of man till God find a sin for me
My poetry more music than a singer with a symphony
It only makes sense they'd overlook me in this industry
But I heard they got wind of me
Krizzle

[Outro]
Yeah
God Bless the Dead, hahahahahahaha
What?
Ya'll acting like you never been to a funeral before
Hahahahahahahah
This Krizzle
