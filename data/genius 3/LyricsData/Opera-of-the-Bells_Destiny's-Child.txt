Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to say, "Throw cares away"
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold

Ding-dong, ding-dong, that is their song
With joyful ring, all caroling
One seems to hear, words of good cheer
From everywhere, filling the air

Oh how they pound raising the sounds
Or here and dale filling the air

Gaily they ring, while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
Merry merry merry merry Christmas
On and on they sing, on without end
Their joyful tone to every home
Ding-dong ding-dong, ding-dong ding-dong
Ding-dong ding-dong, ding-dong ding-dong
Diiiiiiiiiiiing (ding ding ding), doooooooooong (ding ding ding)
Diiiiiiiiiiiing (ding ding ding), doooooooooong (ding ding ding)
Diiiiiiiiiiiing (ding ding ding), doooooooooong (ding ding ding)
Diiiiiiiiiiiing (ding ding ding), doooooooooong (ding ding ding)
Ding, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-ding, ding, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-ding
Ding, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-ding, ding, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-ding
Ding, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-ding, ding, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-ding
Ding, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-ding, ding, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-ding
Ding, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-ding, ding, di-di-di-di-di-di-di-ding

Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells
All seem to say, "Throw cares away"
Christmas is here, bringing good cheer
To young and old, meek and the bold

Ding-dong, ding-dong, that is their song
With joyful ring, all caroling
One seems to hear, words of good cheer
From everywhere, filling the air

(Oh how happy are their tones)

Gaily they ring, while people sing
Songs of good cheer, Christmas is here
On and on they sing, on without end
Their joyful tone to every home
To every home (ooh, ooh), to every home (ooh, oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh)
To every home (ooh, ooh), to every home (ooh, oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh)
