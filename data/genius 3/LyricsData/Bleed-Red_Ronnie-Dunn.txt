[Verse 1]
Let’s say we’re sorry, ’fore it’s too late
Give forgiveness a chance
Turn the anger into water
Let it slip through our hands

[Chorus]
We all bleed red, we all taste rain
All fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret
We all cry tears, we all bleed red

[Verse 2]
If we’re fighting, we’re both losing
We’re just wasting our time
Because my scars, they are your scars
And your world is mine

[Chorus]
You and I, we all bleed red, we all taste rain
All fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret
We all cry tears, we all bleed red

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes we’re strong, sometimes we’re weak
Sometimes we’re hurt, and it cuts deep
We live this life, breath to breath
We’re all the same, we all bleed red

[Bridge]
Let’s say we’re sorry
’Fore it’s too late

[Chorus]
We all bleed red, all taste rain
All fall down, lose our way
We all say words, we regret
We all cry tears, we all bleed red

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes we’re strong, sometimes we’re weak
Sometimes we’re hurt, it cuts deep
We live this life, breath to breath
We’re all the same, we all bleed red
