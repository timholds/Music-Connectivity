I smoked everything out I did it just like you said
But when that smoke was clear you know they were still here
All wrapped up in blue jeans oh yeah its just like you said
With their mercenary smiles they ain't done yet
Can you say well never mind, oh
Lucille, how long Lucille
They want us in rows
But for how long Lucille
Love they'll follow us home, it's just like you said
But I will speak no more, I'll speak no more to them
Friends of Narcissus oh, they are all friends of Judas
And when my voice has matured they won't hear a thing
Can you say well never mind, oh
Lucille, how long Lucille
They want us in rows
But for how long Lucille
Lucille, how long Lucille
They want us in rows
But for how long Lucille
I've heard in recent times
And I was praying that it was a lie
The clergy have been telling me
You've been doing more than just undressing
I know that it can't be right
There's a hundred people in the service line
I've seen in recent years
Bruises on you that I can't heal
