[Intro X2: Movie Sample]
Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude
Except as a punishment for crime
Be where of the party shall have been duely convicted
Shall exist within the United States

[Frukwan]
Here in the Chamber, Zig Zag Zig
Near in result, to of a life bid
Exercise power, train of thought
Rap game started, the shores of the north
Divide and conquer, lifetime span
Keeping it real, Asiatic Black man
Spread the word, then we got heard
Time ain't served, and niggas wanna splurge
Up Jumped the Boogie, ready to creep
Flood the street, Gravediggaz cracked the concrete
First had home, lost control
Shuffle 32, some lost their soul
Pit full of Snakes, ice and Trey-8's
Niggas is dead weight, they move like Snakes
Tried looking beyond, niggas ain't strong
Divide yourself, and settle for wealth
Half-half, the choke, why? Niggas was broke
Back then was about fly sneak's and coats
Added to contempt, niggas made sense
Now they is all fucked up and bent
Took it for granted, covering the planet
And niggas scratch their head and don't understand it

[Movie Sample]
Some man could bend them with two beams of light

[Poetic]
A'yo, kick off your shoes and relax your feet
Cats I know carry a gat and their grief
Just so they don't be attacking the streets
At the Gravedigga show, nigga, unstrap your piece
The thugs with the Moet and Alizay mix
It's the thug passion, holiday blitz
And this is the place to be, that made me
Know how to Shiek, what makes the babies
You find silver when a women dressed to the max
You even make a villain just wanna lay back
Some fall in love with the super thugs
And still, do for love, what fiends do for drugs
My fathers know, will you make all of the dough?
Snakes fall, where-ever you be they wanna go, so
If my niggas just hold me down
The dance floor turns into holy ground
The black Cali fad piece like Mount Evere'
War technician just like Yasser Arafat
Fat strike, every almanac, beyond what you call a map
I'm a hall matt, makin enemies fall back
Your platoon will be stranded like a black lagoon
While I'm stikin my flag in the moon
You're consumed by the envy, the lust and the jealousy
If you were as well as me, drownin in Hennessey

[Hook: Poetic]
From the womb to the tomb, sperm to the urn
Citizens in the Hell, trying not to get burned
Gravediggaz at it again, we return
Killin mad germs, killin bad sperm
..womb to the tomb, sperm to the urn
Citizens in the Hell, trying not to get burned
Gravediggaz at it again, we return
Killin mad germs, killin bad sperm
