[Verse 1]
You're looking just a little too hard at me
Standing just a little too close to me
You're saying not quite enough to me
You're sipping just a little too slow for me
No doubt you play it real cool, homie
Got me thinking what is it you do for me
Tripping a little more than I should be
So let yourself go and get right with me

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right tonight
(We can get right)

[Verse 2]
Your lips talking 'bout I "play too much"
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants?
My hips moving oh so slow
Bar tab, looking like a car note
All I need is you here right by my side
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line

[Chorus]
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right tonight
(We can get right)

[Bridge]
So much we have got to say, but so little time
And if tonight isn't long enough, don't leave love behind
(Don't leave this love behind)
Baby, take my hand, I will show you why

[Chorus] (3x)
I'm about to sign you up, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right
(We can get right)
I'm about to fill your cup, we can get right
Before the night is up, we can get right tonight
Before the night is up, we can get right, get right tonight
(We can get right)
