[Verse 1]
I can’t go on, I can’t go on
Gotta keep it together
But don’t get me wrong, don’t get me wrong
Cause baby, you make me better, hey
With just one look you make me shiver
I just wanna take you home
Wanna go, yeah I wanna go
Now girl, you make me a believer
I wanna take off all my clothes
Wanna go, you make me wanna go

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can’t go on no more
When you look this freaking beautiful
Oh hands down to the floor, my love
And I’m doing whatever you want

[Chorus]
I can’t go on, I can’t go on
When you look this freaking beautiful
I can’t go on, I can’t go on
When you look this freaking beautiful, woah

[Verse 2]
You’ve got me good, you’ve got me good
And I’m not going nowhere
Right in your hook, that’s understood
But I’ma take you to somewhere

[Pre-Chorus]
I just can’t go on no more
When you look this freaking beautiful
Oh hands down to the floor, my love
And I’m doing whatever you want

[Chorus]
I can’t go on, I can’t go on
When you look this freaking beautiful
I can’t go on, I can’t go on
When you look this freaking beautiful

[Bridge]
So freaking beautiful
Baby, I just can’t go on

[Chorus]
I can’t go on (I can’t go on)
I can’t go on (I can’t go on)
When you look this freaking beautiful
I can’t go on (I can’t go on)
I can’t go on (I can’t go on)
When you look this freaking beautiful

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
So freaking beautiful
Baby, I just can’t go on
