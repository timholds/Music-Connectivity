In life, there's people that hustle
In life, there's people that grind
And there's We The Best music who make History

History is something that cannot be forgotten
I've been through everyone black, I have seen an overcome in the evilest hate ever that man can as ever wicknesses
They told me "no", and I told 'em "yes"

I have helped so many, and some have fogotten
I have been challenged, and I always win
I have been to wars, and came out with no scares
I have been tested, and I always passed

This sound contains my pain, my blessings, the stars on this album is my voice
The drums on this album is my heart beating
People feel victory is just a win, Victory is a strouble, a journey of life
Victory is accomplishment, Victory is a survival

When you're on the way to tap, they cheer for you
When you reach the top on the noun, they want you to die

I speak to my music, I'm so hood, we takin' over, I'm out here grindin', I go hard, I am the street
You can't stop what is destined to win
When they say Khaled, they say Warrior, Loyal, the chosen one
It's so as the way that caused you that don't wanna see your grind

I tell 'em watch me now and learn
I stil find a way to forgive
The more I hate, the more I love
Only Allah can judge me

Welcome to my Victory
