[Intro]
Yo
Know who it is
Merky ACE
Gaza master
Inside
Dun know
Hold tight [?] inside
Who said man can't do tunes with choruses and still call it grime?

[Chorus]
If I draw my ting out here
I'll turn this place into Gaza
Hold it down, blud, I'm the master
Before your body drops just like pastor
No, you won't need a plaster
Get clapped in your dome, no getting up after
Boom, aim for the head like master
Clap, leave your son with no father

[Verse 1]
I'll bun out your chest like Wray & Nephew
Duppy your sister and your two nephews
Man wanna come here hyping to me?
Telling you, rudeboy, that's quite stressful
Squeeze off eight and turn a man stencil
Full up with lead like a school kid's pencil
Onto the war like a settee
But I move Shinobi like Tenshin
Sometimes, I keep it moving like DJs
Pull up the beat and reload while T sprays
Couldn't really give two shits what he says
That's the bottom line like Stone Cold Steve says
Normal, that's the sound of a deep brain
Normal, that's the sound of the street ways
Step inna my path, get skied, you'll see space
Put tears on your mum's eyes like C8

[Chorus]
If I draw my ting out here
I'll turn this place into Gaza
Hold it down, blud, I'm the master
Before your body drops just like pastor
No, you won't need a plaster
Get clapped in your dome, no getting up after
Boom, aim for the head like master
Clap, leave your son with no father

[Verse 2]
And I do this easy
Merky's young but not like Jeezy
Merky's little but not like Weezy
I'm the little shit that's bricking up TTs
Banging everyone but not like TT
While I was out there grinding
You man were watching toys and E.T
Busting moonwalks to the Jackson CD
Brought your long ting like Logan and cheeky
Snatch a man's chain, I'm sneaky, can't see me
Zephron, the hardest level, can't beat me
Man ah shank-shank like the boys from E3, but
My sector is Blue
SE13, to the ends, I'm true
Out there everyday, don't see you
When I do, gonna dump like I don't love you

[Chorus]
If I draw my ting out here
I'll turn this place into Gaza
Hold it down, blud, I'm the master
Before your body drops just like pastor
No, you won't need a plaster
Get clapped in your dome, no getting up after
Boom, aim for the head like master
Clap, leave your son with no father

[Verse 3]
I'll laugh in the face of bad luck
Walk on three drains, say fuck bad luck
Ain't got bad luck, can't reach good luck
As the shells eat your face and shout out bad luck
Call me the dentist, I've got the teeth tucked
In school, I had to gas all the shanks up
Man ain't police but I wanna see your hands up
And if I see hands down
I'll tear through your crown, take man's bounty
Make man spin around like James Brown
Get down, get down, but I ain't OGz
Two gun buck give you black eyes just like P's
My boy shot birds, no, he didn't shoot trees
If you ever saw what the skeng done to the B
Definitely wouldn't be looking at me
Like say Merky ACE was Stevie

[Chorus]
If I draw my ting out here
I'll turn this place into Gaza
Hold it down, blud, I'm the master
Before your body drops just like pastor
No, you won't need a plaster
Get clapped in your dome, no getting up after
Boom, aim for the head like master
Clap, leave your son with no father

[Chorus]
If I draw my ting out here
I'll turn this place into Gaza
Hold it down, blud, I'm the master
Before your body drops just like pastor
No, you won't need a plaster
Get clapped in your dome, no getting up after
Boom, aim for the head like master
Clap, leave your son with no father
