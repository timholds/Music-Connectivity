You're so beautiful
And i don't want to
Destroy you
With my desire
I want to see you through
Train of feeling
Breaks down
Into a quagmire
Signal lights have turned red
We'll be here for a long long time
Don't want to run you into wreckage
Into decay beyond gauge
Tell your arms to go the right way
And avoid the pillage
You're so dutiful
And i do want to
Look after you
Like you do me
But we're too far apart
For it to be true
And i don't want to run you into wreckage
Into decay beyond gauge
Tell your arms to go the right way
And avoid...
