[Verse]
You got to feel it yes you got to feel it
To get it right even one time
You got to feel it don't take notes
Just clear out your mind
Let go your pride
Feel it inside
It's a it's a it's a
You got to feel it or I suspect
You'll wind up where you don't want to get
It's a long way home when you're trying to find your way
With a bag full of books
The notes that you took
A compass and stick
And the sevenths and the sixths
It's a it's a yes sir

[Outro]
To feel it
To feel it yeah
You got to feel it
Oh you got to feel it yeah[x4]
