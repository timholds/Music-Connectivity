[Hook: Zap Mama]
Nilipata Rafiki
Na penda rafiki
Na bakie

[Verse 1: Zap Mama]
Sit down here and tell me a story
When you're with friends no need to hurry
No more rush
No more haste
No more
When you're with friends no need to hurry
No more rush
No more haste
No more
No more

[Hook: Zap Mama]

[Verse 2: Black Thought]
Yo, check it out, well it's like
Another day another mic to hold
Hit the planet up with music that's beautiful
Roots carry out business as usual
This collaboration is the next movement yo
Roots crew the regiment Black Thought me llamo
In this thing for life yo, and that's final
Kid you know the title
Ain't no reason to remind you
How I taught hustle
From New York to Brussels
First I hit you in your head and then in all your muscles
Big D we call it Rafiki
And Tariq the definition of a true MC
I'm sub-surface it's hard for y'all to beat me
Check it out

[Hook: Zap Mama & Black Thought]

Time to see sisters face to face
Time to talk time to breathe
I can believe I can believe
I have a friend now I believe
