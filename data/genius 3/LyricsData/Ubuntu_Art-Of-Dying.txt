On the paper are the serpent slides
Trying to face the demon inside
Running the shadow through the jack of time
Those things are the kind of hurting my mind

We die alone
Hush impose
Into the cry
But the truth is you’re not alone
I’m part of you, you’re part of me

I believe you are because I am
I am because you are
Before long after
We die alone

Scattering the surface, the lonely eyes
In a sarcophagus of my own device
Try to talk to my mortality
In the believing is a legacy

We die alone
Hush impose
Into the cry
But the truth is you’re not alone
I’m part of you, you’re part of me

I believe you are because I am
I am because you are
Before long after
We die alone

Yeah, yeah, no, mm
See what the fuck you’ve become
What I’ve become
Like an a…

Like an eighth world wonder
Or a seventh sign
I become an animal
I’m caught in the headlights
Caught in the headlight, in the headlight, in the headlight, light uh
A fucking animal, oh
Your island

All I need is one more chance
Said the lighting to the Lord
Forgive me for what I have done

All I need is one more chance
Said the lighting to the Lord
Forgive me for what I have done

For what I have done
For what I have done
For what I have done
For what I have done
