I've been done by the tax collector

Had by the kids in the street

By the girls in Wisconsin telling their boyfriends about me

So I'm on the next train to Carson

To you

I've made a truce with my fascinations

And drilled myself on my dealings with the urge

And I'm still reading the junk newspapers

Still playing that old brow-beating dirt

But I'm on th next train to Carson

To you

And they can hang me out to dry in Carson

With you

They've only got ones like you in Carson, Wisconsin

They can hang me out to dry in Carson

With you
