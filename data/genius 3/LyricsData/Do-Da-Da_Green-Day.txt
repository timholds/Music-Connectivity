Every time i'm falling down you take the repercussions
Headaches and anxiety, advancing my frustrations
Rush into my depression, sacrifice everything
Wasting me into nothing
Well now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me
Stuck with me

Hand up your soul to my wrists and i'll vow my to trust you
Moving here i always thought
I realized you've imagined
Rush into my depression sacrifice everything
Wasting me into nothing
Well now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me
Stuck with me

Rush into my depression sacrificing everything
Wasting me into nothing well now you're stuck with me
Stuck with me
Stuck with me
