[Kelly:] Beyonce
[B:] What?
[K:] Michelle
[M:] What?
[K:] Look
[B&M:] Where?
[K:] Hold up don't turn your head. Just slowly turn your head
[B:] oh yes
[M:] oh
[B:] Girl...
[M:] He's definitly fine
[K:] That's right

He walks in the club with love in his eyes
As he steps flock, flockin females by his side
Lookin scrumptious, even though he ain't tryin'
The finest thang that you ever did see
The sexy creation had his hat tilted to the side
Starin at me, had my nostrils open wide
Can't even vocalize what I visualize and my body paralyzed
As he smiled at me I said:
Hey boy would you enjoy sittin' next to me in your corduroys?
I'm from Texas my girl is from Illinois
Where you from, can I come visit you sometimes?
My oh my you seem like husband material
Got any chil'ren you
Are you married cause you're very very exordinary, kinda scary
I want your name in my vocabulary

[Chorus 2x]
Lullaby love
Where have you been all of my life?
Your chocolate covered, strawberry, apple pie a la mode

Tell me your dreams and aspirations
What's your furture plans?
What's your motivations?
Boy I'm lovin how you so unpredictible, but I'm feelin you
Admirin’, you might check again
As I step say a prayer
"You available?", so sensual
Lullaby love heartbreakable, so special, baby makeable

[Chorus]

[Kelly Over Chrous]
It’s all in the way you look at me (apple pie la mode)
I’m sure I’ll enjoy your company (apple pie la mode)
You’re turning me on with your modesty (apple pie la mode)
You have such a beautiful personality (apple pie la mode)

HEEEEE

[Beyonce]
So scrumptious love
Apple a la pie mode
