[Verse 1: JXXIII]

Open and delicate
Feeble and celibate
Breaking all the rules cause ya mindset is intricate
Damn and I'm feeling it
Aquarius winning it
Apple of my eyes
Wheel of fortune
I'm spinning it
Damn and we grinning it's
A lovely day to be in love
Baby boy real cause he know
My cup is filling up
Running over, flowing with that the soda food for throught roller
Can I just hold you down...

[Pre-Hook: JXXIII]

I can keep it really real with ya
I can, I can keep it really real with ya
Love, why you playing, what's the deal with ya?
We ain't gotta rush
Can I just chill with ya? (Chill wit ya)

[Hook: Palmer Reed ]

You make me feel so loved
You know I don't want much
Baby, your smiles enough
Can I just feel yo touch?
Show you its real enough

[Verse 2: JXXIII]

Just the simple things
I never ask for much
You my shoulder I'm yo rib
We the bomb, We clutch
And ain't nobody really fucking with us
Low key OGs
And we do what we want
Gone head and burn up the blunt
Get on yo knees and confront
All them demons inside you
That u been holding for months
You been holding too much
Let me ease ya pain
Let me rub ya back
Let me scream ya name
Cause..

[Pre-Hook: JXXIII]

I can keep it really real with ya
I can, I can keep it really real with ya
Love, why you playing, what's the deal with ya?
We ain't gotta rush
Can I just chill with ya? (Chill wit ya)

[Bridge: Palmer Reed ]

I gotta keep it real again
Honest, this is not pretend
It’s not pretend
In love with your confidence
And your body but thats obvious
I promise this:
I’ll always keep it real with ya (real with ya)
Through whatever I’ll be still with ya
So tell me whats the deal with ya
So I can try and build with ya
Cause…

[Hook: Palmer Reed ]

You make me feel so loved
You know I don't want much
Baby your smiles enough
Can I just feel yo touch?
Show you its real enough


Is that real enough?
Is that enough
Real..real…real..
