[Hook: Cheldon McQueen]
Home for the holidays
Chillin' with a broad in my hideaway
Assuming titles, if she thinks she's 'bout to hibernate I'm sayin'
Whatcha doin' whatcha, whatcha whatcha doin'
You got all that fuckin' ass, need to watch how you movin' that

[Verse 1: CM]
Cup runneth over
Eggnog spillin'
My niggas trying to eat
Where's Rick Ross' kitchen?
A thousand downloads make me a little happy
Sing 'em like christmas carols
I call it gift rapping
Trigger finger itchy
Feels like they trying to get me
Half past tipsy
In the trill city
I'm texting my hoes
They telling me, "no"
"Boy you drunk do I look like a Amber the Rose?"
Damn, and I was kind of feeling like the man too
Guess there's only certain wishes they can grant you
Maybach Autumn
The laid back scholar
Mister why flaunt 'em
If you really got 'em
Cause that leads us to believe
That you ain't really got 'em
My dad see success
Say look what I taught him
But be the first to not answer when I'm free to call him
But I ain't trippin', it's the holidays baby what's up?

[Hook: CM]
Home for the holidays
Chillin' with a broad in my hideaway
Assuming titles, if she thinks she's 'bout to hibernate I'm sayin'
Whatcha doin' whatcha, whatcha whatcha doin'
You got all that fuckin' ass, need to watch how you movin' that
Home for the holidays
What's that on my christmas tree?
A note and a mistle-t
Say she got a gift for me
So uh, how ya feel?
How ya, how ya, how ya feel
One hundred percent trill since you've tuned in to that real

[Verse 2: Andrew of DWHB]
Maybe now's the time, maybe today's the day
Maybe this year the year
I ain't really worked that hard, but I worked that heart
And man, I can feel it's near
I gained some recognition, and people praise me daily
This music is my passion, this music's what sustains me
Sometimes it feels like when I get a leg up
Everybody else gets two
It's like goddamn man, how am I the damn man?
I don't got a fucking clue
I got to figure it out, the thing I'm with or without
So I can get that gold
Oh well, home for the holidays
Since when did winter get so fucking cold?

[Verse 3: Travis of DWHB]
First off, I'mma say fuck gin
Don't ever give me that shit again
So many better options if you're gonna make me
Buy a drink to get in
I take a sip and my face contorts
I look over at my two cohorts
But their four eyes are transfixed
On this girl taking off her shorts
I'm home for the holidays
And you don't want to see my face
Now I'm in this club, thinking about the past
And if I text you, what should I say?
My boy tells this girl I'll be twenty on Christmas Eve
Before I know it my hand's in hers, we grab our coats and we leave
What's up

[Hook]
