[Intro: Showbiz]
So we all get into this music shit cause we love the art
This is what we do, whether we getting paid for it or not
But when you get to the business side of it, when you get into the industry
Shit just change man, niggas fall apart, all that other shit
Because it becomes about money and all that bullshit

[Verse 1: A.G.]
We make up to break up, promises are broken
Friends turn to enemies, feelings that we hold in
The fame, make you feel you could do your own thing
Do the money take away the pain?
Whatever the reason, we tripping cause we different
When we started, the energy is missing
Damn, Phife and Tip called it quits
What is all of this, got to be more than hits
Thought Run DMC would last forever
Similar to Salt N Pepa, and the original Spinderella
Pete Rock and CL, Erick and Parrish
These ain't just rappers, they are part of our fabric
Some say it's money, others say it's ego
Some grow apart, look at Goodie Mob and Cee-Lo
Show and AG even when we not performing
Make sure that's my nigga long after we recorded

[Interlude: Showbiz]
You motherfuckers come in the game, y'all niggas stay in the game, man
Y'all niggas keep it funky with each other, man
Niggas start getting Hollywood and shit like that
You know what I mean
Becoming other niggas once you get a little fame and shit
Man fuck that man

[Verse 2: A.G.]
Even my digger niggas took the brand for granted
We supposed to put the city on our shoulders like Menen
It happened with the Roc, PE and Cam and them
Prince Markie Dee and them, questions can't answer them
Not to mention, John Lennon, The Beatles
Diana, Supremes, Mike left Tito
Cube left N.W.A. it was questioned
When Dre left N.W.A. it was destined
Insane, the fame is a roller coaster
Slick and Doug split, after the show was over
Friendship gone, business replace it
That's success, that's the truth let's face it
I want success, the bond so important
Can't pay with my friends, a price I'm not affording
Don't be sad it's over, be glad it once was
Signing off, Show and A, nigga, one love

[Outro: Showbiz]
Yeah man, see this is how it goes down
All you motherfuckers don't know about the game
Y'all wanna get in the game, y'all don't know shit about it
You know what I mean, this shit tear motherfuckers apart
Fake nigga shit and real nigga shit
D.I.T.C. look out for the new D.I.T.C. album coming
2012 nigga, this is what we do, ride out yo
