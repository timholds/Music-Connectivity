Oiii, nahhh
It's Bashy
Naughty Boy presents
Naughty Boy presents innit
You know like mans not on a beef ting out here
Not really I'm just here for the P's and the girls
But don't get it twisted

[Verse 1 - Bashy]

Cause there's the, bat in the boot
Swinging it well, I will bat man like Christian Bale
I wanna get closer to God so I'ma get me a little christian girl
A big bum like Jennifer-L bun that, a big bum like an African girl
Nice face, hair, toes and nails not a frass girl, one who looks after herself
With a nice personality, with goals in life not a broke bitch looking for charity
Not a hood rat girl or a chicken head
A stush chick on the road but she's sick in bed
A wifey who knows what she's on and there's bigger things out there than Louis Vuitton
The kinda girl, Bashy really wants to get to know
And after we've made love hope for an embrio
Ya know

[Hook]

Boy your stare is calling me
Boy you put my mind at ease
We give and we receive
Lets clear anxiety
Boy your stare is calling me
Boy you put my mind at ease
We give and we receive
Lets clear anxiety
Boy you put my soul at ease
We give and we receive
Rudeboy you're my (?)
Your body inspires my love
Finally found love

[Scorcher]

Yeah, I'll break it down like this
You know me, I'm fresh out of Y.O.R and I've got my eye on you
And I've got so much loving to give and I feel like I owe you

(Bracka, bracka)

[Big Narstie]

N dot A dot R dot S dot, girl I feel your style
I'm like N dot A dot R dot S dot, girl you drive me wild
I'm like N dot A dot R dot S dot, girl I'm feeling you
And N dot A dot R dot S dot, soon you'll be my boo

(Oiiii nahhh)
