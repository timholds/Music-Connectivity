Check it out, yeah
Rottin Razkals, Cruddy Click, nigga
I'll have your back on that wall
Get your back off that wall, boy
Ill Town, Inglewood, boy
Get your back off that wall

[Diesel] [Fam]
Hey, word is bond I ain't the one to be played like a fool
Get my temper out of place I'll smack your face with a stool
Hey Fam, man
Girl, you know your swinger's in the house
Grab a hold of your spouse
Cos they're checkin us out
Huh, Hip-to-the-Hop
And let the Glock pop
I knock the fluid out your mouth and watch it drip (drop)
Cos I ain't fakin the funk, you silly chump
I'll be high of that skunk
I mean, really, I mean a Philly blunt
Puff the herbs, then get wicked with the words
Throwin curbs in verse that you never even heard
I'm Naughty as hell
Even Rottin as well
And be ridin your ass
Like an animals' tail
I got the flow
Only you got the flow
Just to let em know
Here we, here here, here we go
I don't know you
So you can't show me nuttin new
Who got it like that?
Nigga, you know we do

[Chorus- X2]
Come on y'all
Get your back up off the wall
Come on y'all
We're bout to,  get it off

[Diesel] [Fam]
This isn't just to let yourself go
Bump with your rump ???, say yo
Peep the frequen flow that you already know
It's from Ill Town E.O
So won't you let yourself go
(Boogie)
The Boogie makes the Boogie pass it down, give it to me
Hard as decks the same jock when his cock got a woody
Hit him hiiiiiigh - hit him loooow
Hits him in the middle just to him know
That I can sing a flow
That I can bring the flow
That it's no thing to flow
So watch me fling the flow
Yo! Congratulations
Of my generation
Creation, rules the nation, the population
Popped inflation
Huh, so next time get it right
And don't confuse our music with that other type, alright?

[Chorus- X2]

[Diesel] [Fam]
This is the focus of the rump of every hottie
(Oh, you don't know?) You better ask somebody
We can throw it like this
When the hit, we won't miss
Grandslam hit on that Rottin-Cruddy tip
It's like that y'all
You don't stop
It's like that y'all
Mack on and mack on, ock
The Naughty nappy jack-happy nigga on the trigger
Light as a feather but figured for a bigger nigga
Because of a...
Rep for wreckin regs, we get respect in this business
Ain't no beef, but watch your teeth
I'll nock you senseless with the quickness
That's for my embryo, I did my number cho
I threw my tongue out
When I was young and came out with the rugged flow
Hip Hop maniac
Vocab like a brainiac
No good hood, swingin wood and not ashamed of that

[Chorus - X4]

[Diesel]
Yeah, 98 style up in yo house
My man K-Boogie
What goin down
Jersey in the place
