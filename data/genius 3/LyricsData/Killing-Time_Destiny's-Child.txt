[Verse 1: Beyonce]
Sitting on the stairway
Hoping that you're okay
Waiting patiently
For you to come back to me
(What should I do)
I don't mind the waiting
As long as there's still maybe
A possilbilty
For you to be true to me

[Refrain 1:]
I'll be sitting on the stairway
'Til a quarter 'til two
With nothing to do, baby, hey, yeah
But twiddle my thumbs and wait

[Chorus:]
Killing time
Waiting on you
What should I do?
I'll be sitting here waiting
Killing time
Waiting on you
What should I do?
I'll be sitting here waiting

[Verse: Beyonce]
Look inside your mirror
I hope that you see clearer
Look behind yourself
And you will find me
I've got your back, baby
The love I have, I'm saving
I'll be there for you
Just like I said I'll be

[Refrain 2:]
I'll be sitting on the stairway
'Til a quarter 'til three
With nothing to do, baby
But twiddle my thumbs and wait

[Chorus:]
Killing time
Waiting on you (waiting on you)
What should I do? (what should I do?)
I'll be sitting here waiting
Killing time
Waiting on you (waiting on you)
What should I do? (what should I do?)
I'll be sitting here waiting (I'm waiting)

[Bridge:]
Oh, baby when you comeback down
Don't forget the love you found in me
I know that your gonna take time
Oh, remember I'm by your side
Don't worry, I'm down for you
No matter what you're going through
I'll be there, I'll be there
Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby, Baby

[Chorus:]
Killing time
Waiting on you
What should I do?
I'll be sitting here waiting
Killing time
Waiting on you
What should I do?
I'll be sitting here waiting

[Outro:]
Killing time (waiting on you)
Killing time (what should I do?)
Oh, baby, baby, baby
(I'll be sitting here killing time)
I'll be staring at the wall
I'll be (waiting on you)
I'll be (what should I do?)
Wonder what should I do
(I'll be sitting here killing time)
I'll be waiting killing time
(Waiting on you)
I'm looking at my watch
(Killing time)
Killing time
(Waiting on you)
Waiting on you, you
Killing time
Killing time
