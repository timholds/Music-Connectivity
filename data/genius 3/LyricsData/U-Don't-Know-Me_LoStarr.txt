[Verse 1: LoStarr]
Same thing, make you laugh, make a nigga cry
The one who claim they real, be out here tellin' lies
My partner 25, they gave him 25
Before you get that cake you gotta pay your tithe
Lord have mercy on my soul, this that life I chose
Far from famous, I'm no stranger to the pot of gold
See some niggas get disposed of tryin' to live that life
I got that wrong up in my trunk, I'm tryin' to make it right
See, I can't trust nobody, so I'm out here solo
I let 'em play me once, but they won't play me no mo'
They tell me stop that hustlin' but thats all I know though
Dedicated to all the people thinkin' they no-low

[Hook: LoStarr] x2
You don't know me
You don't know me
You don't know me
You don't know me
All the shit I done did, all the shit I had to go through
How the fuck you gone judge me? Motherfucker I don’t know you

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Young Krizzle
Walk a half mile up the hill
Just to get my first meal from the racetrack
I went back to the trap house
Makin’ trap beats for the niggas don’t even rap
Hit the Western Union for a couple dollars
My partner say he sent
Cause my light bill due, my water cut off
And my cousin can’t pay the rent
Backpack full of CDs, niggas see me outside every quik trip
From the Eastside, to the Northside, to the Westside
Of the A, one day they gon’ know KRIT
Who don’t know he is?
I was screaming Country Shit way back in ‘09
Then my foreign just touched down
And every hole-in-the-wall before the labels never called since ‘05
Whoever claimed it was overnight?
We stylin’ for a room full of dope dealers
I was 17 years old in the strip club throwin’ dollars
Just to prove I ain’t a broke nigga
If you ain’t got a check, couple bottles on deck
Motherfucker I can’t do a show with you
If you can’t respect that, poverty or crack
I thinks you a ho nigga
You don’t know me
