I've been here all night
Descending into darkness
I've been here all night
Amongst all this silence

I just want to see you
I just want to be here
But it's a little hard
It's a little harder now

Just turn around
And walk away
Just turn around
And forget your name

I need to find the words
To change this awful stillness
I need to see your eyes
Connect with you in silence

I just want to see you
I just want to be here
But it's a little hard
It's a little harder now

Just turn around
And walk away
Just turn around
And forget your name
