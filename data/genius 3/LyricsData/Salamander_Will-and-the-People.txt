Blue is the queue that you're in today
Itll never gets you anywhere, you know
Youre chewing a clue like a cold clich
Tripping up everywhere you go
Gonna go fast when we go to bed
We'll rack up the snow dont you know
And your Ferrari is so chrome red
It screams out money to throw
I took a bit of love from a hard knock life
And manifested something new
I needed to
Do it myself
I used to slither like a salamander
But now Ive got bones in my body to get there
I was living in like a panda
With big black eyes and a bucket of tears
Im like a salamander
Manda
Manda
Manda
Manda
Manda
Manda
Manda
I'm like a salamander
Manda
Manda
Manda
Manda
Manda
Manda
What is the point if you worry away?
Whos gonna tell you not to do so yo?
Do you believe everything people say?
Sipping on your Frappuccinio oh oh!
I look like I've seen a ghost today
Cause I'm easy come, easy go
Shows what I know in my naivete
Which covers me head to toe
I took a bit of love from a hard knock life
And manifested something new
I needed to
Do it myself
I used to slither like a salamander
But now Ive got bones in my body to get there
I was living in like a panda
With big black eyes and a bucket of tears
Im like a salamander
Manda
Manda
Manda
Manda
Manda

No way (a-a-a-a)
I won't slither like a salamander no more
No way (a-a-a)
No way
Im not living in like a panda
So if you slither like a salamader
And now you have the bones in your body to get there
Living in like a panda
With big black eyes and a bucket of tears
I used to slither like a salamander
But now Ive got bones in my body to get there
I was living in like a panda
With big black eyes and a bucket of tears
I was living like a salamander, manda, manda, manda... (a-a-a-a)
I was living like a sala-woooo
OOoooooh
OOoooooh
Pa pa pa pa da
Pa pa pa pa da
Pa pa pa pa da
Like a salamander
Pa pa pa pa da
