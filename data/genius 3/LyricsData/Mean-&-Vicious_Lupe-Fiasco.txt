He's mean
And vicious

[Verse 1]
I can't believe he's that rude
To those stories, those rhymes, that Jew
Then he put 'em on the floor like cat food
And put 'em on the track like glue
Then put 'em on your head like hat
Hey back to you Lu black power
I'm just runnin' with a barrel full of black powder
With a hole in it holdin' it wheezin' deep, breathin'
Runnin' from the fire on the trail I keep leavin'
I can't shake it I swear it's heat seekin'
I keep seekin' somewhere to hide from it, duck and dive from it
But it keep keepin' up just when I think that I've done it
It keep sneakin' up
Oh leakin' barrel of black powder how that flame keep reachin' us
Just one of the long winded extended metaphors of Lu's
This time I use an example of a fuse
To demonstrate how I can't lose
I would put it down but I can't due to the glue
That I use the fuse everything together
Well I spilt some on my hands
And God Damn I might have to carry this forever
Well I'm crazy to the game till they bury me insane

[Refrain]
There once was a boy that grew up on the west side
Of Chicago, liked his hat to the left side
Wasn't in a gang but he was prone to bang
Doin' his thang, doin' his thang
There once was a boy that grew up on the west side
Of Chicago liked his hat to the left side
Wasn't in a gang but he was known to bang like
Doin' his thang, doin' his thang

[Verse 2]
Truthfully I have trouble with second verses
Cause the first one be so intimidatin'
It be bullyin' and pickin' on it instigatin'
Pointin' out all the second ones limitations
Like, 'you ain't nothing but an imitation'
Like bits o' bacon, then he gets the chorus
And the beat to together then they all gang up on him and get to hatin'
But then around the eighth bar
He tires of their conspire and comiseratin
Then he finds his inspiration to spar
He takes a few seconds of judo lessons
Gets back on beat then punches the guitar
They stand in awe like when did you write that
They even right black
First verse already happened
So he don't have a chance to fight back
I like that
Abagnale Junior, check me
You gon' respect me
Aight track
Listen to him, feelin' himself
Swagger up and a few ad-libs to back it up
Lets back it up
I think you've had enough
Give me my mic back
You ain't even write that
Oh its like that
Track stop pumpin' till this niggas stop frontin'
Yeah, yeah, now right back

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
Oh my god
My perils in my odds
I ain't really here what you hear is a mirage
This ain't the delivery baby this is just Lamaze
The ice cream and pickles, the tickle and a massage
The King Arthur, rhythm of the night, El DeBarge
The camoflouge water in the distance
Flogging a camel to get there with the quickness
Mean and vicious
Grinch who stole christmas and hid it in the garage
That was a collage, a barrage I brought all things
That seem king to help this thing start
Jump, jump, my battery charge
I'm bout my green like string beans and beings from Mars
Its a mean thing to be seen with ours
Got that F&F homie I'm a young lil' thriller
I will resurrect homie come back for my killa
In some disheveled apparel with that same leakin' barrel insane

[Refrain]

Its meaaannnnnn
And vicious
