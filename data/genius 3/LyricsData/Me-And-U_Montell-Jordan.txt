(Beginning)
Me and U, Me and U, Me and U.... Come on
Uh, Uh, Uhhh
Listen
I'm feeding girl, I got a taste for you
Baby tell me is it cool if we do those things that
Grown folks do
I know I'm suppose to be a thug and all that
But love you make a brother fall back
Cause you make me anxious and thats a fact...

(Bridge)
She's so hot, she's so hot
Met the hottest chick up in the block
When we make love never wanna stop
No i won't, no i won't, no i won't stop
So i'm gonna take my time work that body 9 to 5
When you get yours girl i know im gonna get mine
So when you gonna step up in this room tonite
(Chrous)
Dont wanna want to rush this thing
Cause I got a thing for you
Dont wanna move to fast
Love should last the whole night through
I just wanna take my time, enjoying every part of you
Come on now, Come now
Its Me and U, Its Me and U, Its Me and U, Its Me and U
Its Me and U, Its Me and U, Its Me and U..... Its Me and U
I'm keeping thoughts of you in my head
Parts of you up in my bed
Yes you got me all twisted up
And I just can't get enough
Got a body thats so tough
Even though you like it rough
And your skin so soft to the touch
She's so hot, she's so hot
Met the hottest chick up in the block
When we make love never wanna stop
No i won't, no i won't, no i won't stop
So i'm gonna take my time work that body 9 to 5
Girl get yours believe i am gonna get mine
When you step up in the room tonite
Dont wanna want to rush this thing
Cause I got a thing for you
Dont wanna move to fast
Love should last the whole night through
I just wanna take my time, enjoying every part of you
Come on now, Come now
Its Me and U, Its Me and U, Its Me and U, Its Me and U
Its Me and U, Its Me and U, Its Me and U..... Its Me and U
She's so hot, she's so hot
Met the hottest chick up in the block
When we make love never wanna stop
No i won't, no i won't, no i won't stop
Dont wanna want to rush this thing
Cause I got a thing for you
Dont wanna move to fast
Love should last the whole night through
I just wanna take my time, enjoying every part of you
Come on now, Come now
Its Me and U, Its Me and U, Its Me and U, Its Me and U
Its Me and U, Its Me and U, Its Me and U..... Its Me and U
