[Verse 1]
I won’t blame it on you but it’s a hard cold fact
Like a bolt from the blue, I just can’t hold back, no
Blame it on me 'cause I know I’m weak

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I so wrong 'cause all I want is a chance and hope

[Chorus]
You won’t love me when it all goes up in flames
You won’t want me when no one knows my name
Oh life is hard, and you’re so fast to always put the brakes on me
But I know you won’t love me when only us remains

[Verse 2]
When you hold me that way, you make it so hard to leave
Like the sun to the rain, you’re just an endless tease
You take it from me, you take it so easily

[Pre-Chorus]
Am I so wrong 'cause all I want is a chance and hope

[Chorus]
You won’t love me when it all goes up in flames
You won’t want me when no one knows my name
Oh life is hard, and you’re so fast to always put the brakes on me
But I know you won’t love me when only us remains

[Post-Chorus]
You won’t love me, you won’t love me
You won’t love me, you won’t love me, I know
When it’s all gone up in flames
When no one knows my name

[Outro]
You won’t love me when only us remains
