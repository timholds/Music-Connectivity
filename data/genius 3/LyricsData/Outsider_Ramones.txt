[Chorus 1]
I am an outsider
Outside of everything
I am an outsider
Outside of everything
I am an outsider
Outside of everything
Everything you know[x2]
It disturbs me so

[Chorus 2]
Everybody tried to push me
Push me around
Everybody tried to put me
Try to put me down

[Verse]
All messed up, hey everyone
I have already had all my fun
More troubles are going to come
I have already had all my fun

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1]
