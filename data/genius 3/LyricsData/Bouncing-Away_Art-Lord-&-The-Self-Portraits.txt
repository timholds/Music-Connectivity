I have you like I have the sun
Left to see you but never to touch
Mind is mine and you wanted it as such
Bouncing away as I back into you

Spent cycles leave this one out off to dry [?????]
You are my love and you know and exploit that
Bludging my heart with your kisses
Say that you love but don't want me
Tell me I'm an ocean, but won't swim within me
Insted you extend me, just like a baby
And blow kisses as to befriend me and mother me
Bouncing away as I back into you

[Chorus]
No one really cares, no one even cares these days
I will be the fool, I will be the fool with no name
I will play every little game and it's still the same, looking away
Bouncing away as I back into you

And now we're looking for the same thing
There once was so much between us
And now our love's all wrong
But it's the dream that leaves me sad

[Chorus]
No one really cares, no one even cares these days
I will be the fool, I will be the fool with no name
I will play every little game and it's still the same, looking away
Bouncing away as I back into you

And now we both crashed out
And we'll never see the same
I was caught in the fire, lost in the flames
Backing away, backing away
Wondering how, wandering why, things stay the same
No one really cares, no one even cares these days
I will be the fool, I will play the guessing game
I will be the fool, looking towards you
Bouncing away as I back into you

All lovers go
Bouncing away as I back into you
