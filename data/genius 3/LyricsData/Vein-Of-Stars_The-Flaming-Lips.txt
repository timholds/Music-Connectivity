[Verse 1]
Who knows
Maybe there isn't a vein of stars calling out my name
No glow from above our heads
Nothing there to see you down on your knees
25, 26, 27
Off in the future maybe there is no heaven
It's just you and me
And maybe it's just as well
And if there ain't no heaven
Maybe there ain't no hell

[Verse 2]
Who knows
Maybe there isn't a vein of stars calling out my name
Who knows
Maybe there isn't a vein of stars calling out my name
Who knows
Who knows

[Outro] [x2]
Who knows
Who knows
Calling out my name
