[Intro: Frukwan]
Yo
Back again in the midst's of the dirt and the lurky mud
In the dark clouds and the pitch black skies
In the stages of triple darkness
I spark this, microphone
To, inject y'all, to a lethal dose
Of Knowledge, Wisdom and Understandin
From the original mans plannin
Yo, take it for what it's worth
I own the planet Earth
For real

"There are a lot of questions I'm gonna ask you about this week
But the idea of living other than yourself
I'm not gonna put it down"

[Frukwan]
Burnin mothafuckas like garbage
Livin the largest of our feline cats
Stalkin alley ways pitch black
Do the level in pursuit, I'm snipin a mothafuckin devil
Paranoid, unemployed black rebel
Cover ups, fatality spawn bodies
Fatality, blood stained walls, that's formality
Witness the army kamikaze, symbolic to Kadafi-a
Fuck the mafia
A threat, ten national securities
For bein 400 million Fists Of Fury
In front of your lord
Weapon moves swift, gas mask, infared
Four devils ahead (huh)
Historical proportion, controllin chunks of land
Belongin to the original man, what?

"Of course you do, of course you wear a mask
Of course as a child you learned
That your natural self was not acceptable
I understand
I understand that your parents didn't want you to be
Who you were
And your siblings didn't want you to be who you were
I understand that"

[Frukwan]
(Fuck you)
Dialog got the tools sparked, brain puncture true
Salmonize with your boo, yo
It's critical, graveyard crew live thick
The mind of the great scientific
Find of all kinds, forget it
Absence, scale casualties, mild disease
Foul remedies, enemies
Lurkin and desertin, criteria's menace, suicide
Tidal waves out in Venice
Then it's just a matter of time
Your mind go through the Alpine, tryin to confine
Fire storms dropped in a tablet, gushin from the gasket
Metal car, push cart caskets
