I was born with a poisoned lung
Born under a blacked out sun
Where I lost my everything all at once
They overdeveloped us
We underproduced them
You don’t blame them for what they did
I do this is the end time

What is this place
Who are these beings
They look like us
Something’s different deceiving
The original crime
To conquer to divide
Death from the beginning
The end of all life

Timeless numbers
Where everyone’s been bought and sold
There will always be a failure to guide us
There will always be a loss of control

So bless me with death
For this life has failed me
Rest for the unrest
This was forever
And now that I’ve seen your face
And looked you in those hollow eyes
I see the reason
The story of a world consumed
Timeless numbers of prior life forms
All have been lost

And in the wake of it all
After they’d drilled to the core
The blast was everlasting
The blood will always pour

Let no one wake you
Forgive or forsake you
The eye of the creator
Is blind to us all
