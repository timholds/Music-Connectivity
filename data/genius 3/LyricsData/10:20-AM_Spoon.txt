[Chorus]
10:20 AM 10:20 AM
When will I ever see you again
10:20 am
When will I ever see you again

[Verse]
I carry you out
It starts to sink in
When will I ever see you again
You'll be with me still
Ever from now 1020 AM
Because I remember everything you did
And
Everything you were
Everything you said
Yeah I remember everything you did

[Chorus]
