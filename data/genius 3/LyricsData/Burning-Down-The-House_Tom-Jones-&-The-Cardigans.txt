Fightin' fire with fire

Watch out, you might get what you're after
Cool babies, strange but not a stranger
I'm an ordinary guy
Burning down the house

Hold tight, wait till the party's over
Hold tight, we're in for nasty weather
There has got to be a way
Burning down the house

Here's your ticket pack your bags: time for jumpin' overboard
The transportation is here
Close enough but not too far, maybe you know where you are
Fightin' fire with fire

All wet, hey you might need a raincoat
Shakedown, dreams walking in broad daylight
Three hundred sixty-five degrees
Burning down the house

It was once upon a place sometimes I listen to myself
Gonna come in first place
People on their way to work, baby what did you expect
Gonna burst into flame

Fightin' fire with fire
Fightin' fire with fire
Burning down the house

My house, s'out of the ordinary
That's right, don't want to hurt nobody
Some things sure can sweep me off my feet
Burning down the house

Watch out, you might get what you're after
Cool babies, strange but not a stranger
I am, I'm an ordinary guy
Three hundred sixty-five degrees
Burning down the house

Fightin' fire with fire
Fightin' fire with fire
Gonna burst into flame
Fightin' fire with fire
Fightin' fire with fire
Fightin' fire with fire
Gonna burst into flame
My house

No visible means of support and you have not seen nothing yet
Everything's stuck together
I don't know what you expect staring into your TV set
Fighting fire with fire
Burning down the house
Ooh
Burning down the house
