[Intro]
Sanity
I'm bout to tell yall a story right here

[Verse]
You see I'm 12 years old with a nasty flow
I don't play with the kid
I don't play when I'm bumping out my show in the biz
Krissed krossed out
I'm like that miggidy miggidy miggidy mack; Totally Krossed Out
I got my city on my back I'm bout to set the match now
If you coming for the kid, well you better back down
I ain't worried bout now haters wasting my time
And i know it's a struggle in Maryland State of Mind
Like a nigga, who wouldn't keep his finger off the trigger
He shot the bullets into this nigga, and cuz I'm black
They gon think that I'm gon do something that bad
The only guns that i cock is the ones in my pad
I got my older brother as a witness if you don't believe me
When you really hear the truth, i swear that you ain't gon deceive me, oh man
It's not about the people in the streets, It's more about the ones and they beat, up on they feet
Now i ain't living in that B-More style, but i swear in Columbia it get really wild
They be shooting at the mall
They be shooting at the crowd
They would kill anybody
They would even kill a child, it's a mess
Living in that environment's a struggle
You might not think so, but i hustle i make you fumble
So next time you try to stop my grind, imma give it to you;
The Maryland State of Mind

[Outro]
The MD State of Mind

The MD State of Mind State of Mind
