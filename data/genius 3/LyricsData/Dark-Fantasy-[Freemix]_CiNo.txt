CiNo lay it down to the beat
Got a TEC-9, spray rounds full of heat
Uh-uh, kick you out of the seat
This is my throne, nigga bow to my feet
Talking 'bout rap while I'm taking over it
Yall gon' sink, I'll stay afloat like Noah's ship
Keep talking shit, go ahead, throw a fit
No one gives 3 shits, just try to coexist
I'm bringing heat to the table with some gasoline
Once I'm on the mic you niggas fucked, no Vaseline
Straight uncut, killing wack rappers, torture them
Drain all they blood, that's how the fuck we go to war with them
Sick bastard, I swear I spit cancer
It's answered, I got this shit mastered
We spit faster than all you bitch rappers
Niggas be feelin' themselves a little bit too much, you'll get blasted
