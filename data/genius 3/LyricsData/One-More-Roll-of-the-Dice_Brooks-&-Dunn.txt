[Verse 1]
You ain't been thinking this through, now have ya?
The last thing you need is the thing that you keep coming back to
The memories still fresh in your mind
The way that you lost with it all on the line
More than you could justify
But she gives you that look and you just gotta try

[Chorus 1]
One more roll of the dice
Maybe just one more shot in the dark
An' one more chance that your luck might change
While you still got a little something left in your heart

[Chorus 2]
She's a game you can play
Not a game you can win
But one more roll of the dice
And you're believing again

[Verse 2]
Maybe you are still hanging onto what it felt like
The higher the stakes the bigger the rush when it goes right
But when you're a gambler in love
Having it all is never enough
It's a curse when it gets in your blood
You're down to your shoes but you can't give it up

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2][x2]

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]
