Well my friend had to go down south, into the sunshine
Well my friend had to go down south, with his girlfriend
While I'm just sitting here waiting for you, drinking hot chocolate
While I'm just sitting here waiting for you, thinking about old people
Old people in the sunshine

Old people in the sunshine
Old people in the sunshine
Old people in the sunshine
Old people in the sunshine, we're old people in

Well my friend could be on the beach now, building castles
Well my friend could be out there dancing, with his girlfriend
While I'm still sitting here waiting for you, drinking hot chocolate
While I'm still sitting here waiting for you, thinking about old people
With lots of clothes on

Old people in the sunshine
Old people in the sunshine
Old people in the sunshine
Old people in the sunshine, we're old people in

Old people in the sunshine
Old people in the sunshine
Old people in the sunshine
Old people in the sunshine, we're old people in
