[Intro: sample (P.R. Terrorist)]
For security reasons
I am broadcasting tonight from an undisclosed location
Because the subject of tonight's American expose is terrorism
(Killarmy in this motherfucker)

[Chorus: Killa Sin]
Yo, Killarmy, we the last Armageddon
Prepare yourself now for the 6 Man Wetting
In the streets or in the sand war is on
Now aside nigga, here comes the pride

[Verse 1: P.R. Terrorist]
You can't persuade this brigade Killarmy renegade
On this crusade lyrical murder is sure to be my trade
Draw more heat than Black Suede, I'm the Sun beaming on your dome When the shade is nowhere to be found
All you hear is the unrenowned sound
That makes your eardrum pound, you can't avoid it
It been exploited in your district
The ballistics are statistics fuck the critics
They criticize while I revise my enterprise
Do the knowledge and you'll be surprised
General Wise keeps currency alive
While strong soldiers build with boulders
Forts and barriers, my brain pattern hold weight like a freight
Sharp like ice skates, blow this track like a cellmate
Then motivate, now I'm out of state using my Papermate
To penetrate through open minds that take the time to listen to
The Crimson Tide that I provide, I dedicate my life to my poetry
If it's meant to be then let it be
It's only right I'm out for the night, my life's a legacy

[Verse 2: Killa Sin]
It's like I remember slap boxing now we clap shots to catch props
From knocking rocks on the block to chop the fat crops and jock
I see the Jakes and motivate cause half my team be holding weight
We march across the Golden Gate Bridge, my mind is in the soldier state
Forever real, troops will never squeal, so my Berettas peel
Leisurely and infiltrate your mental shield easily
I'm pleased to be the man hundred grand in tan Lands
Now my Clan's doing tours in Japan and San Francisco
Liver than disco packing nickel plated pistols
And keep my block hot like burning Crisco

[Break: Killa Sin]
Wu-Renegades, deadly switchblades

Chorus 2X

[Verse 3: 9th Prince]
Renegades are slayed in steel cage
I wave war blades at United Snakes parade
The unforgiven law of no mercy, build controversy
Then perform surgery, Killarmy, we meet at a ninety degree angle
Universal star angels, we form the tip of a triangle
Like Egyptians did, I perform inside pyramids
Wu-Tang, a scientist labelled me the last lyricist
For today's Genesis, surrender
Take you on an adventure like being kidnapped by seven ninjas
Supreme marine I move in submarines
Anti-murderer, stage burglar
Rugged rhyme asserterer, put the mic on crutches
Lyrical ruckus, build to destruction, Destructicons
Best to kill in camouflage, Desert Storm
On the battle before I lost an arm
Held on to my sword took both hands like Voltron
Like the master who's imperial, king of the scenario
To all my universal soldiers, salute the general

[Verse 4: Beretta 9]
I come armed with explosive chemicals
Extremely physical Killarmy individuals
The concept of principles that are highly indispensable
My name is Born God Allah came to North America on a ship
And was stripped of my knowledge and wits
Death to all enemies by your own fucking penalties
Off with your dome, I roam through your war zone
With a platoon full of soldiers with dust bones
Ain't nothing but the army shit with military warheads
Tie you up in your barracks, with heat-seeking lyrics
I'm out for revenge like a tribe full of Indians
I break down your physical change it to a chemical
_____ made of wickedness, the black man be original

Chorus 2X

[Outro]
Let it vibe, homicide, suicide
