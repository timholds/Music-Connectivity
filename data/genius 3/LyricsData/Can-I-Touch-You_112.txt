Can I touch you baby
Come here baby, yeah

Can I touch you
Make you feel so good
I know you want me to
So sweet my goodness, love so sexy
Won't you come and talk to me
Can I speak to you make you feel good
I know you want me to so sweet
Goodness, love so sexy
Won't you walk over to me

[Verse 1 - Slim]
In the middle of the night
You walk into my room
The streetlight sillouettes your face
And all of me
Consumes a special part of me
There's a lonely part of you
And in this we'll find happiness
In a little thing called truth
Can I

1- Can I touch you there
Fingers through your hair
Baby don't be scared
'cause I've got you
Where you need to be
Hold you tenderly
Something you won't forget

2- Can I touch you
Make you feel so good
I know you want me to
So sweet, my goodness love so s***
Won't you come and talk to me

3- Can I speak to you
Make you feel good
I know you want me to
So sweet, goodness love so s***
Won't you walk over to me

[Verse 2 - Daron]
All the time I spent
Lookin' in your eyes
I don't feel time is wasted
I swear I am not lying
(Lying here just to take advantage of you)
Do you understand
This is something I wanna do
Can I

Repeat 1
Repeat 2
Repeat 3
Repeat 2

Come over here
And take my hand
Ooohh don't be afraid
Oooohh, stand right here
Can I

Repeat 2
Repeat 3 until fade
