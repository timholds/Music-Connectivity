You drew a map so we'd remember
All the places that we went to
And although we never meant to
We lost it on our way

You drew a map so we'd remember
How to get back to the highway
But instead we followed moonlight
And were completely led astray

And we had
Traveled this way
All of our days
And we will keep on
Following the dotted lines
Till we find a better place

We took a trail down to the beach where
We'd heard the music play before
The fires they went on forever
Like flaming jewels along the shore

We sat there soaking up the starlight
And sang out loud to every song
Though we didn't know the words
We made 'em up as we went along

And we had
Traveled this way
All of our days
And we will keep on
Following the dotted lines
Till we find a better place

We have
Traveled this way
All of our days
And we will keep on
Following the dotted lines
Till we find a better place

Drew a map so we'd remember
All the places that we went to
And although we never meant to
We lost it on our way

And we have
Traveled this way
All of our days
And we will keep on
Following the dotted lines
Till we find a better place

We have
Traveled this way
All of our days
And we will keep on
Following the dotted lines

We have
Traveled this way
All of our days

We will
Travel this way
All of our days

We have
Traveled this way
All of our days

We will
Travel this way
All of our days

All of our days
