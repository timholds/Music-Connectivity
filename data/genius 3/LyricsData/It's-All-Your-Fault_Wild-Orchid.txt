It's All Your Fault
Every time you look at me
I forget to breathe
Now can't you see?
How I like how you make me feel
When I act this way, you're the one to blame. Oh no
You should be careful what you're wishing for
You make me lose all my self-control. Don't you know

What I need what I needed from you
What I want what I want you to do
You make me feel this way inside my heart its all your fault
What you do when it's already done
I want more I can't get enough
You make me feel this way you are the one, it's all your fault

Oh yeah
You've only got yourself to blame
Baby ooh ooh It's all,it's all, it's all your fault
Every time that you try to play so innocent
You're not so innocent (no no)
But you got me right right where I want to be
Oh can't you tell you can blame yourself
You know exactly what to do and say
I don't know how much more I can take (oh you know)

What I need what I needed from you
What I want what I want you to do
You make me feel this way inside my heart, its all your fault
What you do when it's already done
I want more, I can't get enough
You make me feel this way you're the one, it's all your fault

Weren't you the one that had me right from the start? (the start)
Weren't you the one who really broke into my heart?
But you know I left the key right, right there where you could reach it
You started this so you, you've got to finish it

What I need what I needed from you
What I want what I want you to do
You make me feel this way inside my heart its all your fault
What you do when it's already done
I want more I can't get enough
You make me feel this you are the one it's all your fault

What you did is done
You've only got yourself to blame
Blame it on you
It's all, it's all, it's all your fault
Blame it on you only on yourself
Can't blame anybody else
Blame it on you only on yourself
Everything you do you do so well

What I need what I needed from you
What I want what I want you to do (what I want, what I want baby)
You make me feel this way inside my heart its all your fault
What you do when it's already done
I want more I can't get enough
You make me feel this you are the one it's all your fault

What I need what I needed from you
What I want what I want you to do
You make me feel this way inside my heart, its all your fault
What you do when it's already done
I want more I can't get enough
You make me feel this you are the one it's all your fault
