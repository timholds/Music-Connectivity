[Intro]
Okay, K-R-I-T
Mississippi representer well connected to Atlanta
DJ Folk mixtape
Yeah I'm from the bottom nigga (Mississippi)
Get that shit
Ay what they call me?

[Verse 1]
They call me KRIT
I got my swagger back
The flow and the momentum make em stagger back
Take a good luck at em nigga that you're future
After him you retire nigga that's you're future
Everybody wanna know where the K gon' sign
If the independent pays man then K won't sign
Rather stick to the streets cuz the streets is real
What I look like broke with a million dollar deal
I'm like [?] do bad all by myself
Got my own fuckin' label I sign myself
Cuz the broke don't shine, the dead don't breath
Close your mouth all you want me but I'm gon' eat
Cuz I'm tired of you stereotyping Southern rappers
Like I was born in the stables workin' in the pasters
The only red dirt is on my truck
The only [?] down sittin' on my [?], please

Nigga get ya issue (get ya issue)
I paint a perfect picture (perfect picture)
While we takin' over
Gettin' major figures
Two months two mixtapes I did that
My place my forces who could fit that
Ay I'm a beast when it comes to the beats
And I'm the hottest thing out when it comes to the streets
Went a hundred miles per hour [?] crash
Make tracks and write fire nigga I'm [?]

A lot of niggas walkin' round feel my aura
Dig my vibe and they love my story
Went from no name nigga to the next one in it
But this is far from fixin' this the life I'm livin'
Ask [?] he'll tell ya yeah we run
Told me to skip breakfast go straight for my dinner
Took my napkin [?] tight and sit down with the greatest
I'm the last of my kind I belong to this table
Hey you, you ain't never seen nothin' quite like it
Eighteen spittin' fire nothin' quite like it
So let's take it back to the blocks and the rubber bands
No jewels no necklace just a rubber band
Flier than a 7-47 nigga
I'm the doc of the bay like Otis Redding nigga
Waitin' on my spaceship like one day
I'm a couple years late I just missed Kanye

[Outro]
I got my swagger back
Ay, I got my swagger back
Ay, they call me KRIT
K-R-I-T nigga
Ay, I got my swagger back
I got my swagger back
Hats of nigga
(I'm knee deep in the game)
