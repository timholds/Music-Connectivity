Ghosts in the photograph
Never lied to me
I'd be all of that
I'd be all of that

A false memory
Would be everything
A denial
My eliminent

What was that for?
What was that for?

What would you do
If you saw spaceships
Over Glasgow?
Would you fear them?

Every aircraft
Every camera
Is a wish that
Wasn't granted

What was that for?
What was that for?

Try to be bad
Try to be bad
