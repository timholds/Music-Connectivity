I’m a moth
I cling to my friends
To get the the best rays of light
The ones that stick to your skin
I’m shining ! Oh! look…I’m shining!
I’m burning ! Oh! look …I’m burning!
CHORUS
I want Lux
I’m not Robin Hood
I love the black light of Wood
I want to be seen in the woods
Playing the oud, playing the oud
I’m not very bright
Neither glow-worm, nor coleoptera
I just want to rub my backside
In the light of a street-lamp
I’m shining ! Oh! look…I’m shining!
I’m burning ! Oh! look …I’m burning!
Although I see clearly that
The light does nothing for my complexion
I’d die for a dream born of Adam and Eve
CHORUS
