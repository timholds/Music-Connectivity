[Verse 1]
I never met a girl who makes me feel
The way that you do (You're alright)
Whenever I'm asked who makes my dreams real
I say that you do (You're outta sight)

[Pre-Chorus 1]
So, fee-fi-fo-fum
Look out baby, cause here I come

[Chorus 1]
And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, so get ready

[Post-Chorus 1]
Cause here I come (Get ready cause here I come)
I'm on my way (Get ready cause here I come)

[Verse 2]
If you wanna play hide and seek with love
Let me remind you (It's alright)
But the lovin' you're gonna miss
And the time it take to find you (It's outta sight)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So, fiddley-dee, fiddley-dum
Look out baby, cause here I come

[Chorus 2]
And I'm bringing you a love that's true
So get ready, so get ready
I'm gonna try to make you love me too
So get ready, so get ready cause here I come

[Post-Chorus 2]
(Get ready cause here I come) I'm on my way
(Get ready cause here I come)
(Get ready)

[Bridge]
If all my friends should want you too
I'll understand it (Be alright)
I hope I get to you before they do
The way I planned it (Be outta sight)

[Pre-Chorus 3]
So tiddley-dee, tiddley-dum
Look out baby, cause here I come

[Chorus 2]

[Post-Chorus 3]
(Get ready cause here I come) I'm on my way
(Get ready cause here I come)
(Get ready cause here I come-a)
(Get ready)
