[Verse 1]
I get out on the redneck side every now and then
Call up my baby she comes over and the party begins
She's a slick nickel she's right on the money
I wouldn't give her up for a thousand buckle bunnies
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk
She's got my number, knows my favourite songs on the jukebox
Goes to getting down like crazy and the whole place rocks
We'll have a few and get to feeling right
She'll be my queen bee I'll be her neon knight
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk

[Chorus]
Oh Oh I love her so
Stand back give her room
Boys and watch her go

[Verse 2]
She's a looker, heads turn when she comes through the door
A show stopper when she gets to going out on the floor
We leave all our troubles and cares way behind us
I feel like I'm a king when I'm out with her highness
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We leave all our troubles and cares way behind us
I feel like I'm a king when I'm out with her highness
I'm her big cat daddy, she's my little Miss Honky Tonk
