[Intro]
Yeah
Sing it with me y'all
Oh, oh yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
Can we wait just a minute
Slow it down for a minute now baby
You're talkin' loud, you're wildin' out
Don't seem like my old lady
Let's go and play the song we used to play
Can we reignite the flame
'Cause things just ain't the same

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We can talk about the baby
We can talk until we're crazy
We can focus on it now
Or we can focus on it later
We can start another fight
We can argue and fuss all night
But I propose that we go to the floor
And we slow dance

[Chorus]
Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with your man yea
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move
Move, yeah

[Verse 2]
Can we wait just a minute
Turn that TV off for a minute
Now politics and talkin' shit ain't really none of my business
Let's go and play the songs we used to play
On that old school radio
Let the music soothe your soul

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Forget about the world
I'm groovin' with my girl
Forget about the news
Let's put on our dancin' shoes
Let's not talk about the war
Don't know what they're fightin' for
I propose that we go to the floor
And we slow dance

[Chorus]
Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with your man, yeah
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move
Move, yeah yeah
Move, yeah yeah

[Bridge]
I love it, I love it, I love it
Slow dancin' together
I love it, I love it, I love it
Slow dancin' together
I love it, I love it, I love it
Slow dancin' together
I love it, I love it
I propose that we go to the floor
And we slow dance

[Chorus]
Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with your man, yeah
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move
Move, yeah yeah
Move, yeah yeah
