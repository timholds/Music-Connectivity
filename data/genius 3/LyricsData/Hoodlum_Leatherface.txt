Hoodlum speed and chewing gum he's on his lonesome
Like a fish is hooked look at the violence look
I'm hopeful I won't be there consensus vote there's not a hope
It's got me by the scrote parasite and speeding camera light
And I will be there
In the palm of my hand I hold these grains of sand
And if I cling to you tight will you be there
You smoke dope every day while I drink my nights away
And if I close my eyes tight you'll still be there
In peacetime there's no peace of mind lop-eared old man
Cheap blinds you pay your parking fines and angels do sing
And in the palm of my hand I hold these grains of sand
And if I cling to you tight you'll still be there
You smoke dope every day while I drink my nights away
And if I close my eyes tight will you still be there
Paraquat what exactly is that and I don't need it
Good times has many rhymes then I'll be there
And in the palm of my hand I hold these grains of sand
And if I cling to you tight will you be there
You smoke dope every day while I drink my nights away
And if I close my eyes tight will you still be there
In the palm of my hand in the palm of my hand
Angels do sing angels do sing
