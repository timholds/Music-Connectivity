You're with me from my first cup of coffee
Right up till that last beer goes down
You're on my mind so I can't sleep till morning
You're the busiest memory in town

Had a drink last night with your new love
But then he mentioned a few more you'd found
So we drank a toast to the next one
And the busiest memory in town

Babe, sometimes you simply amaze me
With how fast you spread that heartache around
It must be hello, I love you, I'm leaving
You're the busiest memory in town

If there's a place where all broken hearts go
You'll be their queen, yes, you'll wear their crown
The whole east side is walking the floor tonight
You're the busiest memory in town

The whole east side is walking the floor tonight
You're the busiest memory in town
