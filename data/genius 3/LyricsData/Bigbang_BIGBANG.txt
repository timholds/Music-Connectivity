C'mon everybody let's all get down

Suckas don't wanna come test my poundin

Drownin' see they weren't original

That when I rock the mic my super duper flows
Come hittin' left to right whatever way it goes it's whoa
Freezing yall like zero below I be'zin total control fa sheez I'm more than you know yo

[Gd]
Yo yo yo they sayin this 'n that so pitiful

You be runnin for your dear life man
How ya like me now I'm livin real tight man
Don'chu wish you had the honeys like mine man

Gd don't get it till the day there ain't no life 'n

Yo, my baby
She told me, that I was her one and only
She's no phony, she's my roni
And she would always like to ride my pony
(Are you all in love?) That's right no balony
(Are you pushin up?) That's right no balony
Word homie, she's all for me
That's how we kick it, that's the end of story

My baby told me it gets real tonight
'n I'm so excited gonna do it right what I wanna do
What I'm gonna do - Ain't no thang, to my game
We'll be doin the do, It's just me and my baby

[Hook:]

So just let it go and get into our swang baby
