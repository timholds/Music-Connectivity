[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

[Verse 1]
I'll write a song
I thought about it for far to long
But I never had someone to sing about
Until I met her and each days get better
Nobody knows
Nobody sees
Nobody else understands me like she
Now there I know what true love means
I Just hope she stays with me

[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

[Verse 2]
She wants to breathe
She wants to be where the grass is green
She wants to know how love supposed to be
She wants it better
I want to let her know
She belongs right here with me
She's heard it all but I'll make her see
I'll make her fall
Make her believe
I promised her that I'll never leave

[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

[Bridge]
I just had to write a song about her
Tell her I don't wanna leave without her
Tell her that I would build my world around her
Deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter
I'll never leave her alone

[Chorus]
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

Each day gets better
I just can't let her go

Each day kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no
