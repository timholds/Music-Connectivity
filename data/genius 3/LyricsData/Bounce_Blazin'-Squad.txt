Eh yo, flava
Yo, r u ready 4 dis?
Ha
Lets go
I never get written in dis
Neva wrote so many hits
Back, Slake same old lyrics I miss
Back

Never dismiss
Type of remedies lyrical clock this *****
Don't u know them 10 man click
In the beginning
There were 2 decks and a microphone
Oh no
That's the shear excel
Comes from another world
U no my lyrics being held to sell
Im too hot for most
Never boast
Tonight's the night to get high on my flows and im the host
To hold all the bangos, (u know this)
Never get wen I wana mine, never get wen I wana my flow
The score has been sold
Get out my face, u get bumped before ur too late

Lyric lyric likes it faster like woah
Who's that danger-ous mc, from the blazin family
S-pp-i-k double e
Ten man click thro London city
Change over, ur change my flow
Speeding 4 my mile tempo
Boy dem blind n ain't dat so
Like 5 0 5 0
Im also quick If I ad my presto's
STOP
Sonic booms sonic booms
Down dat old road
Boy der hot and that its send off
Like woah
Who's da danger-ous mc
From the blazin family
S-pp-i-k-double e

[Chorus]

Basian caucasian
Hearts will b breaking (breaking)
Its kinda hard coz chicks c thro me
Lock the door coz turn just thro me (Oooo me)
Hearts swallowing my love like sarfie
Coz u don't need gurls saying LT (Oooo)

This man gets taken back 2 the drawing board

Who's guna b da next 2 contest?
Coz ill knock them out wiv my rythmin txt
Guna skip round when I jump straight to da next
So hear wat I say

One bag to da first and take out da rest
Stand tall, get vexed, da best of the best
Spitting out my lyrics to the north to the west
Guna finish my lyrics like a bullet proof vest

It's the B O N U C to da E
Wiv da standard flo dat went 2 number 3
Wiv da mic in our hands
Going on angry
Yo 10 school m8s
Growing up daily
Non of ya'll thought we cud make it dis far
All of ya'll fort we were chattin blah blah
Now who's da one larfin, har har
We've left u behind
And we're going on far

Im a krazy man
Guna stay da same
Coz I get up on da mic
Put u 2 shame
Coz im going on an-xious delay
Guna frustrate u, wiv a big cold bang
Ur 2 blame, get the game, wats my name, stay the same
Ur guna get chong by the blazin flame
Yo, I got krazy brain that go out thro my mouth and in thru my veins

So do u like da lyrics dat I bring
Mc-in but still got da ching ching
Still got da bling bling
Talking bout me on da mic n ting
Ow do u know I got me cru blazin
Now its time 4 sum action
Blazin comin back wiv a lyrical attraction
Ride wiv da rhythm ride wiv no tracks
N u beta listen up u best pay attention

[Chorus]
We can make u bounce (bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce)
We create da sound (bounce bounce, bounce, bounce)
This year's guna b ours (bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce)
