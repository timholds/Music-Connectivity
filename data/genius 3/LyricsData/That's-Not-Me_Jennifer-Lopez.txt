[Verse 1]
Said she gave you everything
She broke her back to be
What you need
I tried so long to just compete
Can't take no more
Losing sight of me
I'm letting you know this can't go on this one way street
I'm walking alone
This time I'm breaking free
I'm going to find me

[Chorus]
I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more
That's it
I tried so hard to be
What you wanted me to be
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
Because baby that's not me

[Verse 2]
Don't want you to think that I'm selfish
I'm just sick of your one track mess of you can't meet me
Halfway I think it's time that you be on your way
I love you but I can't baby you
If it's your mama you want
You know just what to do
I looked in the mirror everyday
I saw myself
Fading away
You trying to mold be into her
I loved you so I put you first
But I can't live my life this way

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I was so lost in love before I couldn't see the light
But now I'm strong enough to leave you now
So you better treat me right
Don't want to throw it all away
So baby
Here's your last chance
Don't want to fight with you
But I need more of you
Give me all
Or it's the end

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I cooked, I cleaned
I washed your clothes
You were so mean, so ungrateful at night
I cried so many times
Tell me how could you go diss me
When you know one day you'll miss me
If it can't be 50/50
Then baby that's not me
I can't, I won't, I can't, won't
