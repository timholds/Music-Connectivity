Mona Lisa
Music: Imai Hisashi

Sleep—don't you want tomorrow?
If you tremble you can't hold on till dawn
I hear nothing see nothing say nothing
Kraus Hyper Opera voice song resounds
Adios Amigo, an Alchemist looking for a pile of garbage
Long long ago, we embraced, digging our fingers into the flesh*

You look like you’re going to freeze
Tell me, so you can stop shivering
You look like you’re going to freeze
Tell me about you, so you can stop shivering

I want you to teach me, I want you to tell me
If I’m dirty or strange, what does it matter?
I want you to laugh, I want you to look at me
It's fine if you do me the favor of shooting me*

On the hill overlooking the savanna
Son of a gun by oneself bursts into tears
Are you there? Please touch me
My body starts to tremble inside
I'm covered in goose bumps in the depths of the water
Convulsions are embraces, the buzzing in my ears speaks to me
Long long ago, lukewarm drops of water drew threads
You and I can never meet again

You look like you’re going to freeze
Tell me, so you can stop shivering
You look like you’re going to freeze
Tell me about you, so you can stop shivering

I want you to teach me, I want you to tell me
If I’m dirty or strange, what does it matter?
I want you to laugh, I want you to look at me
It's fine if you do me the favor of shooting me*

I want you to teach me, I want you to tell me
If I’m dirty or strange, what does it matter?
I want you to laugh, I want you to look at me
It's fine if you do me the favor of shooting me*
I want you to teach me, I want you to tell me
If I’m dirty or strange, what does it matter?
I want you to laugh, I want you to look at me
It's fine if you do me the favor of shooting me*
