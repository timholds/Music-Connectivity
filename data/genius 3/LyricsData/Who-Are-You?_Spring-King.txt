[Verse 1]
I feel it getting hotter
Waiting for the water to put out the light
Nothing is forever
Nothing stays wrong if you make it right
Let me fight the feeling
Kicking, punching my way to the top
I’m not round forever, not round forever
For just one day I’d be something better

[Chorus]
Tonight I just wanna be somebody else, somebody new
Tonight I just wanna be something that I can say is true

[Verse 2]
I need some of your power
Need some of that power you got
There’s something in the water
Something in the water, something in the water
Let me fight the feeling
Kicking, punching my way to the top
Let me know when the world stops turning
I’m tired of fighting, tired of hurting

[Chorus]
Tonight I just wanna be somebody else, somebody new
Tonight I just wanna be something that I can say is true
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?

[Bridge: Saxophone Solo]

[Chorus]
Tonight I just wanna be somebody else, somebody new
Tonight I just wanna be something that I can say is true
Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? Who are you?
