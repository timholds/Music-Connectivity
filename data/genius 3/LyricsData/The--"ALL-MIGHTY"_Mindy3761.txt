Feel the LOVE of the 'ALL' might
All mighty scream sing truth right
Left them wondering left them dizzy
Government loses in it's fit now hissy

The ALMIGHTY loves to hear song
LOVES all His children, He's always along
Breath lies out then let Him truth in
We're now in a skirmish, plots thickening

Just a short season til a new wave of shit
But we can't stop just grin and BARE it
I wrote awhile back EMPERORS need new clothes
EXPOSE alla the bullshit while wigglin your toes!

Give the feat some rhythm, rhyme the man understands
He is afterall just a child in mans land
Poor puppet he is Obama is caught up
But maybe , just maybe he'll sense our Buck

Falala! LA LA LA LA, LA LAW
