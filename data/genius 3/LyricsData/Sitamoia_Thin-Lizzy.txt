(chorus)
Hey mister can I shine your shoes?
Hey mister can I sing the blues?
Hey mister do you think it's gonna snow?
Hey mister my heart belongs to glasgow

Hey mister can I ask a question or two?

Hey mister what are we supposed to do?

Children abandoned and left to america
Children forsaken in ethiopia
Hey mister so you think it's gonna snow?
What about the children though?
