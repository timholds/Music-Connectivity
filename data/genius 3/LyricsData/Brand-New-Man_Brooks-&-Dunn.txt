[Chorus]
I saw the light
I've been baptised
By the fire in your touch
And the flame in your eyes
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man

[Verse 1]
Well the whole town's talking
About the line I'm walking
That leads right to your door
Oh how I used to roam
I was a rolling stone
I used to have a wild side
They say a country-mile-wide
I'd burn those beer joints down
That's all changed now
You turned my life around

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I used to love them and leave them
I'd brag about my freedom
How no one could tie me down
Then I met you
Now my heart beats true
Baby you and me together
Feels more like forever
Than anything I've ever known
We're right on track
I ain't looking back

[Chorus][x3]

[Outro]
I'm born to love again
I'm a brand new man
