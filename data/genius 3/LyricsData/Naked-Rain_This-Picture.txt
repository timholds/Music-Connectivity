The gates are open, my eyes are wide -
Burning the candle that keeps me alive
Going in blind, going in blind
The waters cold, cold, cold murder
So bring it back to me, bring it back to me and take me in...

She is warm, willing, deep and giving
She is cold, chilling, painfully forgiving
Let it be wild, let it be warm, let it be everything

Your lips move me, your eyes move me, colder than the rain
Your arms hold me, your body fold me deeper again
So run with me, run with me, colder than the rain

She is wild, killing, so I start living
She is warm, thrilling, painfully forgiving

Let it be wild, let it be warm, let it be everything

Your lips move me, your eyes move me, colder than the rain
Your arms hold me, your body fold me deeper again
So run with me, run with me, colder than the rain

Every branch of your body has broken
Every arch of your body has spoken
So bring it back to me, bring it back to me, and take me in

Your lips move me, your eyes move me, colder than the rain
Your arms hold me, your body fold me deeper again
So run with me, run with me, colder than the rain
