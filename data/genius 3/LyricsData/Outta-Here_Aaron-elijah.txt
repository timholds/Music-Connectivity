[Verse 1: aaron elijah]

Im busy thinking
While dizzy drinking
Time is priceless bros lets get lost in the moment
Knowledge is power how much does it cost to know it?
I learn from my mistakes these are teaching scars
For now I'm looking up.. Trying to reach the stars
So I keep a hand on the flag of our nation
Then hit up the crew and buy a bag of relaxation ("yo lets reup")
I need to catch up to my expectations
There's a bitter taste in my mouth
So I spit these words out
I was quiet now I shout
I used to doubt
Now musics what I'm all about
It's going up from here never south
My heart will forever be beating with the beat
I saw music in my dreams we were meeting before the greet
And I can't believe these memories are soon to be what used to be
Still I'm ready for what's new to me
Now I'm blowing off steam like im at a hookah bar
You must lose yourself to find who you truly are
So I keep thinking!

[Hook]
Get me outta here

[Verse 2: DG]

I've had it up to here
My hand to the ceiling
About to leave this town
I got a good feeling
The only thing I'm gonna miss is all those nights.. chilling
Even on the nights we had nothing to do
We found something to do
I learned a lot from you
Like to tango it takes, at least two
So no matter what happened the next day, it's, ("bro we cool")
And i love that, i got the mace out
To keep the past back
On a new route
Like a blind man and colors i'mma miss these mother fuckers
We're not changing I'm ready lets go I'm done waiting!
Need my shades for the future I'm facing
Remember four in the back, two in the trunk
Half of us drunk, in a red jeep
Saying...

[Hook]

[Verse 3]

Aaron elijah:
Guess to get change you must change your environment
So I'm waving bye to it
Going to Boulder and growing older
The best is yet to come
I'm leaving but i'll never forget where I'm from

DG:
Young and dumb
Big dreams like the car driven by a soccer mom
College kid!
I'mma be a Ram when I hit campus
Forever young, even when we're all grandpas
In the fast lane not crashed yet just some parking lot door dings
Child hood done now I'm outta here like four rings

[Hook]
