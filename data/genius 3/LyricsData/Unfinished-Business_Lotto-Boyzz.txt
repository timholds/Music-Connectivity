[Intro:] AYD, Are You Dumb Boy

[Chorus: Ash]
Take time pon me don't run away
Cus baby we got unfinished business
She said:
(Come see me one day)
Cus I don't wanna waste no time
Telling me you don't love me
Cus baby girl, what is the difference
We both (need somebody)
To please our body
And...
We ...
Will...
Not ...
Tell no one
Cus baby we got unfinished business
You ain't gotta try so hard with me
Cus baby we got unfinished business
And they don't know what they want
Cus baby we got unfinished business
So they ain't guna go as hard as we

[Verse 1: Lucas]
Shawty got a sexy body and it's calling me
Baby playin games why you stalling me
Standing at the bar need some company
Holding on your waist take this shot for me (na na na)
3 shots take them one by one
Flexed all night long
She said I'm not the one
And she wanna sing my song
She stalling young nigga balling
She calling me now she boring
Big bumpa girl put your all in
She want link up and turn naughty
And they don't know what you want
From what you want
I'm what you want
Now they wanna sing my song

[Chorus: Ash]
Take time pon me don't run away
Cus baby we got unfinished business
She said:
(Come see me one day)
Cus I don't wanna waste no time
Telling me you don't love me
Cus baby girl what is the difference
We both (need somebody)
To please our body
And we will not tell no one
Cus baby we got unfinished business
You ain't gotta try so hard with me
Cus baby we got unfinished business
And they don't know what they want
Cus baby we got unfinished business
So they ain't guna go as hard as we

[Verse 2: Ash]
Girl when you whine slow I can not control my feelings
Your [?] can go viral if you give it up to me
Tease me tease my bla bla bla
Do re mi fa so la la la
If you need my bla bla bla take care of nana
Shawty got a shot gun
She pull it out and then she pop one
We popping bottles like it's popcorn
Going once, going twice any option
And we will not tell a soul on the telephone
If you're flexible I'll text you
Oh just

[Chorus: Ash]
Take time pon me don't run away
Cus baby we got unfinished business
(she said:
Come see me one day)
Cus I don't wanna waste no time
Telling me you don't love me
Cus baby girl what is the difference
We both need somebody
To please our body
And we will not tell no one
Cus baby we got unfinished business
You ain't gotta try so hard with me
Cus baby we got unfinished business
And they don't know what they want
Cus baby we got unfinished business
So they ain't guna go as hard as we
Cus baby we got unfinished

[Outro: Ash]
Take time pon me don't run away
Cus baby we got unfinished
Come see me one day
Cus I don't wanna waste no time
And you don't love me
Baby girl what is the difference
We both need somebody
Please our body

Baby we got unfinished business
You ain't gotta try so hard with me
Baby we got unfinished business yh yh
Baby we got unfinished business
Ohhh, yh yh
Baby we got unfinished business
