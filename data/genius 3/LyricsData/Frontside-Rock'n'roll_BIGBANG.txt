You don't have to
You really don't need to
Just because I
I am going to
I am going to

Now all the flowers
Have been broken
But we watched them
For a while
And we know you got
Your token
So go on
Don't miss your ride

Another life
Inside a mirror
Of our big blue
Distant sea
Some find joy
Among the horror
Then we'll slip in
Eventually

Have a ball
With all the mermaids
And here's a line
I wrote for you:
Hit the spine backside disaster
And exit frontside rock'n'roll
