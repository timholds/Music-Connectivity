[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]
Drive my Coupe DeVille around with the windows down
Whippin' on these niggas, I'ma flex
All my niggas wear crowns, we on higher ground
Can't see none of you niggas, watch us...

[Verse 1: Ingrid]
Smokin' with the windows down, just like it's legal
Straight chillin', plus I'm sippin' Crown, I'm in the Regal
With the tags that's from out of state
I've been boomin' since I made that move from out of state
But now I'm back
I'm in that black on black on black on black
I'm parkin' on the sidewalk and givin' niggas daps
Every time I hit the streets I'm with my real fam
On some ghetto fancy shit, I feel like I'm I'm in B*A*P*S
You know we 'bout to flex

[Hook: Sevyn Streeter]
Drive my Coupe DeVille around with the windows down
Whippin' on these niggas, I'ma flex
All my niggas wear crowns, we on higher ground
Can't see none of you niggas, watch us flex
It's a ghetto reality
Life's but a dream so forgive me if I flex
A nigga feelin' so elegant
Like I'm wearin' white linen on a yacht in the south of France
Understand I'm gon' flex
I'ma flex out loud
I'ma flex out loud, loud, loud
I'ma flex out loud, loud, loud

[Verse 2: Ingrid]
I know you hear that sub beatin' down the block
Ridin' clean is my religion 'case you hoes forgot
It ain't a damn stain on me, boy I swear for Lord
Ingrid Bergman reportin' live from Third Ward
I go harder than them niggas and them bitches too
I been did all the shit you did and what you didn't do
And of course I'm into men, I just ain't into you
And yes that was me in the 6 and now I'm in the coupe
Shit, you know I'm known to

[Bridge: Sevyn Streeter]
All my friends, all this gold
All this change, au revoir
We don't know how to act
Never had nothin' before
Never been nowhere before
Waterpark was a fire hose
D-boys posted at the corner
D-boys posted at the corner
Our negroes, amigos
Hoes and the rastas
We got goals, we want more
Dreams of designer
Straight nigga mentality
Gotta get it by any means
Gotta do what we gotta do
Nigga we on, let's act a fool
And flex
Please excuse, flex, flex, flex
Straight nigga mentality
Gotta get it by any means
Gotta do what we gotta do
Nigga we on, let's act a fool

Out loud, loud, loud
I'ma flex out loud, loud, loud
I'ma flex out loud, loud, loud
I'ma flex out loud, loud, loud
