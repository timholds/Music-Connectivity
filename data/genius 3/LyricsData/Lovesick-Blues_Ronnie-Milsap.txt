I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord, since my baby's said goodbye
Oh, I don't know what I'll do all I do is sit and cry, oh Lord
That last long day she said goodbye, oh Lord, I thought I'd cry
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kinda lovin'
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream, I hate to think it all over
I've lost my heart it seems I've grown so used to you somehow
Lord I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues

Well, I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal but she don't care about me
Lord, I tried and tried just to keep her satisfied but she just wouldn't stay
But now that she is leaving here's all I can say

I got a feelin' called the blues, oh Lord, since my baby's said goodbye
Oh, I don't know what I'll do, I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you, somehow Lord, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
I'm lonesome I got the lovesick blues

I've grown so used to you, somehow Lord, I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues

And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues
Girl, I'm lonesome cause I got the lovesick blues...
