[Verse 1: Prodigy]
Ayo, Queens get the Money long time no cash
I'm caught up in the hustle when the guns go blast
The fool retaliated so I had to think fast
Pull out my heat first, he pull out his heat last
Now who the fuck you think is living to this day?
I'm tryna tell these young niggas crime don't pay
They looked at me and said "Queen's niggas don't play
Do your thing, I'll do mine kid stay outta my way"
It's type hard tryna survive in New York state
Can't stop 'til I'm eating off a platinum plate
Po po comes around and tries to relocate me
Lock me up forever but they can't deflate me
Cause having cash is highly addictive
Especially when you're used to having money to live with
I thought step back look at my life as a whole
Ain't no love it seems the devil done stole my soul
I'm out for delfia, selfia, P's not helping ya
I'm tryna get this Lexus up, and plus a cellular
Yo, Big Noyd! (What up cousin?) I can't cope
With all these crab niggas tryna shorten my rope

[Verse 2: Big Noyd]
Yo, it's the R-A-double-P-E-R
N-O-Y-D, niggas can't fuck with me
Coming straight outta QB
Pushing an Infiniti
You ask can I rip it constantly? Mentally?
Definitely, to the death of me, come and test me
Trust me, nigga couldn't touch me if he snuff me
So bust me, you're gonna have to, cause I'ma blast you
My lyrical like a miracle, ill spiritual
I'm born with it, I'm getting on with it
And I'ma have it 'til I'm fucking dead and gone with it
Cause I'm a what? Composer of hardcore, a lyrical destructor
Don't make me buck ya, cause I'm a wild mothafucka
You know my flow, you know my steelo
Even pack my gat when I go to see my PO
Jump out my hooptie, pass my gat and my lucci
To my shorty in case my PO try to troop me
To the island, and if I start wildin
Flipping on niggas walking around with the nice gold medallions
But she didn't violate me, so I escaped see
Back to Queen's pumping the fiends making more CREAM
Know what I mean? I'm a natural born hustler
Won't try to cut ya, pull out my 4 4 and bust ya

[Verse 3: Havoc]
Hey Yo, ain't no time for faking jacks cause brothers that fake jacks
Get laid on their backs, the streets is real
Can't roll without steel, I feel how I feel
Cause I was born to kill, do what I gotta
To eat a decent meal, brothers is starving
Don't try to find a job son, it's all about robbing
So don't be alarmed when we come through
We supposed to, if you opposed to, get your face blown dude
Off the map, cause I react, attack
A brother wasn't blessed with wealth, so I act like that
Drug dealing, only mess with shorties thats appealin
I'm fronting on the world once I start 4-wheeling
Cause back on the 41st Side, we do a ride
Sipping E&J, getting bent all night
Yo, who that? I never seen him in my whole life, step to his business
Cause it's only right, po-po ain't around so I grab my pound
Money retaliated so I hit the ground, my life is on the line
Gotta hold my projects down, can't see myself getting bodied
By a clown.....ass nigga that ain't even from my town
Hit him up in the chest and now he's laying me down dead
And up from under the benches I started hearing sirens
I stop firing, to cut ass like a diamond, jetted to the cribpiece
What a relief, stashed the heat then proceeded to peep
Out the window, call my son, "yo son we got beef
But no question, money had a problem so I solved him"

[Verse 4: Prodigy]
I got my mind on the stick-up, now it's time to get paid
Thinking of ways to take loot already made
There's crime in the air, ain't no time to be afraid
Give me yours and get laid, give up the goods and get sprayed
I got lots of love, for my crew that is
No love for them other crews and rival kids
All them out-of-town niggas know what time it is
And if they don't, they need to buy a watch, word up
Caught up in the cross-fire get theyself hurt up
While I be sipping gin straight in a plastic cup
On a park bench on 12th Street, my whole crew's famous
You tried to bust your gat and keep it real but you nameless
First of all slow down, you on the wrong route
Let me put you on your feet and show you what's it all about
The street life ain't nothing to play with
No jokes no games kid for years I been doing the same shit
Just drinking liquor, doing bids, extorting crack heads
And sticking up the stick-up kids
