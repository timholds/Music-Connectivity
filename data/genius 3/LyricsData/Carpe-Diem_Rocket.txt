[Pre-Hook: Kadey James]
Shout out all the ones
That make sure things always get done
Making sure things always run
Though your workload weighs a ton
Moving mountains on your own
Turning houses into homes
Maintained, babe
Maintained

[Hook: Tee]
This goes out to my maintained ladies
Driving around in your maintained Mercedes
Driving around in your maintained Audi
Driving around in your maintained BM
More than a wifey, more than a BM
Living your life like carpe diem
Living your life like carpe diem

[Verse 1: Rocket]
This goes out to the carpe diem ones
Good mums, not BM ones
Don't act too bait
Goes down in the bedroom, not in the DM ons
Life's hard when I'm running about
But it's you who's running it now
I get mad when you're running your mout
But you're running around and still running the house
I love that
Little smile that I see on ya
Make guys wan' pree on ya
Fresh LBD on ya
Think it'd look even better with me on ya
How ya maintain so?
The love that you give? Can't contain, no
You're mean in the bedroom, mean in the boardroom
We spend time cuh she worth a fortune, yo

[Verse 2: Scorcher]
Your property, your property
Honey, you're like oxygen, like oxygen
And I don't know why you dress so good
And I don't know why your head so good
And I don't know, I don't know
And I don't know, I don't know
Shout out you know who, you know why
We ain't gotta do the vows, you and I
Ex man dropped you out, suicide
When I ain't in the bits, we do the [?]
When I ain't in the bits, you do the pics
When you don't send the pics, you send the vids
Cuh you work extra hard, you're extra thick
So you make man X [?]
