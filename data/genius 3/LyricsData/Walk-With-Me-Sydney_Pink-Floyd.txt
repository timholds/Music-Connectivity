Ooohhh
Walk with me, Sydney
I’d love to, love to, love to, baby you know

Ooohhh
Walk with me, Sydney
I’d love to, love to, love to, love to

Walk with me, Sydney, it’s a dark night
Come on, come on, hold me tight
Well, I’d love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-up brain …

Ooohhh
Roll with me, Sydney
I’d love to, love to, love to, baby you know

Ooohhh
Roll with me, Sydney
I’d love to, love to, love to, love to

Roll with me, Sydney, it’s a dark night
Come on, come on, hold me tight
Well, I’d love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-up brain

Ooohhh
Walk with me, Sydney
I’d love to, love to, love to, baby you know

Ooohhh
Walk with me, Sydney
I’d love to, love to, love to, love to

Walk with me, Sydney, it’s a dark night
Come on, come on, hold me tight
Well, I’d love to, love to, love to
But I got

Flat feet, fallen arches
Baggy knees and a broken frame
Meningitis, peritonitis
DTs and a washed-up brain
