Verse two: a.g.i love hip-hop, not rock and roll

I've been a giant since i was a kid
They always thought i was big from the damage that i did
I roll up rappers like a dt
And don't worry yo, because the brothers can't see me
Light-skinned curly hair i keep dwellin
I don't care about my hair, my records are sellin
A.g., my right hand man is kay-gee
Kenny dope you know, marley marl is my little bro

And if you said that i didn't, then i got jerked
You musta asked the wrong people

Never back down, my crew's in the background
I get hyped when showbiz lays the tracks down
