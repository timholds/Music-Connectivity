[Verse 1]
Boy I never knew I could feel
The way I felt, when I felt
They way you were feeling me baby
I'm so out of control
Everytime you look my way
I realize more and more
How much I adore those pretty eyes of yours
I'm helpless baby
What I want to know is
Are you willing to try
Can you love me for a lifetime
In just one night, oh

[Chorus]
Baby I love you
Love You
Baby I need you
Need You
I got to have you
I got to have you baby
Can't be without you
Be without you
Baby I love you
Love You
Baby I need you
Need You
I got to have you
I got to have you baby
Can't be without you
Be without you

[Verse 2]
Blessed and cursed on the same day
The day that I first felt the power of you
Inside of me
Such a strong feeling
There comes a time in everyone's life
When you know that everyone around you knows
That everything has changed, you're not the same
It's a new day
Oh, what I want to know is
Are you willing to try
There's gotta be more meaning to this than what meets the eye

[Chorus]
Baby I love you
Love You
Baby I need you
Need You
I got to have you
I got to have you baby
Can't be without you
Be without you

Oh, I love the way you kiss me
Baby please
I'm about to lose my mind
Oh, talk to me
Because I'm begging for you and I'm down on my knees
Baby I know you're the one that I need

[Chorus] [x4]
Baby I love you
Love You
Baby I need you
Need You
I got to have you
I got to have you baby
Can't be without you
Be without you
