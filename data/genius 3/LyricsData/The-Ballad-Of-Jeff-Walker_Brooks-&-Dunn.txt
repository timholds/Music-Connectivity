Jerry Jeff Walker stumbled up the stairs on his way to the
Stage with a Martin guitar and a six pack
Yeah and he was the poet of the Lone Star state

And I was young enough
To think I was good enough to be his opening act
And in a cloud of smoke he took another toke
And counted one, two, three
And I knew right there just breathing his air
What I wanted to be

Buckaroos and jaded lovers
L.A. freeway and redneck mother
Mothers who had raised a son so well
Talking outlawed, long hair loners and stoners
Singing about to come back home and
Most likely too far gone to get there

Hey, Kix, that was 76
That was just enough beer to get us through the set
And get as high as our crowd
We got 700 miles Jerry, we gotta go
You're out of your mind; you'll never make it on time
Why not just have another round

Oh, we were trying get paid
Just trying to get laid
Living on love
Sleeping on the stage
Just turn another page
Never thinking we'd ever grow up

Buckaroos and jaded lovers
L.A. freeway and redneck mother
Mothers who had raised a son so well
Talking outlawed, long hair loners and stoners
Singing about to come back home and
Most likely too far gone to get there

Well, the way I recall the 70's
We were down in Austin and the establishment were
Saying we were wasting our time
The next thing I know
We were making more money than we could count
We're all being sued by the IRS
And having more fun than the law allowed

Yeah, I'm talking loners and stoners
And sing about to come back home
And most likely too far gone to get there
Yeah, they were all most likely too far gone to get there
