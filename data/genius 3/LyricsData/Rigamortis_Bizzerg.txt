[Hook 1]
Got me breathing with dragons, I'll crack the egg in your basket you bastard
Im Charles Manson, plus Danson, plus Mantic. That's swag that just can't be standed
Now now don't ask for your favorite rapper!

[Hook 2]
He dead, I killed him
Amen, Yep Yep
He dead, Chuuch
Amen, Slut!

[Verse 1: Bizzerg]
I am flossin' the cost is a set that's awesome
Of course it's that West Norriton white martian armed with a- J J Johnson
Size P portion for your gorgeous, little flawless call her darling
Like Rawling I am Ballin, like Babe Ruth she keeps calling, shots
Of Goose Keep pouring one too many way too often. Say I'm stalling?
Cuz I'm shittin' with no commas, Not pausing I am all in
Not Autumn but what's fallin' Is my shot like Khalif, through the net to your feet
Run the game with no sneaks, fuck pain, never weak
Every day, every week 65 add a 3, that's in front. Who's in front? Number one, MB!
Cumbersome, Under him, those tryna' compete. My flows are like a stream, imposed on every beat
In a manner unlike manners, go bananas when I speak
I'm like standup to grammar, just like grandma squeezing cheeks
Swipe cards that are V, unless it's my fake ID
Hit the deli for a treat and I ain't talking bout meat
Fuck beef, just toast. Crack Open my forty!
These rappers are boring, my rap is transforming
Rap for the moment as it passes before him

[Hook 2]
He dead, I killed him
Amen, Yep Yep
He dead, Chuuch
Amen, Slut!

[Verse 2: Mark No Shark]
It's a party party, celebration, cheers to kids just off probation
Passin by the station for a couple citations, keep them blunts in rotation
Berg's basement Killin cases
I'm clean so don't have any records, but I'm wanted for murder on the track
I run over them like Air Maxes or your favorite running shoes, where's the hate I know it's coming soon
Roll with me people we'll show you what to do, shot out to 268 the BLACKOUT CREW!
Were a blessing, having no recolection- of any our nights. The sins we did couldn't be forgived in Confession twice
Rap game dying down so I'm coming to give it a life. It's a test and I know the answer
No Guessin, North Sessions listen to it that's my suggestion, Killin it my first impression!
Realest kid since 93, almost 2013 now that's murder to the first degree
I know you'd agree, Shark be the remedy

[Hook 1]
Got me breathing with dragons, I'll crack the egg in your basket you bastard
Im Charles Manson, plus Danson, plus Mantic. That's swag that just can't be standed
Now now don't ask for your favorite rapper!

[Hook 2]
He dead, I killed him
Amen, Yep Yep
He dead, Chuuch
Amen, Slut!

[Verse 3: Bizzerg]
This is studio Felony, Mb on the M Melody
Call it mental telepathy, way smarter than the AVG
Abc's droppin' frequently, half of it's like them frequencies
Coming out of your speakers G, A S A P
Preferred straight form the Burbs, Concurred once heard
For sure getting buzzed tokin on that Purp, Swerve!
I start to choke- Herb, got me UP like Serge
Ibaka, I'll Block ya', Shot stoppa', in my cupboards
Ciroc of that Vodka stock up for the weekend getting splurged
That's 50, 100 hunnit, so what my cash is redundant, word !

[Hook 2]
He dead, I killed him
Amen, Yep Yep
He dead, Chuuch
Amen, Slut!
