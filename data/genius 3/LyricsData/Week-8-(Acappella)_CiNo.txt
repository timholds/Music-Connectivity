The only reason he's green
And likes to crack on people is cuz he believes
Being an asshole's gonna get him past those
Nice mat-doors, I mean door-mats, little rascals
The rap shows and tracks sold
Stack dough and contribute to his cash flow
Also, in rap I've killed more than Fidel Castro
Trash those wack hoes and blast more Jazz-O
I'm indie while Atlantic remains Lupe's fiasco
I got work that'll make you lean back like Fat Joe
Make American idols lose themselves like Astro
Your truth be lies, to be fly I don't need no passports
You won't fast-forward me, rewind and run it back slow
When bitches hear me, they wanna drop that ass low
You rap so wack it drags longer than watching grass grow
And that's facts, bro
