Girl I want your body close
You on top of me
Can you feel it
I'm gonna make your body drip all over me
Baby me inside of you
Soooo take off all your clothes and throw them on the floor
You won't need them
Cause I'm gonna give you every little thing you need and more
Let me tell you what I wanna do

[Hook]
I wanna make love sweet love
All night long to the rising of the sun bring
Your body close to mine and it feels so right
Don't let go of me
I wanna make love sweet love
All night long to the rising of the sun
Bring your body close to mine and it feels so right
Don't let go of me

Baby I can give it to you any way you like it
You just let me know
I'm giving you the key so you can drive me fast or slow
Cause on this ride of love we're gonna go to places you and I ain't never been before
Baby imagine me kissing all over you your body's trembling
I know your feeling me
Ooh now it's getting serious and I'm tired of being curious
Girl my body is filled with lust
I can't take it no more
I am about to explode

[Hook]

Girl the chemistry between us I can't explain
I love to hear you call my name
I can see it in your eyes that you want me too
Don't you be afraid of what I'm gonna do to you
Girl the tears you cry are out of happiness
Pleasure instead of loneliness
Eeeeevery single part of me inside of you
Pleasing you teasing you
Making sweet love
