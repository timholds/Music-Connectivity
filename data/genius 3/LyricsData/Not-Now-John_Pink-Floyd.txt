[Verse 1: David Gilmour & Choir]
Fuck all that, we've got to get on with these
(Fuck all that, fuck all that)
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
There’s too many home fires burning and not enough trees
(Fuck all that)
So fuck all that, we've gotta get on with these
(Gotta get on with these)

[Verse 2: Roger Waters & Choir]
Can’t stop, lose job
Mind gone, silicon
Tsar bomb, what bomb?
Get away, pay day
Make hay, break down
Need fix, big six
Click, click
Hold on, oh no
Bingo! (Bingo!)

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Make them laugh, make them cry
Make them dance in the aisles
Make them pay, make them stay
Make them feel okay

[Verse 3: David Gilmour & Choir]
Not now John, we've got to get on with the film show
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hollywood waits at the end of the rainbow
(End of the rainbow)
Who cares what it’s about as long as the kids go
(As long as the kids go)
So, not now John, we've gotta get on with the show
(Gotta get on with the show, gotta get on, gotta get on)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4: David Gilmour & Choir]
(Gotta get on, gotta get on, gotta get on)
Hang on John I've got to get on with this
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
I don’t know what it is, but it fits on here like- tsss
Come at the end of the shift, we’ll go and get pissed
But now now John, I've gotta get on with this
(Gotta get on with this, gotta get on)

[Bridge: Roger Waters]
Hold on John, I think there’s something good on
I used to read books but- (ineligible)
It could be the news, or some other amusement
Could be reusable shows

[Verse 5: Roger Waters & Choir]
Fuck all that, we've gotta get on with these
(Doo, doo, wah)
Got to compete with the wily Japanese
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
No need to worry about the Vietnamese
(Doo, doo, wah)
Got to bring the Russian Bear to his knees
(Gotta get on)
Well, maybe not the Russian Bear, maybe the Swedes
(Doo, doo, wah)
We showed Argentina, now let’s go and show these
(Gotta get on, gotta get on)
Make us feel tough and wouldn't Maggie be pleased?
(Doo, doo, wah)
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na
One, two, Free Four!
(One, two, Free Four!)

[Outro]
S’cusi dove il bar? (What?)
Se para collo pou eine toe bar?
S’il vous plait ou est le bar? (Say it in English!)
Oi, where’s the fucking bar John? (Oh, now you’re talking!)
(Oh! Rule Britannia! Britannia rules the day)
Down! Go, Maggie!
Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, Hammer, now!
