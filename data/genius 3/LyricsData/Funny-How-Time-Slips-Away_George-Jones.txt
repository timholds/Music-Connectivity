Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing?
Oh, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been been so long now, and it seems that it was only yesterday
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away
How's your new love?
I hope that he's doin fine
Heard you told him, that you'd love him till the end of time
Now that's the same thing that you told me
And it seems likes just the other day
Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away
--- Instrumental ---
Gotta go now
I guess I'll see you around
I dont know when though
Never know when I'll be back in town
But remember, what I tell you
That in time your gonna pay
And it's suprising, how time slips away...
