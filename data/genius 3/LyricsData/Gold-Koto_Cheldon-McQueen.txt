[Intro]

[Verse 1: Cheldon McQueen]
Nigga I ain't fall off, not even a little bit
Walk up in this bitch throwing ones off an elephant
Half my niggas off in the whip getting hella lit
Your girl a six, but we hit it for the hell of it
I'm out that H-O
With the type of niggas pop a preacher for a payload
On a pacer for these pesos
And you can't get it less I say so
Nigga, I got the Juice! (Juice)
I pull up hit the lights on the coupe
Young nigga living life how I choose
Don't ever let a nigga tell me how to do me
I was 12 writing speeches for my Grammy
Fruity loop pattern clickin' at my granny house
They always ask me Chelly what the fuck you planning on
To have Juno out here playing with my analog
God damn nigga I'm the motherfucking man now
Used to not have a pot to piss in, now I'm cooking hits funny how this shit done panned out
You don't like what you see change the channel
I'm on one
On one, on two
I'm too real to come out here and lose
For any nigga tryna fit in my shoes like a fat bitch wearing them jimmy choo's

[Bridge: Cheldon McQueen]
This one for all my niggas (2x)
Dog and we ain't letting up
I got a bad bitch Jada Pinkett; Set It Off
And I tried to tell em..
My team just all for winning (2x)
And the squad up, everything's all us, would give you a call but...

[Chorus: Cheldon McQueen]
Nigga I been jamming that can't tell me nothing for a week straight
Future millionaires it all started with a mixtape
Cards all maxed like TJ, Hey!
Still doing a hundred on the freeway

[Verse: LE$]
It's something old, thinking 'bout some new shit
Ducked off I'm the nigga that your boo with
Vibed out this the life that I'm in tune with
You ain't really on 'til you make your whole crew rich
Tryna come up with something to make a little change
See 'em biting your style that shit a little strange, damn
Guess I gotta switch it up again, just another corner that I gotta bend
$x$ eat good that's the motto that we follow
And tell her grow up if her ass don't swallow
Dippin' in the slab bumping "Run In The Sun"
I sell clothes I'm just rapping for fun, I'm just fucking with you
Getting mine long as the sun shine
All a player ever really knew was grind
I'm riding on mirrors, ain't feeding hoes dinner
Better go and check the stats cause you ain't no winners, like

[Bridge & Chorus]
