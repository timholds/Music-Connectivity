[Intro]
Bronx!
Boogie down
You know who this is (Yeah)
On the six uptown

[Verse 1]
Me and, my girls
Ready to rock the party
Slide in, the club
Pickin' up everybody
Places, hoppin', jumpin'
Got the new jam bumpin'
It's on and crackin' tonight, yeah

[Chorus]
I step into another world (Another world)
As soon as I start to dance (Yeah...)
Out on the floor
It's always been the only place (Only place)
When I'm looking to escape
Baby you can do the same
Let your troubles go
Baby let it flow
Just let who you are really show
You need to take your time
Play your part with mine
It'll all be fine
Let your troubles go

Party people get your hands up (Yeah)
Get your hands up
Baby
Party people get your hands up
Get your hands up

Sweatin', grindin'
Gettin' packed but I really don't mind it...
And then the beat is just getting started as I, bounce
I'm drivin' all the players crazy as I, bounce
I'm doin' it just for me


[Chorus]
I step into another world (Another world)
As soon as I start to dance
Out on the floor
It's always been the only place (Only place)
When I'm looking to escape
Baby you can do the same
Let your troubles go
Baby let it flow
Just let who you are really show (Really show)
You need to take your time
Play your part with mine
It'll all be fine
Let your troubles go


Party people get your hands up (Yeah)
Get your hands up (Oh)
Party people get your hands up (Get your hands up)
Get your hands up

[Chorus]
I step into another world (Step into another world)
As soon as I start to dance (Out on the floor)
Out on the floor
It's always been the only place (Oh...)
When I'm looking to escape
Baby you can do the same (You can do the same)
Let your troubles go
Baby let it flow
Just let who you are really show (Really show)
You need to take your time
Play your part with mine (Let it flow...)
It'll all be fine
Let your troubles go
