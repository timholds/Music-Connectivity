[Hook]
Yo, you're a good adacdadactor
I laugh and it hurts like a fradatdatcture
You can be the don of this town that town or city on this riddim ill cadatadatcha
I go to the hood and give badacadatcha
Call me a king that’s a fadatadactcha
I ain't no fiend don’t cudatatdatcha
Got my business into that to that to that to that

[Verse 1]
I walk in like who disagrees
I'mma KOG for anybody in the scene
I'mma stay ’03 cos I was bobby with a dream
But now its a reality bob and then I weave
You do grime but stop it when I breath
I go to the gym and I feel like rocky when I leave
Man feel stocky when I leave
Don't won’t ever sound sloppy when I speak
I'm wrecking on the beats
Sour sweet I do the same thing for the whole of the week
Said I ain't King them man have got a cheek
Star in the game me I never had a peak
All I really gotta do is get a bit psycho
Give out the riddims to the DJ’s I know
Then I come back in a couple of months check reports and infos to power like hypo
I should have GREY HAIR the way I work every hour that God sends
I got a gyal from all over odd ends
That’s why I go straight to where the job sends
All over England the top ends
The middle and the bottom won’t stop when
Man step into a brace with the thugs dem
Riddims and producer top ten
Chop dem run up in the place like what then
Them lickle dibby Mic styles man a man already got them
Too man bull in a de pen I gotta stop them
Take pics I don’t like them I crop them
Too pure in the game so when I come across another artist I can’t knock them
If I see a kid who don’t know jack shit
Tell him put down the knife and the Glock them
Ramp or skid on the riddim skate around tracks I cling to the riddim
I wanna sound right on the riddim
Run up on a spitter and light upa riddim
I’m tight on a riddim
Ca man a top flight on a riddim
MC s wanna fight on a riddim
Yeh its what I’m like on the riddim
Man a do it like swoosh Nike on a riddim

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I was always gonna get achievements and I always thought music everday all day
Flew up to aldgate got the blank CDs cheap I’m a traveller
I’m wishing I was stable
Here we go I’m at another dinner table
I’ve come a long way to a plain cheese bagel used to brick lane prick anytime of the week
Now I tell a man
Don’t hype you will get me hyper-per
I was doing this when I was in my dyper-per
Put me in a battle put me in a cypher-pher
Push up uno hand & push up uno lighter-ter ter ter ter ter
Get me hyper per
I wass doing this when I was in my dyper-per
Put me in a battle put me in a cypher
Put me in a battle put me in a cypher-pher

Time traveling I’m hammering it so goodnight sweetheart I’m managing it the time zone and and a this flying off a da chick world class high grade get it off a da strip
