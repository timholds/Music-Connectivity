[Hook X2 : Aston Veyron]

Hate As Much As You Want
T-T-Talk As Much As You Want
Mo-Mo-Money Is What I Want
I Can't See With You With My Dark Shades

[Verse 1 : Aston Veyron]
I Broke Out Of The Game This Is A Manhunt
There Is No End Of Me Like My Wigga Ethan Hunt
And I Like To Fuck Asian! Bang Em Like Owen Hunt
I Always Loved Myself This Is Why I Always Stunt
And I Run This Shit While They Run DMC
Gotta Stay At The Top! Don't Do The TLC
I Make Classic Shit Like I'm With AMC
They Windows Media Player Bitch I'm VLC
Big Numbers Are Coming I'm Gonna Need Charlie Eppes
Haters Are Coming I'm Gonna Need Don Eppes
I Need To Swim In Money Like I'm Michael Phelps
Don't Remember Them Like This Guy Before Michael Phelps

[Verse 2 : Aston Veyron]

All Black Everything I Need A Black Suberban
The More They Hate The Sooner I'm Gonna Need Rubberbands
The More They Hate The Sooner I'm Going To Get A Benz
I Don't Care About The Hate I Want Big Money In My Hands
Crazy Bitch Her Father Must Be Gary Busey
I'll Bang Her Anyway Bad Call Like My Nigga Juicy
They Want Me To Fall Hard! Fall Out Of The Suzi
Bitch I Shoot At Sight SMG The Brand Is UZi
I Got A Crazy View You Would Think That I Work With Whoopi
Sometime I Look Clean Sometime I Look Like My Boy Opie
You Will Never Be Me Maybe A Bad Copy
I'm The US dollar, You Just A Fucking Rupee
