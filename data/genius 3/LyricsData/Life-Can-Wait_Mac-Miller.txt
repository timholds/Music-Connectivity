[Intro]
In the beginning there was only love
Love brought us here today
It was a connection between man and woman that brought us life
Making love
Now I need you to do right now, is close your eyes
Yeah
Ladies and Gentlemen
Especially ladies, you all look so pretty tonight
I introduce myself, my name is Larry Lovestein
And these gentlemen with me are The Velvet Revival
We appreciate your attendance
Sit back and relax, this is You..


I started planning my days all around you
I was waiting around for your call
And I, I heard all the rumors about you, babe
Those things don't bother me at all

I bet you, you look pretty good in a wedding gown
You probably look better with nothing at all
I feel like, know what you're doing, you do it so well
Don't usually do this, I'm fooling myself

I hope you don't mind if I fall
In love, oh
In love, with you
I'm in love, with you, girl, with you
Said I hope you don't mind if I fall

Soon as I kissed you I knew you were right for me
Soon as you woke up in my arms I was yours
Wanna make love to you slow while it's raining, girl
Make love to you while it pours

Girl, when I'm with you life can wait
I'll just kiss you all over your face
Hold you like the world gon' end, girl
I'll do whatever it takes
To be where with you till I die, I want it all

And you're always on my mind
Couldn't stop thinking about you if I try
Just be my baby, let me a lady tonight

I hope you don't mind if I fall
In love, oh
In love, with you
I'm in love, with you, girl, with you
Said I hope you don't mind if I fall
