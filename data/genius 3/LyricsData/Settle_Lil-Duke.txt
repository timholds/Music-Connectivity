[Chorus: Lil Duke]
I will not settle for less, I promise you I'ma make it
Middle fingers to the haters, I got shooters in Decatur
Ever since I got In the league I been balling, and I'm major
Stayed on my grind, and I had to stay patient
Surrounded by bosses, came up with the takers
Now when we all out in public, gave back to the hood and they love me
I don't know him I don't trust him, for check folk gone fuck round and bust him
We on that molly and ecstasy, models they trying get next to me
Baby you mine, and l'm next to be
Thugga my brodie, my bestie (bestie)

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
All we want to do is win win win win win we don't want to lose
I can't claim these bitches cause all em been ran through
And if we want it we buy it nigga
Young nigga riding and they die with me
I'm all out of town never in the city
Whenever I land I got plenty bitches
I got some OGs and they rooting for me
Whipping them babies no cruelty
They look up to me I'm influencing
Love the whole time ain't no breaking I don't trust it
I don't want to talk if you ain't talking about money
Christian lou how my bitch coming
Need a money counter cause the money keep coming
Drag race I pulled up in a 488 rari
I been balling that's my hobby
She geeked on the molly fell asleep in the lobby
Way before rap bitch I been popping
I took your bitch could have kidnapped her
Never mind nigga slash that
Give me mine where the cash at

[Chorus: Lil Duke]
I will not settle for less, I promise you I'ma make it
Middle fingers to the haters, I got shooters in Decatur
Ever since I got In the league I been balling, and I'm major
Stayed on my grind, and I had to stay patient
Surrounded by bosses, came up with the takers
Now when we all out in public, gave back to the hood and they love me
I don't know him I don't trust him, for check folk gone fuck round and bust him
We on that molly and ecstasy, models they trying get next to me
Baby you mine, and l'm next to be
Thugga my brodie, my bestie (bestie)
