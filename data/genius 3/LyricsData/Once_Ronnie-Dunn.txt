[Verse 1]
You were a wait, so worth the price of all the hurt inside me
Just when the sun was setting on my heart
You found a way to drown the loneliness and doubt inside me
Just when my soul was getting used to the dark, here you are

[Chorus]
Of all the roads that wind and curve, the shoots you downs, the twists and turns
Somehow, we found our way
Let's hold each other, fight for this... life, you know it's all we get, baby
You only find this kind of love once

[Verse 2]
You're like a song that finds its way inside, I can't quit singin'
A one of a kind timeless melody
The past just doesn't matter anymore so let's just leave it
Forever with you is all I ever need, I can't believe

[Chorus]
Of all the roads that wind and curve, the shoots you downs, the twists and turns
Somehow, we found our way
Let's hold each other, fight for this... life, you know it's all we get, baby
You only find this kind of love once

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Of all the roads that wind and curve, the shoots you downs, the twists and turns
Somehow, we found our way
Let's hold each other, fight for this, life, you know it's all we get, baby
You only find this kind of love... this kind of love... once
