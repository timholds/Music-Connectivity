[** from "Country Strong" soundtrack:]
I've seen men look at before*
And they think, I don't see them
I'd like to think it makes me proud
But, I'm only.. fooling me
I know she'll be lookin' back
The minute I'm not there
While she pours herself on some stranger
I pour myself a drink somewhere
She's acting single
I'm drinking double
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking
Like the tiny bubbles
She's acting single
I'm drinking doubles
I know all she plans to do
But I don't know where or when
If I ask who that stranger was
She'll just say, "an old friend"
I'm not weak, I tell myself
I stay because I'm strong
The truth is, I'm not man enough
To stop her from doing me wrong
She's acting single
I'm drinking doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
My heart is breaking
Like the tiny bubbles
She's acting single
I'm drinking doubles
She's acting single
I'm drinking doubles
I hide my pain
I drown my troubles
