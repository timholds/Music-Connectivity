[Intro]
Won’t somebody rescue me?
Ooh, set me free
From my heavy head
Oh, from my heavy head

[Verse 1]
No, it wasn't meant to be this way
But I’m stronger now than yesterday
And the rain is pouring down my face
But I'll live to find a better way

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You can spread your wings
Turn the truth to lies
But the road is long to the open sky
Let the sun shine down over you and I
Let the storm arise 'cause we fall and fly

[Chorus]
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue me?
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue me?

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and take this pain away
Only fools believe that luck will stay
And the road is paved with guilt and shame
But the light will lead you on the same

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You can chase it all 'til your veins run dry
You can live to wake, you can breathe to die
Let the sun shine down over you and I
Let the storm arise 'cause we fall and fly

[Bridge]
Won't somebody rescue me?
Ooh, set me free
From my heavy head
Oh, from my heavy head
Won't somebody rescue me?
Ooh, set me free
From my heavy head
Oh, from my heavy head

[Chorus]
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue me?
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue me?
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue me?
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue
Won't somebody rescue me?
