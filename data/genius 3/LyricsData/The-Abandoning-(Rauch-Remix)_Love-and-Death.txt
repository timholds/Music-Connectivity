Wake up, sleepy, wide awake

I am the walking dead, I am death's best friend
I create disaster, I'm the master killing me
There's no innocence, there's only pain, I'm empty

Master, Master, save me
Master, Master, kill me
Don't give up on me now, 'cause that's what I've already done
My body's breaking down, I feel my mind getting numb

Why do I hurt myself?
Why can't I escape this Hell?
I am always blaming, always chasing broken dreams
I keep screaming out, but no one ever hears me

Master, Master, save me
Master, Master, kill me
Don't give up on me now, 'cause that's what I've already done
My body's breaking down, I feel my mind getting numb
Bleeding from my disconnection, lost inside myself
Forsaken by my own reflection, abandoning myself

I'm wide awake
(On myself)
I'm wide awake
(Give up, give up on myself)
(Give up, give up)
I'm wide awake, save me

Master, Master, save me
Master, Master, kill me
Don't give up on me now, 'cause that's what I've already done
My body's breaking down, I feel my mind getting numb
Bleeding from my disconnection, lost inside myself
Forsaken by my own reflection, abandoning myself

No, I'm wide awake
