Part I

[Verse 1]
Born into Nixon, I was raised in hell
A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
The last one born and the first one to run
My town was blind from refinery sun

[Pre-Chorus]
My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

[Chorus]
21st century breakdown
I once was lost but never was found
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline

[Verse 2]
I was made of poison and blood
Condemnation is what I understood
Video games of the tower's fall
Homeland security could kill us all

[Pre-Chorus]
My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

[Chorus]
21st century breakdown
I once was lost but never was found
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline

[Bridge]

Part II

[Intro]
We are the class of, the class of '13
Born in the year of humility
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969

[Verse 1]
My name is no one, the long lost son
Born on the 4th of July
Raised in the era of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive
I am a nation, a worker of pride
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands are a means to an end
It's all I have to show

[Verse 2]
I swallowed my pride and I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
I've broken my fingers and lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control
I've been to the edge and I've thrown the bouquet
Of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room wasting my time
And waiting for judgement day

[Bridge]
I praise liberty
"The Freedom to Obey,"
It's the song that strangles me
Well, don't cross the line

Part III

[Outro]
Oh, dream, America, dream
I can't even sleep from the light's early dawn
Oh, scream, America, scream
Believe what you see from heroes and cons
