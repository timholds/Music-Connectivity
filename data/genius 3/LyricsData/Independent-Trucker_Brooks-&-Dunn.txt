Well my daddy was a world class trucker, took my momma on a four day trip
And she swears to me that I was conceived at a big rig dealership
The story goes on the day I was born
He hit the road and he never looked back
Well my daddy went and named me a big mistake
But my momma always called me Mack

And I'm a haulin', chug-a-luggin through the rain and snow
Yeah I'm a haulin', I put the hammer down and let it roll
My babies callin, sayin' baby when ya gonna come home
Well I'm an independent trucker... a mother lovin'
Overloaded owner operator just a tearin' up a two lane road

I got the chrome girls on my mudflaps
I keep a cup o' coffee on the dashboard
Got a custom airbrush desert scene and my name painted on the door
Got a cross of jesus all along the grille, lights up like a christmas tree
Any highway, any time of day, thats where I wanna be

Well I'm a haulin', only 700 miles to go
Yeah I'm a haulin', I put the hammer down and let it roll
My babies callin', sayin' baby when ya gonna come home
Well I'm an independent trucker... a mother lovin
Overloaded owner operator just a tearin' up a two lane road
