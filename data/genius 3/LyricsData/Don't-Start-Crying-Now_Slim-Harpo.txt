You ain't never had to cry, baby
Don't start cryin', now
You ain't never had to cry, baby
Don't start cryin', now
You ain't never loved me, baby
Didn't mean me no good, no how

Well, the man you got, baby
He don't mean you no good
Well, the man you got, baby
He don't mean you no good
He's just breakin' you down
An in yo' neighborhood

Well, cry-cry, baby
You can cry here all night long
You can cry-cry, baby
Cry-cry, all night long
But when you wake up in the morn'
You gonna find your good man gone

Whoa-oh, yes you will!

You been braggin' about your woman
Take one look at mine
You been braggin' about your woman
Take one look at mine
She's just as sweet as any angel
Wanna love her most all the time
