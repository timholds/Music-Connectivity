If you say so
Nothing's wrong with you
I haven't been so
Down since that time that I
Did too
If you say so (say so)
We're all out as one
Until I go home, so hard
That heart has just
Begun
Want to get in so deep, oh
No
I should like to be
Through
Do you want to, want to
Do you want to, want to
Do you want to
If you say so
Kemp is Antichrist
I haven't been so, I haven't
Been so
I haven't been so, I haven't
Been so
If you say so (say so)
We're all out as one
Until I go home, so hard
That heart is just....
Wanna get in so deep, oh
No
I would like to be through (I would
Like to be through)
So
Do you want to, want to
Do you want to, want to
Do you want to
