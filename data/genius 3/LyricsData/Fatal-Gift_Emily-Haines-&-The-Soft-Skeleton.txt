[Verse 1]
Haven’t we made
Enough for a living wage?
We accept the fatal gift
A soup stone for our stove
And a blindfold for our tears
Paying for a living wage
Know it’s a deceptive deal
We accept the fatal gift
They hover over where we live

[Hook]
The things you own, they own you

[Verse 2]
Haven’t we saved
Enough to go away
Enough to reach the coast?
Why do we stay
Paying for a living wage?
I know it’s a deceptive deal
We accept the fatal gift
They hover over where we live

[Hook]
All the things you own, they own you
The things you own, they own you

[Bridge]
And you own it and it owns you [x8]

And you own it and it owns you [x6]
(All the things you own, they own you)
And you own it and it owns you

And you own it and it owns you [x5]
(The things you own, they own you)
And you own it and it owns you [x3]

And you own it and it owns you
[x4]

[Verse 3]
Close my eyes
Close my eyes

[Hook]
The things you own, they own you
All the things you own, they own you

[Bridge]
And you own it and it owns you [x8]

And you own it and it owns you
[x8]

And you own it and it owns you [x5]
(All the things you own, they own you)
And you own it and it owns you [x3]

And you own it and it owns you [x5]
(The things you own, they own you)
And you own it and it owns you
And you own it and it owns you
(All the things you own, they own you)
And you own it

The things you own, they own you
The things you own, they own you

And you own it and it owns you [x20]
