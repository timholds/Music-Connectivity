[Verse 1]
If these walls came crumbling down
Fell so hard to make us lose our faith
From what's left you'd figure it out
Still make lemonade taste like a sunny day

[Chorus 1]
Stay beautiful baby
I hope you stay American baby
American baby

[Verse 2]
Nobody's laughing now
God's grace lost and the devil is proud
But I've been walking for a thousand miles
If for one last time I could see you smile

[Chorus 2]
I, I hold, hold on to you
You bring me hope I'll see you soon
And if I don't see you, oh
I'm afraid we've lost the way

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
I hold on to you
You lift me up and always will
I see you in light
Hope I don't get left behind

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 1][x2]

[Outro]
Stay
American baby
Beautiful baby
Nobody's laughing now
But you could always make me laugh out loud
Stay
American baby
American baby
Stay
American baby
American baby
