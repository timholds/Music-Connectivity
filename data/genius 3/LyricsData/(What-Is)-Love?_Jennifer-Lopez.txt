[Intro]
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na

[Verse 1]
People told me I should write a love song
"Girl you sound so angry, you could use some variation"
But I'm lonely, negative relations
I've been hurt so many times
I don't have the patience

[Pre-Chorus]
But I've wished for so long
For someone to come and show me, lead by example
Cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age, I'm so tired of the game
I wanna be somebody's girl
Would you show me the way?

[Chorus]
What if I never find, and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same, status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Cause if you told me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely (What is love?)
Please, show me

[Verse 2]
I've had blind dates
Hooked up with some real flakes
I've gone out with church boys
Musician's are the worst
I've tried so hard, cause I'm just so die hard
Tried my best to play the part
Wish you could see inside

[Pre-Chorus]
But I've wished for so long
For someone to come and show me, lead by example
Cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age, I'm so tired of the game
I wanna be somebody's girl
Would you show me the way?

[Chorus]
What if I never find, and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same, status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Cause if you told me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely (What is love?)
Please, show me

[Interlude]
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
(What is love?)
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na

[Bridge]
I've been alone for the past three years on Valentine's Day
Christmas is no exception, birthday's with naughty presents
Been back and forth, same action
I just need this to happen
I'll be singing love's praises, if you would show me

[Chorus]
What if I never find, and I'm left behind?
Should I keep hoping for love?
What if I'm still the same, status doesn't change?
Gotta keep hoping for love
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Somebody show me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Cause if you told me
What is love? What is love? What is love?
I wouldn't be lonely (What is love?)
Please, show me

[Outro]
What is love? What is love? What is love?
What is love? What is love? What is love?
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
