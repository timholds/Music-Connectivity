"places you will never know"

And now snow does fall where Strindberg walked and lived
So much has been out of reach but behind the sun is another one

Speak of what shines bright tonight but not tomorrow
It is good that I don't find words, words destroy the lonely things

The gods I worship are inside
Is this the last song of my life
I have wasted so much time
And the starry sky above

The lonely have no right to share the summer sun
Let's stay inside and do nothing, this is it, my suicide queen

The reek of flesh sickens me now, the past betrays
A decision my body has made, this wave crashes above my head

The gods I worship are inside
Is this the last song of my life
I have wasted so much time
And the black sky inside

I have wasted so much time

The gods I worship are inside
Is this the last song of my life
I have wasted so much time
My ocean is shipless

There is no road
You make your path as you walk
