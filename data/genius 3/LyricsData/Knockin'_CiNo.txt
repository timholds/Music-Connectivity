[Verse 1]
I make the club bounce like it's filled with hydraulics
I got so many bars, you would think I'm alcoholic
Don't bother me, I'm a problem
Because if this Hip-Hop's a game
I'm the referee, just watch me call it
I'll beat the insides out of him
Cuz I'm out of control
Don't be doubting me or I'mma just blow
I got it out of me cuz I am not allowed to be
The blasphemy and loud-speaking, outlawing fast MC
A lot of energy coming from this Hennessy
Puns in my artillery, gunning all my enemies
What the fuck you telling me?
Chlorophyll and celery?
How the fuck you making green by going out and selling trees?
Makes no sense to me
I just keep on rhyming words and finding verbs
To line the verse
Inclined to curse, man I'm the worst!
I mean I'm the baddest, B
It is not a fallacy
I got these haters mad at me
Cuz I'm climbing up the mountain peak

[Hook]
I'm knockin'
Open up the door
Beat's knockin'
Shaking up the floor
You bouncin'
Going out of control
Cuz the DJ know how to get you low
I'm knockin'
Open up the door
Beat's knockin'
Shaking up the floor
You bouncin'
Going out of control
This the place to go when y'all wanna roll

[Verse 2]
This beat is so hot that I'm jumping up on it
Like a fucking trampoline, spitting fast like Sonic
I'm CiNo cuz I keep it 100, but we know that
I know that my name's so fucking ironic
Niggas getting mad cuz I'm counting like a calculator
So many zeroes, I malfunctioned and went out of data
Eating so much pussy, mouth wide like an alligator
Yeah, I'm a killer, out a hater like Terminator
Suffocating traitors 'till they out of respiration
And if I don't kill 'em, I'll teach 'em a lesson like domestication
Then I'm drinking 151, celebration
Smoking on that Chronic, getting high, elevation
Budapest, Budapest
Tell me (tell me), who the best?
Eminem, Ludacris
But y'all forget the newer Chris!
I'm hitting up your Top 5
Cuz I'm coming to the rescue
If you don't mention me, I swear I'mma put you to rest

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm a bad boy, wild boy, fuck MGK, though
He's faker than Gucci shades made out of playdough
I'm spitting that raw, boy
Hot as a live wire
Watch mama drop it, then Waka Waka and got quite NASTY
I gi-get it, gi-get it, don't ask me
It's Ashley, Jackie
That bad bitch in my backseat
I'm spitting faster than a fucking track meet
Cuz CiNo on the way to be the only primary athlete
So much to say, so little time
Been rapping for years, this my moment to shine
(HEY!) Dope with the rhymes
(OH!) One of a kind
Put on a show, take off the blinds
This year I'mma grow, stay on my grind
You already know these niggas be lyin'
But I'm like a school note, I gotta be signed!

[Hook]

[Outro]
CiNo, TFE
Get used to us
We unstoppable
