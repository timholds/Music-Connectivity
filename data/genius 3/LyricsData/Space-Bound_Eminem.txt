[Verse 1]
We touch, I feel a rush; we clutch, it isn't much
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us
It's lust, it's torturous, you must be a sorceress
'Cause you just did the impossible: gained my trust
Don't play games, it'll be dangerous
If you fuck me over, ‘cause if I get burnt, I'ma show ya
What it's like to hurt, ‘cause I been treated like dirt before ya
And love is evil — spell it backwards, I'll show ya
Nobody knows me, I'm cold
Walk down this road all alone
It's no one's fault but my own
It's the path I've chosen to go
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion whatsoever so
Don't ask me why I have no love for these muh'fuckin' hoes
Bloodsuckin' succubuses
What the fuck is up with this?
I've tried in this department, but I ain't had no luck with this
It sucks, but it's exactly what I thought it would be
Like tryin' to start over
I got a hole in my heart, but some kinda emotional roller coaster
Something I won't go on
So you toy with my emotions, ho, it's over
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya
Wasn't joking when I told ya
You take my breath away, you're a supernova, and I'm a—

[Hook]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 2]
I'll do whatever it takes
When I'm with you I get the shakes
My body aches when I ain't with you, I have zero strength
There's no limit on how far I would go
No boundaries, no lengths
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's
Gonna be that one, then once we get 'em it's never the same
You want them when they don't want you
Soon as they do, feelings change
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate
I wasn't lookin' when I stumbled on to you, musta been fate
But so much is at stake
What the fuck does it take? Let's cut to the chase
'Fore the door shuts in your face
Promise me if I cave in and break and leave myself open
That I won't be makin' a mistake, ‘cause I'm a—

[Hook]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm aiming right at you
Right at you, right at you

[Verse 3]
So, after a year and six months
It's no longer me that you want
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once
I poured my heart out to you
Let down my guard, swear to God
I blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin'
I'm tryna stop you from leavin'
You won't even listen, so fuck it, I'm tryna stop you from breathin'
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin'
'Til I snap your neck like a Popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live
Tears stream down both of my cheeks
Now I let you go and just give
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple, I told you this:

[Bridge]
And I would've did anything for you
To show you how much I adored you
But it's over now, it's too late to save our love
Just promise me you'll think of me every time
You look up in the sky and see a star, ‘cause I'm a—

[Outro]
I'm a space-bound rocket ship
And your heart's the Moon
And I'm aiming right at you, right at you
250,000 miles on a clear night in June
And I'm so lost without you
Without you, without you
