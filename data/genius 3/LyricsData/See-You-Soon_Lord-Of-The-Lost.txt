[Strophe 1]
I don't wanna see and I don't wanna hear
The shadow of the arriving bat
Please don't release me when you see me falling
Into the moaning grounds of death

[Bridge 1]
I will disband my heart in your hand

[Chorus 1]
Will you tell me - See you soon in a while
When my eyes fade, please give me your smile
And even dark nights are ending in dawn
You'll have time to cry when I'm gone

[Strophe 2]
Devour me and fill my heart with courage
Give me wings and camouflage the scar
Rip out my lungs and kill my fever
Bring me back to the alluring grounds of love

[Bridge 1]

[Chorus 2]
Will you tell me - See you soon in a while
When my eyes fade, please give me your smile
And even dark nights are ending in dawn
You'll have time to cry when I'm gone
This is not farewell, this is only goodbye
When my lips fade, please kiss them good night
But even bright days are starting in dawn
You'll have time to cry when I'm gone

[Bridge 2]
All the happy faces and memories are killing me
Am I already dreaming
Please tell me that I only sleep

[Strophe 3]
Close the circle, come to an end
Metamorphosis begins
Please hold your problems and let me forsake
Metanoia and the laughing grounds of hate

[Chorus 2 (x2)]

You'll have time to cry when I'm gone
You'll have time to cry when I'm gone
