[Verse 1]
There's a long line of cars
The parking lot's full of people already crying
It's the hottest day in seven years
And I ain't the only one here dying
Well, I wish I had a cigarette or one more shot of jack
But you can't go back
When the church bell rings
Baby, let's do this thing

[Verse 2]
My first grade teacher never liked me
Who sent her an invitation?
I got second cousins rolling in like momma's got supper waiting
And the sherriff's on the front row
Yeah just to see me settlin' down
Wait until he finds out you're crazy as me
Baby, let's do this thing

[Chorus]
Cause I'm dressed, you're stressed
There's a church full of guests
And who turned on the heat
My collar's kinda tight
Your face is kinda white
Girl, don't you pass out on me
Cause if we can make it through just two I do's
We'll be off on a life-long dream
I got the limo and the preacher
And your little baby sister's got the pillow and the wedding rings
Let's do this thing
Let's do this thing

[Verse 3]
I got the snorkle and the flip flops
Take you to the hot spot
Didn't pack a stitch of clothes
I'll be glad when this thing's over
Like some ringling brothers show
And I know I wasn't supposed to see you
'Fore I saw you walking down the aisle
And it's going to sound wild
But don't dress up for me, yeah
Baby, let's do this thing

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah your momma won't cry forever
She'll think it's funny some day
She gave you away in a veil and jeans
Baby, let's do this thing
Let's do this thing
Let's do this thing
Come on
