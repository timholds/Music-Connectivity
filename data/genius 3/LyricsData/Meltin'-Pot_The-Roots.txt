Alright, 100 grand says I get it in one take
She want to know if we can be together
Even if it ain't gonna be forever
But it can only be for one night
The only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic
She want to know if we can be together
Even if it ain't gonna be forever
But it can only be for one night
The only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic
Trust me, it's something 'bout the way I touch her
The way that I hold her, the way I clutch her
She move a lot but that ain't shit to me
I need that bitch and that bitch needs me
She want to know if we can be together
Even if it ain't gonna be forever
But it can only be for one night
The only thing I ever loved in my life was the mic
