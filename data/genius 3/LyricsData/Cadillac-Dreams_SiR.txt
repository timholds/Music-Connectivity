[Verse 1: SiR]
You're next to me, oh
I swear it's true
Can't no one tell
It's you and me
Just driving slow
The windows low, so we can feel the breeze, baby

[Hook: SiR]
When I close my eyes, you're by my side
With the chocolate skin, the dark hair and those brown eyes
I see you in my Cadillac dreams
I made up my mind
By the end of the night, I'mma see you in my Cadillac dreams
Oh, you're all I need
I do believe that you're the one I see

[Verse 2: SiR]
No destination, no expectations
We're keeping it unofficial
But we're rolling
Somehow you got me open
With words that were never spoken
But I know I hear you, baby

[Hook]
When I close my eyes, you're by my side
With that chocolate skin, that dark hair and those brown eyes
I see you in my Cadillac dreams
Oh, I made up my mind
By the end of the night, I'mma see you in my Cadillac dreams
Oh, you're all I need
I do believe that you're the one I see

[Hook 2]
You're in my Cadillac, Cadillac
My Cadillac, Cadillac
You're in my Cadillac, Cadillac
My Cadillac, Cadillac
You're in my Cadillac, Cadillac
My Cadillac, Cadillac

[Verse 3: Big KRIT]
Cadillac-lac,  you got a diamond in the front and the back
When the sun shines through it I lose it
I was wood grain gripping on, double-cup sipping on
Tell me how you really want it
Shawty what's your speed?
Zero to sixty, one finger whipping a figure eighty
Sub boom bassin', let's go half on a baby
Twelve playin, rim scraping while I'm bending out your corners
Shifting all your gears, toying with your motor, oil you up
You shine when you strut
Pressing on your pedal till we wake the neighbors up
You my chrome grilled woman, trunk poppin' on the daily
When your lights shining, tight blinding, drive these hoes crazy
I knew it from the start when you took your frame apart
Filled you up, tuned you up, revved you till you start
We on the road, you motivated, you overheat
I know just how to fix it, don't you ever break with me
My Cadillac dream

[Verse 4: SiR]
Cadillac dreams, oh
I made up my mind
By the end of the night, I'mma see you in my Cadillac dreams
Whoa, you're all I need
I do believe that you're the one I see

[Hook 2]
You're in my Cadillac, Cadillac
My Cadillac, Cadillac
You're in my Cadillac, Cadillac
My Cadillac, Cadillac
You're in my Cadillac, Cadillac
My Cadillac, Cadillac
