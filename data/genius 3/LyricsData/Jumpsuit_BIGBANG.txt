Now here's a story from
Back in the day
A true story about a drunk
And a babe
It unfolded right in front of us
Rush hour number 20 bus
This gorgeous woman
With curious hair
Cold stare nose in the air
Arms folded across her chest
We could tell she was
Dressed for success
Fancy shoes
Expensive purse
This girl thinks she's going
Places
Drunk got on talking aloud
Broke the tension
Working the crowd
We were amused this guy was fun
Eyeing the babe and rambling on
While she pretended not to care
Cold stare nose in the air
But we could all sense
She was still enjoying
Those compliments
You got great legs
Got them cheekbones baby
But what the hell you do
To your hair
