[Hook: Big KRIT]
I'm going live, from the underground
From the underground

[Verse 1: Big KRIT & Ms. Linnie]
And I'm gone
Just be strong
You're not alone (You're not alone)
I'm going home (I'm going home)
Carry on (carry on)
Carry on (carry on)
Carry on (carry on)
Carry on (carry on)

[Hook: Big KRIT]

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
Yea I know it's hard
This world will let you down one day (down one day)
Just let down your guard
I'll pick you up if you're 'round my way (if you're 'round my way)
Call my name
Free your chains
Call my name
Free your chains

[Bridge]
I got to get a move on

[Verse 3]
They say the train still coming, it won't be long
Only the good Lord knows my wrongs
Trouble is the damn devil won't leave me alone
No time to waste, I gotta pay my dues
Lord, my problems seem to come in twos
All these miles I walk, they can't fill my shoes

[Hook: Big KRIT & Ms. Linnie]
