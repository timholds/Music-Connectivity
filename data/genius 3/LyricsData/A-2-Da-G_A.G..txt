Andre the Giant
It's the A to the G, the A to the G
The A to the G, A - A.G
It's the A to the G, the A to the G
The A to the G, it's the A

[A.G.]
Well it's the bone crusher, plus-a, known hustler
I'll be, on your block, with the ruckus
Tear the club up, just from spittin shit
G.D. the sickest click, strictly on some different shit
I'm the same on the train or with the whip
We get the DJ open and watch you witness it
Now peep how hype the chickens and niggas get
Blew your mind when it's time for the remix, flip my shit

[Hook: repeat 2X]
... roll that ... light that ... smoke that
... this track ... is fat ... light that

[A.G.]
Back to the drawin board, I'm talkin to alla y'all
This the dirt they were callin for
Back 'em in, pack 'em in from wall to wall
You wanna brawl or ball I won't fall at all
Spit, more than y'all, and my flows killin
And I'm +Cold Chillin'+ like Marley Marl
Youse a funny dude like Pauly Shore
Test A.G. and get what'cha hand is callin for
Get dirty, and

[Hook]

[Interlude]
It's the A to the G, the A to the G
The A to the G, A - A.G
A to the G, the A to the G
It's the A to the G, Andre the Giant

[A.G.]
Yo the bombay's the finest, John Blaze with minors
You really wanna wrestle with Andre the Giant?
I probably hit you with a track on consignment
Now hold up, I throw up raps, like vomit
Shit, so what? If there's a best then I'm it
Time to blow up, hit the globe like a comet
Words from a master poet
Niggas drank all the Crist', so pass the Moet
And me no blow no such thing (why not)
I'm in the 9-9 Mustang, doin my thug thang

[Outro Hook]
... roll that ... light that ... smoke that
... this track ... is fat ... light that
... roll that ... light that ... smoke that
... this track ... is fat ... fuck that

[Ad libs to fade]
