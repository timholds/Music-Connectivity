Ahh, watch me from the back
Ahh, watch me from the back
Just take a good look

You can call me a fool you can call me crazy
You can call me anything you want to sweet baby
You can call me wrong but honey call me gone oh oh oh
You can call out my name you can call my number
But by that time Miss Patti just might have another
You can call all night long but mm call me gone oh oh
I'm not gonna play in your game any longer

And I'm not gonna hear one more lie one more time no
You were the one who lifted me up just to let me down
Why should I stay around? Why? Say
Call me call me call me gone
Call me call me call me gone
Hey you can call it a phase just a phase I'm going through
You can say anything you want
But I'm afraid of you you can call it what you want
But ooh sweet thing call me gone oh oh

I'm not gonna play in your game any longer
I'm not gonna hear one more lie one more time no no no ooh oh
You were the one who lifted me up just to let me down
Why should I stay around?
I don't think so
Call me call me call me gone
Call me call me call me gone
Ah ah ah ah

I'm not gonna play in your game any longer
I'm not gonna hear one more lie one more time huh say no
Just to let me down
I'm not gonna stay around
You can call me a fool you can call me crazy
You can call me anything you want to sweet baby
You can call me wrong but just remember to call me gone
I'll bet you'll never forget that will ya?

Call me call me call me gone
Call me call me call me gone

Call me call me call me gone
Call me call me call me gone
Call me call me call me gone
