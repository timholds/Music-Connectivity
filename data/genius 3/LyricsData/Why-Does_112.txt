(Daron)
All the love you've given me
So special seems to be no limit
I'll do anything
There's no boundaries to how we can grow
How can I let you know
Girl, let me sit and think, oh

1 - Why does the wind blow
Why does the sun shine
Why does the rainfall down on my face
Why does the earth spin
Why do the waters reach the shore
And tell me, tell me why
Why do I love you like I do

(Mike)
Oh, in the past
You were there when I was down
My friends could not be found
Your touch kept me so strong
But our love didn't fade away
Instead it sails inside the sky
That's why I must ask why
I must ask why

Repeat 1

(Slim)
I ask myself the question time and time again
(Baby I love you)
Baby I love you
(Yes I do)
Why did you have to hurt me
And leave me all alone
(Baby I love you)
Oh, baby I love you
Now I'm all alone when I need your love

Repeat 1 until fade
