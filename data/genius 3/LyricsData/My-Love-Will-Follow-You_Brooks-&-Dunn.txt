[Versa 1]
Take your suitcase and take your heart
Take a train to the dark
My love will follow you
My love will follow you
You can try to lose yourself downtown
You can burn all your bridges down
My love will follow you
Oh my love will follow you

[Chorus]
My love will follow you
Down every highway of your soul
You can leave me far behind
My love will be your shadow
Everywhere you go

[Versa 2]
So close the door
Turn in the key
Leave me here like a memory
My love will follow you
Oh my love will follow you
Even on the road that takes you down
Where the cords of human kindness come unwound
My love will follow you
Oh my love will follow you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If you should ever go so far
That you cannot get back
You may not remember
But my heart will not lose track

[Chorus][x2]
