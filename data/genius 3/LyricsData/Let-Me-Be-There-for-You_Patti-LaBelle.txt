We stood on an island of our own
From the moment we first met
And we will forever
So seldom found ; A privilege to hold
Like a precious stone
That I will always treasure
In my mind I picture you
And thought you're far away
It's like you're right here with me everyday
Let me be there for you
Let me be there for you
Whenever you need a friend
Please think of me
No matter what you go through
There's someone you can trun to
Whenever you need a friend who cares
Let me be there
You think you've got a friend and then you see
When your eyes are closed
They're out to deceive
No need to wonder when it comes to me
By now, You should know
I'm the one you can believe
In this game of life we play
You can't always win
And when you look for refuge
Take my hand
Let me be there for you
Let me be there for you
Whenever you need a friend
Please think of me
No matter what you go through
There's someone you can turn to
Whenever you need a friend who cares
Let me be there
