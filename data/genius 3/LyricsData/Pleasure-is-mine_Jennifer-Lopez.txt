[Verse 1]
Baby relax, we've been waiting for this
And we deserve the heavenly bliss
That waits underneath the stars above
Can't you hear them begging us, "Let's make love"
From the bottom of my heart I give you my soul
Right here in this room the truth unfold
Is saying, stop playing, delaying the divine

[Chorus]
The pleasure is mine, let me give some to you
We can take our time, nothing I'd rather do
To make you feel fine, to make your life shine
Give you moments you can treasure forever
Remember the pleasure is mine, mine, mine, all mine

[Verse 2]
Everyday I've been dreaming about how
It's going to be to find you out
To be sharing your kiss, to be just like this
What I wouldn't do for a taste of your lips
So let's not waste one second more
Let's cut the lights and let's lock the door
Is saying, stop playing, delaying the divine

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh baby, I don't want to breathe
Don't want to change a single vibe
Nobody else I rather see
When you're like this before my eyes
Want to be everything you need
Keep you satisfied, I'm praying, stop playing
Is saying, stop playing, ah, ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]

[Outro] [x3]
The pleasure is mine, let me give some to you
We can take our time, nothing I'd rather do
