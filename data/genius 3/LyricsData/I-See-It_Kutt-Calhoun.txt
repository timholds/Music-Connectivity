[Intro]
Somebody tell me what the fuck's goin on with these niggas out here man? I ain't  understand it you know what I'm sayin? I'm the king of the city, nigga, man, you know what I'm sayin? Straight from Killa City, man. And what niggas do around here, man. They keep to theyself. But I see these niggas, man. The way they look at me when I roll, they sideways frowns & shit, man. And I just wanna let you bitch-ass niggas know; I see you niggas, man

[Verse 1]
You see me roll in the Chevy, know that I'm doing it heavy
Your body language will tell me nigga, I see you nigga
The fedi kicks and the belvi the skinny jeans and the smelly
When I walk past is making you wanna be me nigga
But I ain't mad, matter fact impressed
A hatin campain I ain't know I had one yet
That was the same thing I was just asking Tech
He told me niggas get mad at established vets
They wanna steal your swagger, and kill your laughter
Stick every nigga who get rich and you with daggers
Will smile up in your face, but then will boo you after
It's all the same, part of the game when you's a factor
So niggas keep on feeding me all the fuel to gas up
My passion, I'm blasting right to and past ya
And you won't have to worry bout the ruins after
Cause Kutty Cals will show ya, who? The master

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne & Kutt Calhoun]
Yo, You muggin hard on the low
I see it
The way you look at my car when I roll
I See it
Even with my Sucka Duckas on
I see it
You hatin on me
I see it
Quit fakin homie
I see it

[Verse 2]
My bank account large, your bank account small
But fresh as I'm raw, niggas y'all spoiled
I tour across all 50 states, y'all
Home with no job, scratching your balls (kids)
You muthafuckas are bout to witness
One of the baddest niggas up out of middle Kansas City
I do it mane
I got the right to be cocky
Pac and The Biggie gave me a vision
You must've done missed it , you better school mane
R-r-rollin', I'm stayin' making kid while you're playin'
I'm just s-s-sing my man, you better get up on it
P-p-pause on playin' soaked on globally and I'm choke up the doe on fam
When I put the milion on it (whatever)
Cause this word is disturbed, you just heard
It get's worse, you disperse and get murder
Predict fall, your lips sore can get sorbed
Can't this heard, just shit yours, you get farsh

[Hook x2: Tech N9ne & Kutt Calhoun]

[Verse 3]
Boom shaka-laka, soo-woo walkin' in two suckas
Move on your partner, come through, blacka of two marakas
You got a problem the dues problem, see you about it
You with the top, we shoot the blocka, but then we out it
It ain't even gotta be this way
Niggas start lotta beef these days
Never wonder in the streets in-play
Cause off the porch it's a different game
Pistols and pillies and mack, millies for niggas who wack
Silly and hate on the fact, niggas is gettin' the cash
Come up to me with that jazz, I'mma be ready to blap
Famers like Trav Walker get hit from the start with a strap
So I hope you got a clear understand, who'se in demand
That you ain't too damned, you're lucky to see
Cause I don't wanna have to ruin your plans to be
All because nigga with no love was fucking with me
