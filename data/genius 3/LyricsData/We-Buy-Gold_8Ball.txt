[Hook: Big KRIT]

Nigga we buy gold, wires and vogues
Slamming my doors, knockin' these hoes
And when I'm feeling like I'm feeling like I'm feeling today
I put my smoke in the wind and dump the guts in the tray
Swanky slow when I ride everyday when I ball
Been official with mine, I ain't fuckin' with y'all
Plus these hoes ain't no love, put that there on my sub
Give a fuck what it is or what it was
We buy gold

[Verse 1: 8Ball]

In my mouth, where I'm from that's common
Al Green and Marvin Gaye music called pimpin'
Here's another testament, ignorant or elegant
Roar like a elephant, time to take my medicine
Inhale a large amount, hold it, blow it out my nose
Gasoline you can smell it on my clothes
Trampoline, bounce around and get some bread
Magazine's top model give a pimp some head
She is not complaining, we paper planin'
We got the top down and the music banging
Clip full of hollow tips, tipping through the back streets
Personal protection, pimpin', right under the front seat
Pull it out and use it if I feel my life in jeopardy
On the beach in Rio with some bitch is where I'd rather be
We paper planin', they not complainin'
Cuz they with big Ball

[Repeat Hook]

[Verse 2: MJG]

I'm a twenty-four carat, gon' let you have it
If you really want it, type of nigga pull a rabbit out a hat
In a minute, Chevy thang tinted
When I ride through my city, people still know who in it
Make shit look better even if I ain't up in it
Got the shine on my tires and them blunt killas in it
It's a ? game but I still shoot to win it
I'm pimp tight, M-J-G
I'm vintage, I'm classy
That means I been through it and lasted
Now I spot bullshit a mile away and pass it
Tried steppin' in it but the shit got shittier
So I got smarter, my wits got wittier
My heart been broken, I just picked it up and glued it back
That was way back, way back, before I knew the facts
Spittin' what I know, not the he-she said shit
And I'm still comin' out hard like a red brick

[Repeat Hook]
