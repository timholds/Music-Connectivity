(Destiny's Child remix)
You so, you so nasty girl
Nasty, nasty, nasty nasty, nasty girl
Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without your clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' 'bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want no hot female that's been around
The block female, you nasty girl
Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without your clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' 'bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want no hot female that's been around
The block female, you nasty girl
Shakin' that thang on that man, lookin' all stank and nasty
Swore you look cute girl in them dukes, booty all out lookin' trashy
Sleazy put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out ya heezy without clothes on, I told ya
You nasty girl, you nasty you trashy
You classless girl, you sleazy you freaky
I ain't never met a girl that does the things that you do
Change don't come your way it will come back to you
Put some clothes on girl
Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without your clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' 'bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want no hot female that's been around
The block female, you nasty girl
Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without your clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' 'bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want no hot female that's been around
The block female, you nasty girl
Booty all out, tongue out her mouth
Cleavage from here to Mexico
She walks wit a twist, one hand on her hip
When she gets wit' cha, she lets it go
Nasty put some clothes on
You look so down
Nasty don't know why
You will not sit down
Boots on her feet, swear she's in heat
Flirtin' wit every man she sees
Her pants hangin' low, she never says no
Everyone knows she's easy
Nasty put some clothes on
You lookin' stank
Nasty where's your pride
You should be ashamed
You make it hard
For women like me who try to have some integrity
You make it hard
For girls like myself who respect themselves and have dignity
You nasty girl, you nasty, you trashy
You classless girl, you sleazy, you freaky
N A S T Y ya nasty, F R E A K ya freaky
Girl where's your P R I D E, put some clothes on
Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without your clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' 'bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want no hot female that's been around
The block female, you nasty girl
Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without your clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' 'bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want no hot female that's been around
The block female, you nasty girl
Ohh ohh ohh
You so nasty girl, you so, you so nasty girl
You so, you so nasty girl
You so, you so nasty girl
Put some clothes on girl
Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without your clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' 'bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want no hot female that's been around
The block female, you nasty girl
Nasty put some clothes on, I told ya
Don't walk out your house without your clothes on, I told ya
Girl what ya thinkin' 'bout lookin' that to' down, I told ya
These men don't want no hot female that's been around
The block female, you nasty girl
Nasty girl yeah
You so, you so
You so nasty girl, nasty, nasty
Nasty nasty
