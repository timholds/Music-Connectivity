WHAT!
Uh uh
Ah-huh

Give it to me now

Well, why do I keep pulling out the roots in my hair?
I'm picking at my face, its obvious there's nothing there
What do keep at the edge of my skin?
It feels so good to have a taste of what I'm crawling in
I got to go, I got to leave
The waves are changed today I'm pulling me
Even though I go with hip-hop, today, its taking to your next game*

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Cuz I'll be leaving you today now
Shake up, shake up, don't breakup breakup
Take your lips off mine*
Who could see these words are swinging?
Wake Up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up

Verse 2:
What did you keep coming out 2 sides of your mouth?
You didn't think I had hit my people on how your selling out
What did you think making your decision I'm dumb*
Manipulative, Calculative, and a pet, you thought
I didn't know I couldn't see
The spade and plain plan for using me*
Like the picture you counterfeit its time to say good-night,*
Its not a reason to say Good-bye, good-bye, Buhbye

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Cuz I'll be leaving you today now
Shake up, shake up, don't breakup breakup
Take your lips off mine*
Who could see these words are swinging?
Wake Up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up

The Coffee is brewing now...
As for me pouring out
Eyes open now I see
All that you take from me!

Wake up, wake up
Wake up, wake up
Cuz I'll be leaving you today now
Shake up, shake up, don't breakup breakup
Take your lips off mine*
Who could see these words are swinging?
Wake Up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up
