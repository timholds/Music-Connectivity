Go!
I do believe that this could be the beginning of something really special
I gotta feeling you and me together we will be sensational
But ya better hold on cuz this feeling's so strong my heart is just jumping from my chest
I'm gonna pop n lock til the wall's broke down this s**t is fierce at best
Go for the money baby... you're stone cold sister made a mess of the rest it ain't funny - oh the money baby
Got you're finger on the trigger all cocked up and ready to go - oh... oh!
Baby how you handle when the pedals to the metal - you break all the laws of physics
There ain't' no stopping when a bodies this rockin - sugar your s**t is ridiculous
Let's paint the sky red - get you out of our head - there will be no point of return
You make me chase chase for the love you make make - now let's suck and suck or burn
Go for your money baby... you're stone cold sister made
A mess of the rest it ain't funny - oh your money baby
Got you're finger on the trigger all cocked up and ready
To go - oh... oh!
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Hey Hey Hey Hey
Go for your money baby... you're stone cold sister made
A mess of the rest it ain't funny - oh your money baby
Got you're finger on the trigger all cocked up and ready
To roll - oh... oh
Go for your money baby... you're stone cold sister made
A mess of the rest it ain't funny - oh your money baby
Got you're finger on the trigger all cocked up and ready
To blow - oh... oh
