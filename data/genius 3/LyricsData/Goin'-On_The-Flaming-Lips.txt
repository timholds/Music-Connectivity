[Verse 1]
We hold our breath till the morning comes
And at last the sun shines through
But the night's so hard and it seems impossible
But what else can we do?

[Hook]
Goin' on (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Goin' on (Uh-huh, uh-huh)

[Chorus]
Listen, you'll hear it
We're getting near it
It's gone and I can feel it
Because I know you're going away
Listen, you'll hear it
We're getting near it
I know I really fear it
But we pretend it's just another day
Goin' on (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Goin' on (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Goin' on (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Goin' on

[Verse 2]
We tell ourselves it's all just normal
Til the worst of it is gone
And you give up, and you give out and you just can't take it
How will we keep going on?

[Hook]

[Chorus]
Listen, you'll hear it (going away)
We're getting near it (going away)
It's gone and I can feel it (going away)
Because I know you're going away
Listen, you'll hear it (go the day)
We're getting near it (?)
I know I really fear it (?)
But I'll pretend it's just another day
Goin' on (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Goin' on (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Goin' on (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Goin' on
We're going on
