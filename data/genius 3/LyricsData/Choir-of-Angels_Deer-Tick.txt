Sing choir of angels
Sing through the night
I'll be still
I'll be quiet

They took my body
They robbed me blind
There's no turning back now
No use in crying

Every lonely road is behind me
That led me through the changes I don't feel
And I lost sight of flesh and bone
Little I knew I was going home

Sing choir of angels
Sing me to sleep
Sing soft and sweet
I'm yours to keep

I fought their battles
And I gave my life
For peace and quiet
For pain and strife

Now every lonely road is behind me
That led me through the changes I don't feel
And I lost sight of flesh and bone
Little I knew I was going home
