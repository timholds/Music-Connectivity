I'm beating like a butterfly's wing
Unable to sleep
I'm beating like a butterfly's wing
See what you've done to me

Beating like a butterfly's wing
A butterfly

My hair's a mess, just as you left it
The snow falls back and forth
And I fall back to earth

I'm beating like a butterfly's wing
Unable to sleep
I'm beating like a butterfly's wing
See what you've done to me
