[Memphis Bleek]
Yo I park where da crack at
Heads by packs at
Down in Philly
Where my niggas roll crabs at
Pack gats at
Run up in a label
Take a nigga ass cap
You ass cat

[Beani Siegel]
I'm dat kid
Dat'll catch a himmy and post bail
Get locked for another niggas body
Won't tell
Get head from a dime bitch
And won't nail
Bag a dime from a half a brick
Wit no scale

[Memph Man]
Yo you know where to find me
In da PH. lobby
Two first and Siegel
Niggas know not to try me
Post wit a shotty
Tims on how I be
All blacked out
Hoody on wit da crack out

[B Mac]
You can catch Mac in Marcy
4-5-6ing it
Orange Bo Jackons
New York Knicking it
Durag Nautica sweats
Slaughter da set
Dope spot rushin'
Set up shop on Flushing

Chorus
]From my hood to your hood
Yo I got you nigga
]From block to your block
Yo I got you nigga
My bitch to your bitch
My hood to your hood
My block to your block
Aiyo I got you nigga
[2x]

[Beanie Mac]
Tray snub in da club
Real high when I come through
Layin' blood in da club
You can die if you want to
I stay strapped
Slugged you out
That's how I ride in da jungle
Imagine Mac
"What a Thug About"
Live in da Tunnel

[Memph Bleek]
I roll up
Philly live
Pearl handle 4-5
Killer
Ginuwine drive
I ride or die
Me and Beanie got front doe
Puttin' in work
And I'm a Brooklyn nigga
Put da semi to work

[Beanie Siegel]
Yeah you know how we play
From PA to BK
Smash and scrape scrape
Stash and break cake
You can feel the steel
Get cut or bust down
Front on tech ball
Smith and Wessin like Buck Town

[Memphis Bleek]
I'm in da 7-6 Jers
Wit twist up herb
Nigga got nerve
Frost bit wit no furs
Chofers
Straight to Philly no turns
Exit Ben Frankiln
To brake down da birds

Chorus
