Sippin on my lemon and ginger
And I can count the times
On a couple of fingers
When things weren't wonderful
But worthwhile love is a handful
I mean when I say, you're beautiful
Don't waste your tears, on those images
You have too many years ahead of you
And not too many before you
And all I can say is
Darling, let go of the hurt in your heart
Baby I've said from the start
I'm here beside you, took too long to find you
I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere
Darling, let go of the hurt in your heart
Baby I've said from the start
I'm here beside you, took too long to find you
I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere
Now I know
Times have been hard
And in those instances
Our feet are trottin broken glass
Don't forget
What we already have
And we can keep going
But hold on to what we have
I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere
Darling, let go of the hurt in your heart
Baby I've said from the start
I'm here beside you, took too long to find you
I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere
Darling, let go of the hurt in your heart
Baby I've said from the start
I'm here beside you, took too long to find you
I'm not going anywhere, I'm not going anywhere
