Somebody's walking among us shake it off
Ooh I'll let you sleep late at night now shake it off
You can't take me down the rail
Said now take back in the rail
Oh I've been knocked down a lot
Think that's why I was begot we're gonna shake it off
Somebody's back at your door kid 3 am
Ooh take it soft shake it off
Just thank god like he's so kind I'm glad that I'm figuring a lot
Oh I've been knocked down a few
It's got to be intellectual or two
I've been knocked down a lot think that's why I was begot
I'm gonna shake it off shake it offâ€¦
