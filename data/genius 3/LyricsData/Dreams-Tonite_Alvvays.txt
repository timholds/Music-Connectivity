[Verse 1]
Rode here on the bus
Now you're one of us
It was magic hour
Counting motorbikes on the turnpike
One of Eisenhower's

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Live your life on a merry-go-round
Who starts a fire just to let it go out?

[Chorus]
If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight?
If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?

[Verse 2]
On the lead guitar
Said you'd go to work
In the waking hour
In fluorescent light
Antisocialites watch a wilting flower

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Live your life on a merry-go-round
Who builds a wall just to let it fall down?

[Chorus]
If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight?
If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?

[Bridge]
Don't sit by the phone for me
Wait at home for me, all alone for me
Your face was supposed to be hanging over me like a rosary
So morose for me; seeing ghosts of me; writing oaths to me
Is it so naive to wonder...

[Chorus]
If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
If I saw you on the street, would I have you in my dreams tonight, tonight?
