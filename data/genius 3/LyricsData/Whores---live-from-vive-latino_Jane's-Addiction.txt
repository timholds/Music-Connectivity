Way down low where the streets are littered
I find my fun with the freaks and the niggers
I don't want much, man, give me a little
I'm gonna take my chances if I get 'em
I love them whores, they never judge you
What can you say when you're a whore?
They cast that pearl and it don't upset 'em
They take chances if I get 'em
Wanna see me go off, give me some more
Mother fucker, need a little more
Goddamn you, give me some more
Mother fucker, give me some more
You give me breadcrumb, uh
And I'm tired of livin' the bosses' dream
They'll squeeze you dry, man, if you let 'em
Better take your, take your, take your chances if you get 'em
Hear me go off, give me some more
Mother fucker, need a little more
Goddamn you, give me some more
Mother fucker, give me some more
I wanna get a whore
Oh, I wanna go get a whore
Oh, I wanna go get a whore
