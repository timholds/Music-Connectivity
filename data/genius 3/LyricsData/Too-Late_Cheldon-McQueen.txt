[Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Now that you want me it's too late
It's too late for love
Or when you got me
You don't care
It's too late for love
I'm tired, so tired of playing
Playing such a little fool
My mind is made up
I'm not coming back to you

[Verse 1: Cheldon McQueen]
I'm dying trying to find the perfect timing just tell you that everything that we had is declining
All these little things only serve as a reminder
Toothbrush on the counter
Clothes in the dryer
You're only funky as your last cut, you focus on that ass and your past eventually catch up
Now that's bad luck
More so a bad look
But shit there's no such thing as a half crook
Or are you that shook?

[Verse 2: Natalie Bergman]
I need a man that treats me right
He'll treat me right
He'll feed me supper more than twice
Yes he will, yes yes, he will
I'm not asking for lots of fancy toys
I don't need a lot of fancy toys
Someone to keep me warm at night
So why, why when you had me boy
You must've been blind
Goodbye, bye
Now you taste the teardrops that I cried

[Verse 3: Cheldon McQueen]
I forget they used to call me white back in high school
Cause my pants used to hug a nigga waist
Now they girlfriends treat my dick like an iphone
Swear they like to rub a nigga case
Most my watches digital, all my flows critical
All these haters looking fucking green like they piccolo
Held my city down from the underground
Probably been waiting to drop for a couple summers now
Knew a couple girls that used to give me that run around now they run around try to get up in my dun ta duns like. girl do you see him
Pull up in the b-m
Now that's what the fuck I call a black european
I'm a b-a-double l-e-r
Land all these rappers face down in the e-r
Close curtain check the black box on the triage
Man, sorry life's just a bia
Quarter pound round how does she ride, hmm?
Andele andele mama e-i, uh-oh
Murder this bitch in bruno maglis
Swag bruno mars, jimi, jada, yeezy, marley beast

[Bridge: Cheldon McQueen]
My ride is tinted
The bitch with me inside a menace
She throw it at me like she Roger Clemens
