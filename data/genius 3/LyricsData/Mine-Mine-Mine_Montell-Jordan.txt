Hey baby I like it when you are next to me
Wit that body horizontally
Put your legs comfortable in my bed in your lingere
Wit my pillow under your head and
Honey I like you cuz u trustin me
Just so glad to have you on my team
So I keep it real wit you, come feelin you, layin here

(Chorus)
Layin next to you and I
Kissin and holding you tite

And wat I feel is real
