[Hook]
There's a time to play and there's a time for sex
There's a time to lounge and there's a time to catch wreck
Watch your spot, cause if you sleep you'll get got
Our sound is hot because we're true to hip-hop

It's the little big man, y'all little niggas just relax
I'm coming like a nut, butt niggas catching heart attacks
Adversaries better maintain
Don't even riff, scram, cause I'm a one-man gangbang
Boom, I hit it, now money you really did it
Brung out the beast in me, and the freaks be getting with it
Yes the fame is what they sweat
But if you came for me to entertain then I'll make you wet
Meanwhile, got to keep a low profile
My style is true, so yes I do smile
Original, just like the Dirty Rotten
And while our foes are plotting, Show is riding shotgun

[Hook]

Since I hit the boom, they say my brain is doomed
I object, it's sustained, now name this tune
Making more than other brothers on computers
Long as my vision ain't blurry, don't worry, pass the buddhas
Forget karate, cause I'd rather kick a lyric
You ain't trying to hear it, then I'll be talking to your spirit
Show hit me off with the hype shit
Who needs pencils and papers, brain cells is what I write with
The format, told you last LP I'm all that
Step to A.G., then you best to be sure, black
Roll with my crew, I got the OE
20 dollar sack, and my hat to the back just like TLC

Now when you play, it better not be with Show and Dre
Or sex in between the sheets at my rest
Now it's time to lounge and I'm free from all clowns
And when I'm through catching wreck I hit the cess, yes

[Hook]

I get rough and then I hurt 'em like a puff of the ganja
Tough like Tonka, you'll get seen by the Jolly Green Monster
The G sell now hell no
A good fellow who sports the shell toe
So don't step to me, I'll shoot you and your deputy
Everybody's in jeopardy except for me
They pop shit, like their skills I can't top it
I'm the one to rock with, lounge and puff some chocolate
I'm coming through, so what you gonna do
When I hit you in the head with the lead from the number 2
Or black boot, leaving suckers froze like a statue
Styles are coming at you, real like my tattoo
