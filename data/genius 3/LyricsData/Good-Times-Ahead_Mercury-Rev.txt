The first hint of morning, someone's snoring
The cat upstairs is yawning and calling her name
She's in a playful way and a venomous mood
When she bites my ear, it's just for fun

And I believe her when she says, "I'm glad we never wed"
Better off with the butter than the bread
Then quick, before she breathes, so gently I'm seized
My ear to her belly, whoa, nelly

It's just like she said
Better off with the butter than the bread
Now take it as a warning, the first hint of morning
There's good times ahead

Open the dawning, cars are crawling
Their rides outside are snoring, and it's pouring with rain
And in the strangest way the night behaves
In patterns and shapes that suggest that I escaped

And I believe her when she says, "I'm glad you never left"
Better off with a lover than a friend
Than quick before she speaks
So quickly I ease my lips to her cheek and thank Jesus

It's just like she said
Better off with the butter than the bread
Now take it as a warning, the first hint of morning
Oh, there's good times ahead

(Just like she said)
Oh, there's good times ahead
(Just like she said)
There's good times ahead

(Just like she said, good times ahead)
There's good times ahead
Yeah, there's good times ahead
