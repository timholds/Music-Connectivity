[Instrumental in multiple parts]

[Short A part 1]
"To seek the sacred river Alph
To walk the caves of ice
To break my fast on honeydew
And drink the milk of Paradise"

[B part 1]
I had heard the whispered tales of immortality
The deepest mystery
From an ancient book I took a clue
I scaled the frozen mountain tops of eastern lands unknown
Time and Man alone
Searching for the lost Xanadu

Xanadu

[Synth break 1]

[A part 2]
To stand within the Pleasure Dome
Decreed by Kubla Khan
To taste anew the fruits of life
The last immortal man
To find the sacred river Alph
To walk the caves of ice

Oh, I will dine on honeydew
And drink the milk of Paradise
Oh, paradise!

[Running instrumental]

[B part 2]
A thousand years have come and gone but time has passed me by
Stars stopped in the sky
Frozen in an everlasting view
Waiting for the world to end, weary of the night
Praying for the light
Prison of the lost
Xanadu

Xanadu

[Synth break 2]

[A part 3]
Held within the Pleasure Dome
Decreed by Kubla Khan
To taste my bitter triumph
As a mad immortal man
Nevermore shall I return
Escape these caves of ice

For I have dined on honeydew
And drunk the milk of Paradise
Woah, is it paradise?

[Outro instrumental]
