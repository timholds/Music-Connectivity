[Verse 1 - Scorcher]
I don't give a f*ck about anything that happened
Cah breaking up with you is way better than I imagined
Oh so now you got some new guy
You're feeling like you're too fly
How does it feel to know if I want I can make you two time
Fronting like you forgot what we been through
I bought your first Pradas, you bought my first V
So I thought we was inseparable
But we was insensible
Now you're green with your envy
And I'm just feeling incredible
While you're fronting like you fell in love
With someone that you haven't
Our ship sailed, it was the f*cking titanic
It was love that died tragic
No happy ending
A sour seperation with no getting back together
Choices that we made in a second could last a lifetime
But f*ck it
You're cool with yours and I'm alright with mine
It's nothing
I know you're still afraid, this is bittersweet
'Ca I'm missing what we did up in them sheets
Sky

[Chorus - Loick Essien]
It's been seven months it ain't heard from you
Have you forgot all the things I did for you
Well guess what
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
No more
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
No more

[Verse 2 - Scorcher]
Before I used to care
Now I couldn't care less
So all you're getting's air
You could have been my heiress
My empress
Be we it was cool while it lasted
You tried to treat me like a fool but I'm past it
I ain't looking through my rear view
I'm looking through my windshield
You think that we could get back
But all I think is get real
The problem is there wasn't one
Always some drama
You had me feeling like an omnibus
On me like them officers
Oh lord
When it was good the sh*t felt great
But when it wasn't it was sh*t, hell, hate
Oh you got a new man
I don't care, I don't care
Go ahead and talk smack
I don't hear, I don't hear, yeah
My life couldn't be sweeter with some sugar in it
You're just a migrane that's got a lickle pus*y with it
No hard feelings
Over, I'm past dealings
I'm still grinning when I'm thinking about our last evening
Sky

[Chorus - Loick Essien]
It's been seven months it ain't heard from you
Have you forgot all the things I did for you
Well guess what
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
No more
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
No more
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
No more
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
No more

[Verse 3 - Loick Essien]
You were killing me with all the lies
Don't tell myself I try
Wanted you to be by my side
I thought this was for life

I had to leave so I could take myself
I know it's killing you like hell
Had to let you go
I just hope you know
That I really don't care at all

[Outro - Loick Essien & Scorcher]
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't
No more
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't
No more
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't
No more
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't care
I don't
No more
