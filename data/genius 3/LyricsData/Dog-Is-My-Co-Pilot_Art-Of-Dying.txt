You could offer me patience or violence
You could offer me blood or peace
In a letter let me know when it’s over
Just keep it far away from me

You could end him, you could let him go
He’s just a criminal I don’t know
You could hang him, you could set him free
As long as he don’t sit next to me

God is gracious, god is good, he’ll understand
God is gracious, god is good, it’s in his hands
God is gracious, god is good, this god of mine
And if your god met my god we’d be alright

You could fill every mouth on the planet
Or send me news of death toll highs
You could tell me how to make a difference
Not now, I’ve got plans tonight

You could swing from an arrow or olive branch
You could hang from the status quo
You could offer me a heart for bravery
As long as I don’t have to go

God is gracious, god is good, he’ll understand
God is gracious, god is good, it’s in his hands
God is gracious, god is good, this god of mine
And if your god met my god we’d be all right
