All the money in the world can’t save your life
All the money in the world can’t save your life
All the money in the world can’t buy this life
Yeah, Imma live forever

All the money in the world can’t save your life
All the money in the world can’t save your life
All the money in the world can’t buy this life
Imma live forever
Imma live forever

Just moved to Atlanta
She said she hate dancing
The money don’t matter
The cork hit the ceiling
The Franklin’s still with it
She love how she living  but hate all the feelings
That come with it but fuck it let’s get it
She said she need millions (what)
She said she need millions
And she do whatever to get it
Let’s get it

They got no limit
Oh how ironic
Cause she bout it
She looking clouded
All that champagne she drowning
Her parents don’t call her
But that money keep falling
She dropped out of college
She said she want commas
So she packed up that Honda and said

All the money in the world can’t save your life
All the money in the world can't save your life
All the money in this world can’t buy this life
Yeah, Imma live forever

All the money in the world can’t save your life
All the money in the world can’t save your life
All the money in the world can’t buy this life
Imma live forever

Only apologies go to my momma
Yeah, 90 on 85
Just to profit 185
I’m tryna stay alive
Boy, I gotta stay alive
The future up all of this
Your daughter know all of this
Boy I called all of this
Did this shit by myself
Fuck any nigga that’s ain’t
Last year I needed your help
My niggas is wallowing on probation
Sleep is my only vacation
Never no lies in these verses
Don’t be surprised by this current
This wave we created ain’t for all you surfers


All the money in the world can’t save your life
All the money in the world can’t save your life
All the money in the world can’t buy this life
Yeah Imma live forever

All the money in the world can’t save your life
All the money in the world can’t save your life
All the money in the world can’t buy this life
Imma live forever
