[Verse 1]
I wanna cut through my skin
And pull you within
My heart burns like the sun
As our flesh becomes one

[Bridge]
In the darkness
My heart aches at the sight of you
Trembles and quakes within sight of you
In the darkness

Our bodies burning
Tides are turning
Somehow stopping time
What is becoming of my heart and mind?

[Chorus 2x]
(In the darkness)
All that you want from me is all I have to give
(In the darkness)
Coming so easily, learning how to live

[Verse 2]
I will surrender my soul
And give you control
Make me a martyr for love
To the heavens above

[Bridge]
In the darkness
My heart aches at the sight of you
Trembles and quakes within sight of you
In the darkness

Our bodies burning
Tides are turning
Somehow stopping time
What is becoming of my heart and mind?

[Chorus 4x]
(In the darkness)
All that you want from me is all I have to give
(In the darkness)
Coming so easily, learning how to live
