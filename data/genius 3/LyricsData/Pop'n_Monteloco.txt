[Monteloco]
Yeah
No matter what
We always get it poppin'
Ha ha

Hook: Monteloco
We gon' get it poppin' like
It's your birthday
We gon' get it poppin' like
It's a holiday
We gon' get it poppin' like
Hey, hey
Hey, hey
Hey, hey

Chorus: Monteloco
Hey
Girl (Hey, girl)
Is it poppin' or what? (Or what)
Hey
Girl (Hey, girl)
Is it poppin' or what? (Or what)
It's poppin'
It's goin' down right now
It's poppin'
It's goin' down right now
It's poppin'
It's goin' down right now
Right now, right now
Right now, right
Now

(Verse 1)
The way I look at it (Yeah)
I throw a hook at it (There you go)
Write some sixteen's, yeah
Your boy is good at it (That's right)
See that chick right there? (Right there)
I think they're interest
Must be the M logo on my necklace
Yes, it's
Fresher than a French kiss (Ah!)
From a French chick
Parlez-vous francais?
Baby girl
We do this all day like
HEY HEY
HEY HEY
Poppin'
Like a pair of new kicks (Yeah)
Outfit to match
Lookin' real Slick
Like Rick
Rick Rick the Ruler (Slick Rick)
That's some old school trivia for you new buds
No matter where I am, I get it poppin' (Yeah)
I'm to Oxnard where Dre is to Compton (Right)
Not too often, (???) in the rock
I gotta check a hater for jockin' my stock

Repeat Chorus

Break: Monteloco
It's poppin'
With a capital P
It's poppin'
In the club, in the streets
It's poppin'
Like Rocwilder Beats
It's poppin'
From the west to the east
It's poppin'
Baby boy, what you think
It's poppin'
Lots of girls, lots of drinks
It's poppin'
Monteloco's in the house
Sit back and relax and watch as I turn it out

(Verse 2)
When it's poppin', it's poppin' (Yeah)
More than just crackin' (Uh hun)
Talkin' about
Round the clock action
Hit the liquor store (Come on)
To get some liquor more
I drink Pacifico, then I spit a sicker flow
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo, there you go, G.I.Joe
Lookin' for a G.I.Jane
To ease my pain
I'm switching lanes in the 'Llac or the Range
Stackin' change
Mackin' dames
Crackin' flame
Fire
Like Eragon
I'm never wrong
When it comes to puttin' together
Clever songs
Poppin'
Like fight night in Vegas
It's so outrageous
It's so contagious
Take her to the places
With the girls
With the skinny waists and some pretty faces (Daymn, faces)
From Beverly Hills to Skid Row
When it's poppin', poppin'
You know

Repeat Chorus

Repeat Hook

[Monteloco]
Yeah
Monteloco, west coast
805, baby
We always get it poppin'
Yo Rocwilder
Good lookin' out on the beat, homie
Yeah
