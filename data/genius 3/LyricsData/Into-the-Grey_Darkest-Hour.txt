We've got to get out
No turning back
Leave ruination to the rats
We're setting a course
That's out of our reach
Never returning to this
Civilization at it's worst and
It's starting to sink into itself so

Stay away, stay away from the old ways
Starting over
Stay away, stay away from betrayal rediscovered

A dark history of squalor and squander
Like weeds to the endless fires

Elevate yourself to the sun
Burn it black and let the ash rain down
Roaming through the celestial fields
A new seed a new beginning

We're moving to enlightened ground
On an ouroboran whirlwind
We're blowing away and never coming down

Stay away, stay away from the old ways
Starting over
Stay away, stay away from the betrayal rediscovered

We all fade into the grey
It's a place you know better than anyone
The isolation burns
We all fade into the grey
From a seed to a bloom from the grave to the womb
The isolation burns

What world awaits, what world awaits
When this one is dry and desolate
What world awaits, what world awaits
When this one is vacant and drained

And I'll watch it burn

Elevate yourself to the sun
Burn it black and let the ash rain down
Roaming through the celestial fields
A new seed a new beginning

A new day risen from the ashes
Brings our eternal remains
Fade away into the ground and
The end is beginning again
