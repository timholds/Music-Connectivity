Oh, yeah, O.K
Let's take it back a little bit
Ya know, it's not that it's no good now, I just
I'm remembering how, but let me tell you

Let's go back in time
When seeing your ID on mine
Made me crazy ooh baby I'm saying
Let's go back there (go back there)
Let's take it there (take it there)
I'm talking bout back in time
When you wanted to know my every move
Tired to keep it smooth keepin' up with me
You drove me crazy ohh baby

Let's go back there (go back there)
Let's take it there (take it there)

When you didn't know me, didn't need me
I wanted to touch me couldn't leave me
I couldn't know how far this would go
I couldn't know if this was for sure
We just could not
We just could not get enough of it baby, let's go

Have that wreckless love that crazy love
That off the wall, won't stop 'til I get enough kind of love
I need that love so baby, let's go
Have that wreckless love that crazy love
That I don't really care we can have it anywhere
Kind of love that wreckless love

Let's go back in time when our kiss was brand new
An adventure not perfected a little hesitant
Let's go back there (go back there)
Let's take it there (take it there)

Take it back in time
When forever was a minute, and eternity was a second
I'm stressing that we gotta go back there (go back there)
Let's take it there (take it there)

When you didn't know me, didn't need me
I wanted to touch me couldn't leave me
I couldn't know how far this would go
I couldn't know if this was for sure
We just could not
We just could not get enough of it baby, let's go

Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That off the wall, won't stop 'til I get enough kind of love
I need that love so baby, let's go
Have that wreckless love that crazy love
That I don't really care we can have it anywhere
Kind of love that wreckless love

Ooh baby, let's go

Have that wreckless love
That crazy love
That off the wall, won't stop 'til I get enough kind of love
I need that love so baby, let's go
Have that wreckless love that crazy love
That I don't really care we can have it anywhere
Kind of love that wreckless love
