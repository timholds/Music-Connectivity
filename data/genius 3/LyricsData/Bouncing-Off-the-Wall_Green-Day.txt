[Verse 1]
Concrete dream
I'm gonna make a scene
Radio
Covered in gasoline
Sleeping in reverse and everybody's bouncing off the walls

[Verse 2]
Bombs away
It's just another day
Of idle threats
The secret alphabet
And I wouldn't sweat it
Everybody's bouncing off the walls
(I'm bouncing off the walls!)

Alright

[Verse 3]
Concrete kiss
Come on and do the twist
The Radio, my little exorcist
We're all getting pissed
And everybody's bouncing off the walls

'Cause it's all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks
And we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes

'Cause it's all that I want
And I want to be free
I got Satan riding next to me
'Cause we're all bloody freaks
And we'll give you the creeps
Chasing fireflies and zeroes
