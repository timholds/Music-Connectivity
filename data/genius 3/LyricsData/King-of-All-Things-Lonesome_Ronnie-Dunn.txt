[Verse 1]
I'm the ruler of this lonely land
Whoa a fool that's what I am
I'm the one who let you
Slip right through his hands
I watched my treasures fade to rust
All my gold has turned to dust
Once proud keeper of a burning flame called love
No longer shared by us

[Chorus]
I am the king
Of all things
Oh let's say goodbye, make you cry
Leave you sad and lonely
I'm on my knees
Come back to me
Oh the ruler of a heart that now lives broken
I'm the king of all things lonesome

[Verse 2]
Shades of black and white and grey
Oh now color my domain
Long lonely days
Over a barren waste I reign
Sad blue moon hangs all alone
A haunting wind blows all night long
A heart-sick whippoorwill, sings a tearful song
Oh my queen of hearts is gone

[Chorus]
I am the king
Of all things, oh I
Let's say goodbye, make you cry
Leave you sad and lonely
I'm on my knees
Come back to me
Oh the ruler of a heart that now lives broken
I'm the king of all things lonesome, oh-oh-oh
I'm the king of all things lonesome

I am the king (Of all things)
Of all things (Sad and lonely)
Let's say goodbye, make you cry
Leave you sad and lonely

I'm on my knees
Come back to me
Oh the ruler of a heart that now lives broken
I'm the king of all things lonesome, I-I-I
I'm the king of all things lonesome, I-I-I
