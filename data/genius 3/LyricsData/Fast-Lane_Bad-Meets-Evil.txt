[Verse 1: Royce Da 5'9"]
First verse, uh, I'm armed 'til I'm on an island
My life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt, or kill y'all with kindness
I kill ya, my natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you've been borned
Or if you conformed, slap up a cop
And then snatch him outta his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin', you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so
That basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight, my blood type's the 80's
My 90's was like the Navy
You was like the Brady's, you still fly kites daily

[Verse 2: Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumping "Ice Ice Baby"
Screaming, "Shady 'til I die!"
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once
So I'm thinking 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is
‘Cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really I belong inside a dang insane asylum
Came to drive them trailer parks crazy
I am Back! And I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's "back" with a capital B with an exclamation mark
Maybe you should listen when I flip the linguistics
‘Cause when I rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim
A statistic of this shit, ‘cause after I spit the bullets
I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics; so get this dick, I'ma live this—

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed
Just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

[Verse 3: Royce Da 5'9"]
Yeah, my whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle as Captain Morgan attacks my organs
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the devil that says
"I'll let you take me, you let me take a shovel
Dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian."
Go back and forth and, more beef that you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy down
My tenement, chimney now; the semi’s the remedy, pow
Spin him around, enterin' in the vicinity—

[Verse 4: Eminem]
Now, was called M&M
But he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up, and spitted him out
Girl, giddy-up, now get-get down
He's lookin' around this club
And it looks like people are havin' a shit-fit now
Yeah, little t-t-trailer trash
Take a look who's back in t-t-town!
Did I s-s-stutter, motherfucker?
Fuck the mall, he shuts the whole motherfuckin' Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9"
To hold this bitch down, like a motherfuckin' chick underwater he's tryin' to d-d-drown
Shorty, when you dance, you got me captivated
Just by the way that you keep lickin' them dick-suckin' lips
I'm agitated, aggravated
To the point you don't suck my dick
Then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
Then I'm have to take it

[Verse 5: Royce Da 5'9"]
And then after takin' that I'ma catch a case
It's gon' be fascinatin'
It's gon' say the whole rap game passed away
On top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater, slash massive masturbator
To Michael Jackson's activator
Meaning I'm on fire, off the top, might wanna back up data
Rollin' over hip-hop in a verbal tractor trailer
Homie, they're sick, you could normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense?
These shell casings is just like a bag of paper
Drop in the lap of a tax evader, homie, they spent

[Verse 6: Eminem]
Now make that ass drop, like a sack of potatoes
What, girl, I'm the crack-a-lator
Percolator of this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell your boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You're rollin' with a player
You won't be exaggeratin' when you say you're livin'

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
Livin' life in the fast lane
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed
Just enjoyin' the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
