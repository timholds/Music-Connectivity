SAY OOOOOOOOOOOOOH

Waking up, feeling naked
In my clothes inside a room that's vacant
I lost my nerve it's unnerving
I know there is something forgetting

I searched the moon, i lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls i hit the streets
I'm down in the pavement looking
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around and i'm a complete disaster
I'm missing you

Remember? it was the first time
I told you i loved you at the bus station (OOOOOOOH)
Don't forget, cause it's not over
I'm not lost cause i'm just missing you

I searched the moon, i lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls i hit the streets
I'm down in the pavement looking
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around and i'm a complete disaster
I'm missing you

Well she's my blood
And she's my soul
I get so lost
Out in the cold
Feel so far
Like this lone star
It gets so hard
When i'm missing you
HEY!

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
You're not around and i'm a fucking disaster
I'm missing you
