(Chorus x2)
Haters hate hard but it motivates
Motivates us to get right
Climbin to the top of the mountain
Sleepin on the chrissy every night
Gotta keep this thing goin
Necklace glowin, already knowin
Give props you know who the best is
Franchize!
You know what so so def is

Im draked up laced up
Ridin through the city
Top let down
We ain't blowin on the 50
Its trigger man and jeezy man and DFB, boy and i gotta hold it down for the DFB boy
They hate us bad, hate to see us niggas comin ? just lookin like money
They can't stop us. we on top of our game
They some imposters and they tryin to call us some lames
We blow past em like in gone in 60 seconds
Sign with ya main man its time to move records
No time for them ?
They dont scare us at all
We on a whole nother level
They can't blast at all
You see us workin. puttin it down thats for certain
You can see me wit a microscope
Zoomin through your curtains
Im sharp as a razor, purple hay blazer
We smile at you niggas, theres so many imitators

(Chorus)
Haters hate hard but it motivates
Motivates us to get right
Climbin to the top of the mountain
Sleepin on the chrissy every night
Gotta keep this thing goin
Necklace glowin, already knowin
Give props you know who the best is
Franchize!
You know what so so def is

One of the best there ever is and the best there ever was
Im the motherfuckin truth and in everything i does
Niggas hatin every day
??
Ill eradicate yo ass
If push comes to shove
Pop says stay focused
Dont get stunned by the buzz
One shot to take your life so a nigga stay in blood
Its when a niggas character is not made up
??
??
I done been had cash
Its just more for me to pop wit
Niggas ain't gonna like it when i pop to a drop sick
