Fell on bad, fell on bad days
All your wicked, all your wicked ways
Left me cold, left me cold

All your dark, all your dark hair
Weave for me, weaved a cold snare
Left me hung, left me hung

I know it's there
But I still can't see
Feel my veins disappear
Virgin skin and raven hair
All the devil's devilry

On the west, on the west wind
I hear your voice
Still it's tempting
Like a siren, like a siren

I know it's there
But I still can't see
Feel my veins disappear
Virgin skin and raven hair
All the devil's devilry

Doesn't feel so bad now
Doesn't feel so bad now

It doesn't feel so bad now
It doesn't feel so bad now
