[Intro]

[Verse 1: J.R. Writer]
Now look at shorty, she laced in the flyest gear
Heart racing when I appear
Come pace with a pioneer (that's me) hunh
We could pace the entire teer, after that
Go and pack, we skatin' up outta here (let's go) yeah
Take a place in the mile fare, and fuck ya man
I'm ya man, be faithful when I ain't there (yeah)
I, see you draped in designer wear
Nice clothes, like those
I'll take you to buy a pair (come on)
Where, that's Paris to Malon
Fill ya bag up with Vuitton, you the baddest in the bon
Understand, I'mma rapper with some charm
Don't worry about them little groupies grabbing on my arm
Cuz that just ben my life, benz and ice
Swimming YIKES, often, stalking
Following, I'm in they sight
But you could come through, 1-2
Dim the lights, touch for touch, what's the rush
Mama you could spend the night

[Hook]
It's like
(What am I gonna do about you ooh)
It's like
(What am I gonna do about you ooh)
You make me say
(Oh girl, Oh girl)
You make me say
(Oh girl, Oh girl)
Over and Over
(Oh girl, Oh girl)
It's like
(What am I gonna do about you ooh)

[Verse 2: J.R. Writer]
Now we could squeeze and cruise
Throw on the visa shoes
Drop the loser, pick the winner
Even though you seem confused, not being rude
But ma, you need a dude to take you out to B-B-Q's
And I'll take you out to B-B-Q's
Show you the finer things, Mr. K's
Mr. Chows, sit and chow
Pour some wine, sip Crystal
It's the style, sit a while
Talk a sec, talking sex
It's just foul, I know it's been a while
Go ahead, grin and smile
Here you go hicking now, talking 'bout he brought you ice
Like it's the thought that counts
Don't worry about the cost or price
Then he look you in your face, like of course it's ice
Girl come get with baller, I could pay your mortgage twice
And that's four for life, Naw that's more for life
Go ahead and board your flight
We hitting the resort tonight, The results tonight
Will be me and you, seeing you
Peek-a-Boo, come here, turn off the lights

[Outro]
(What am I gonna do about you ooh)
(What am I gonna do about you ooh)
(Oh girl, Oh girl)
(Oh girl, Oh girl)
(Oh girl, Oh girl)
(What am I gonna do about you ooh)
