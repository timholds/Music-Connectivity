I shake the dust from off myself
And set my face like flint
Scorch the thorns entangling me
And pull me closer into you
Because this city's full of devils
And the streets clad with coal
I remember every waking day
As I chewed on your soul

On and on
A recollection of our failure
On and on
Forget the past, we're moving onward
Tell my devils I'm never coming back

I can see that your motives are not pure, and I feel ashamed
I can see that your motives are not pure, they're not yours!

THROW THE STONES, THEY WEIGH HEAVY IN YOUR HANDS!
THROW THE STONES, THEY WEIGH HEAVY IN YOUR HANDS!

On and on
A recollection of our failure
On and on
All the people crushed on the threshing floor

I can see that your motives are not pure, and I feel ashamed

This body, a burning building
It's nothing but flesh and bone
This body, a burning building
Turn and run or face the hounds
FACE THE HOUNDS!

Tell my devils I'm never coming back
