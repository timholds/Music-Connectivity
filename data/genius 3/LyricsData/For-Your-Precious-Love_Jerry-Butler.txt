Your precious love
Means more to me
Than any love could ever be
For when I wanted you
I was so lonely and so blue
For that's what love will do

And darling, I'm
(I'm so surprised)
Oh, when I first realized
(I realized)
That a-you were fooling me

And darling
(Whoa-ooh)
They say that our love won't grow
But I just wanna tell them
(Ooo-ooo-ooo)
That they don't know-oh-ho

For as long
As you're in love with me
Our love will grow wider
Deeper than any sea

And of all the things that I want
In this whole wide world
Is just for you to say
That you'll be my girl

And woo-ooo-ooo
(Wanting you)
Wanting you
(Oh-ooh, I'm lonely and blue)
I'm so-whoa, lonely
(That's what love will do)
