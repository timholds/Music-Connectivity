[Verse 1]
An empty street, an empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone, the rooms are getting smaller
I wonder how, I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had, the songs we sang together
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far

[Chorus]
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again, my love
Overseas from coast to coast
To find a place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again, my love

[Verse 2]
I try to read, I go to work
I'm laughing with my friends
But I can't stop, to keep myself from thinking, oh no
I wonder how, I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had the songs, we sang together
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far

[Chorus]
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again, my love
Overseas from coast to coast
To find a place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again

[Bridge]
To hold you in my arms
To promise you my love
To tell you from the heart
You're all I'm thinking of
I'm reaching for the love that seem so far

[Chorus]
(So), So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again, my love
Overseas from coast to coast
To find a place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again (my love)

[Outro]
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue
To see you once again, (Oh, my love)
Overseas from coast to coast
To find a place I love the most
Where the fields are green
To see you once again, my love
