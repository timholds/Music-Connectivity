[Verse 1]
Good Morning Thunder, just came to talk
They teamed us up in the morning draw
They called our names and the young bucks laughed
They say our glory days have passed
It’s been a while, for you and me
Guess the last time was Calgary
You broke my leg in the starting gate
Still I held on for a long heartache

[Chorus]
Thunder when I grab your rein, we’ll be in that storm again
These old boot heals in your side
Hanging on for one last ride
Screaming cowgirls on their feet
Lets give them what the came to see
They won’t know its our last rodeo

[Verse 2]
I was the best, you were the worst
To be a star I had to ride you first
The saddle’s always been my home
You were born to run alone
Its funny now, that all these years, the clock was all we had to fear
That’s what this old game’s about
It looks like our time is running out

[Chorus]

[Outro]
No they won’t know, its our last rodeo
