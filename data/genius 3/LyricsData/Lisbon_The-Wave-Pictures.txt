It was one of those days
The dead were digging upwards through the earth
I saw ghosts in the rain, ghosts in the ice
Ghosts in the airport carousel
Little Richard on the radio
Coffee in my cup
I flew in from Lisbon with a song to wake you up
A song to wake you up
And a kiss to wake you up
I flew in to hold you in my arms
Almond butter for my baby
Beauty in my bed
I lightly pinch a wrinkle in your brow
I saw ghosts in the trees
Ghosts in the streets
Ghots way out in China town
Little Richard on the radio
Coffee in my cup
I flew in from Lisbon with a song to wake you up
A song to wake you up
And a kiss to wake you up
I flew in to hold you in my arms
To hold you in my arms
To hold you in my arms
I flew in to hold you in my arms
To hold you in my arms
To hold you in my arms
I flew in to hold you in my arms
To hold you in my arms
To hold you in my arms
I flew in to hold you in my arms
To hold you in my arms
To hold you in my arms
I flew in to hold you in my arms
