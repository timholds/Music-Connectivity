[Hook : Noelle Flores & Astro]

I don’t know why
I’m so into you
Could it be the first impression
I made of you since…

It’s like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
I’m seekin’ bad shawtys that got something to show
So if you...down to roll
You should let me know
I got ambitions baby
I got ambitions baby


It’s like everywhere I look and everywhere I go
Cats wanna spend time but got nothing to show
So if you...down to roll
And I’m… letting you know
I got ambitions baby
I got ambitions baby

[Verse 1 : Astro]

I hit her like…sup love
Whats goin’ on with ya
You angel me out the end goal
Then that’s the wrong picture
I just met ya but I missed ya
But jogging my noggin’ for so long these feelings are so strong
Got the beuty of a, goddess
Surfboard shirt on
My D ain't the wave but I can let you, ride it
It’s so exciting never seen an aura so inviting
You flatbushing? Fort greening? Or bed stuying?
You ain't a BK girl then that’s a shock
But still we could build like its straight of the block
Peepin your watch
You need a ring
With the the the rock
Maybe not that far, lets hope we get that far
But now I just ask for, the mathematics
Starts with the text then next the (?)
I joke around a lot
Is you down or not?
No you seen a bunch but let me show you what the don got

[Verse 2 :  Noelle Flores  & Astro ]

I hit my nigga Todd like this might be love at first sight
Hey, she represent the Bay like hyphy
She entice me with them (?) and them, tight jeans
Its like, genuine when you find something this good
You gotta stay close cos shawtys go go
She gorgeous
I love ir ehrn she stretch like (?)
When she near I cheer no frontin’ like porches
She call them shits selfies, I call them shits portraits
Cos you a work of art
Been tryna get your waters flowing
Since I peeked your ark, oops I mean your arch
Ha, I stay playin’ but don’t I make you laugh
You the baddest chick, from your scalp to your calfs
Girl, I know you heard me on the radio
True
I know you see me in the videos
True
Act like I’m wack on stage and be my boo
But ‘nough about me, tell me about me and you

[Verse 3 : Astro]

Now I can't sing…
But amma tell you right now…
That I know you like cooked food
Is said I know you like the Ox tail with the rice and peas on the side
And the, and the plantain gotta be fried
In the vegetable oil
And I might even let you eat off my plate
That’s real love, that’s real love
And they callin’ me the new Drake
Damn I think I made it
I think I made it
You so bad girl
Wouldn’t it be messed up if we were related
Wait damn, I can’t date you cos you my cousin
