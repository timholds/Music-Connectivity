I stare at my reflection in the mirror:
"And why am I doing this to myself?"
I'm losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
No, no, no, no, no...

Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars!
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
'Cause sometimes it's hard to follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are!
(who you are [x11])

Brushing my hair, do I look perfect?
I forgot what to do to fit the mold, yeah
The more I try the less it's working, yeah!
'Cause everything inside me screams
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...yeah

Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars!
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
'Cause Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart
But tears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising
There's nothing wrong with who you are!

Yes, no's, egos, fake shows, like WHOA!
Just go, and leave me alone!
Real talk, real life, good love, goodnight
With a smile, that's my home!
That's my home, no...

No, no, no, no, no...
Don't lose who you are in the blur of the stars!
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay...
Sometimes it's hard to follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing, everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are!
Yeah yeah yeah
