[Intro]
(Sirens, indecipherable radio chatter)

[Verse 1]
Waiting for the ambulance to come
Hoping that it doesn't come too late
Hearing the sirens in the distance
Hold on, help is on the way

[Chorus]
Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm right here beside her
And though I live, somehow I've found
Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm not a real survivor
Wishing that I was the one that wasn't gonna be here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore

[Verse 2]
Oh, we can't trade places
Our lives are strangely our own
Mr. Ambulance Driver, tell me
For everyone that dies, someone new is born

[Chorus]
Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm right here beside her
And though I live, somehow I've found
Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm not a real survivor
Wishing that I was the one that wasn't gonna be here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore

[Instrumental break]
(More sirens, indecipherable radio chatter)

[Chorus]
Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm right here beside her
And though I live, somehow I've found
Mr. Ambulance Driver
I'm not a real survivor
Wishing that I was the one that wasn't gonna be here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore
The one that isn't here anymore
