Oh beautiful love explain
Why you've entered my body again?
How could I forget
When the years have coiled up around my neck
Helpless and afraid
You used to think that I was brave
Now here is the shell
Here is the slave...
Are you waiting for the greatest escape of all
What do you search for with innocent eyes?
Are you waiting for the great escape
Or something more?

Try, try and find it
Pictures and scenes
All was well in our life of dreams
Then I awoke as you touch me, touch me
In love and proud
Forced to face fear as she cried aloud
That was the day
I cannot forget
This nightmare of mine
Has not left me yet...
Are you waiting for the greatest escape of all
What do you search for with, innocent eyes?
The great escape is near
The great escape is here...
