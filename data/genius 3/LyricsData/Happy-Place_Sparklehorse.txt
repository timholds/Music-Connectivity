Everyday
Held at bay
Lucy says

Here's a star
Here we are
In a car
Far away

Oh, why don't you
Go on and get in your
Happy place
Oh, why don't you
Go on and get in your
Happy place

Everyday
Makes sense
Lucy stay

It's easier
To beg to go
And run away
Far away

Oh, why don't you
Go on and get in your
Happy place
Oh, why don't you
Go on and get in your
Happy place

Everyday
It's okay
Lucy says
