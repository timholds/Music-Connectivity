Young man, go out
And take what's yours, don't doubt
There's strength in numbers, walk on
Defend the meek, headstrong

Now the story's become a bore
I don't want to hear it anymore
It's by no means an immaculate conception
Too many bodies lying around
Pushing daisies out the ground
And the church is cashing in on resurrection

Well I tried so hard to please you
'Cos I know that you crave blood
Consumer credit carnivores
And now the masses have been fed
Suck the offal from the dead
Now the joker's here to pick the sores

Under the flag

Under the flag boy
Under what flag?
