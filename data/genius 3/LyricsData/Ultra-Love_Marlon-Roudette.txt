[Verse 1]
How do I know that it's time, that it's real?
Tangerine skies over roads, over fields
We are fragile and brave
We all align the same
That's how I know that inside there's a steel

[Refrain]
Feels like I've been running forever
Now I'm where I belong
This love is an ultra love
And now I feel it coming together
To the sound of a beating drum
This love is an ultra love

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't let this, don't let this go away
How we're feeling, how we're feeling now, now
So don't let this, don't let this go away
How we're feeling, how we're feeling now, now

[Chorus]
Shoulder to shoulder, we gonna take this over
Breathe in, bringing us closer, up in here
And there's no way we gonna let this go away
Turn up and let us all sway
And we feel, ultra love in the air
Ultra love in the air
Ultra love in the air

[Verse 2]
Like I have known all these strangers for years
The voice in the wind blows away every fear
We are naive and bold, hero is a child you know
But all of our pain falls away now we're here

[Refrain]
Feels like I've been running forever
Now I'm where I belong
This love is an ultra love
And now I feel it coming together
To the sound of a beating drum
This love is an ultra love

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't let this, don't let this go away
How we're feeling, how we're feeling now, now
So don't let this, don't let this go away
How we're feeling, how we're feeling now, now

[Chorus]
Shoulder to shoulder, we gonna take this over
Breathe in, bringing us closer, up in here
And there's no way we gonna let this go away
Turn up and let us all sway
And we feel, ultra love in the air
Ultra love in the air
Ultra love in the air

[Bridge]
Don't let this, don't let this go away
How we're feeling, how we're feeling now

[Chorus]
Shoulder to shoulder, we gonna take this over
Breathe in, bringing us closer, up in here
And there's no way we gonna let this go away
Turn up and let us all sway
And we feel, ultra love in the air
Ultra love in the air
Ultra love in the air
