[Verse 1: Rita Ora]
In your eyes, I'm alive
Inside you're beautiful
Something so unusual in your eyes
I know I'm home (yeah)
Every tear, every fear
Gone with the thought of you
Changing what I thought I knew
I'll be yours for a thousand lives

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
I'm free as a bird when I'm flying in your cage
I'm diving in deep and I'm riding with no brakes
And I'm bleeding in love, you're swimming in my veins
You got me now

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't lookin' for love 'til I found you (oh na-na, ayy)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)

[Verse 2: Liam Payne]
Skin to skin
Breathe me in
Feeling your kiss on me
Lips are made of ecstasy
I'll be yours for a thousand lives (a thousand lights)

[Pre-Chorus: Liam Payne & Rita Ora]
I'm free as a bird when I'm flying in your cage (so lost)
I'm diving in deep and I'm riding with no brakes (no luck)
And I'm bleeding in love, you're swimming in my veins
You got me now (now)

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't lookin' for love 'til I found you (oh na-na, ayy)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't lookin' for love 'til I found you (oh na-na, ayy)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
I'm free as a bird when I'm flying in your cage
I'm diving in deep and I'm riding with no brakes
And I'm bleeding your love, you're swimming in my veins
You got me now

[Chorus: Liam Payne & Rita Ora & Both]
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you (Ooh na-na, ayy)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya (oh yeah)
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you
(Ooh na-na, ayy)
For love, 'til I found you (oh)

[Outro: Liam Payne & Rita Ora]
Wasn't lookin' for love 'til I found you (Ooh na-na, ayy)
For love 'til I found you (oh)
