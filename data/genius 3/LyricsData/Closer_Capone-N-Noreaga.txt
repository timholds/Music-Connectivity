Intro:
Word up word up always look in the sky yo. (Yeah I always did that too yo). And
Ask why. Why it gotta be like this?

Why do we have to struggle?

Kila Bee rest in peace yo (Killa Bee
Rest in peace)

Word up (word up) ? Prayers ain't never end (prayer's ain't
Never end)
"Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe"

*Noreaga*

Yo I started out in Iraq the wrong route
More chickens to doubt more money to count
Yo my Swiss account with more cheese amount
It's still piling and still gettin' calls from the island
Still do the things I do when I was wildin'
Tryin' to go from penny loafers to mink sofas
Spend a week with dime chickens that's freaks

*Hook*
If you don't know (if you don't know)
Knowlegde is what makes thugs grow
Just stay on point cause you reep what you sew

*Noreaga*
Yo ass cheeks scream loud like car beeps
I wanna be under the seats in our streets
Last year around the time this year
If I would of got locked Yo
I wouldn't even care
But now I got this rap thing (what)
No more hustlin' at age ten my team played to win
We're here to succeed
Sonny carson nobody understanding
Yo the black struggle gotta hustle to hustle
And once you get muscle nobody trust you
Tryin' to be like Goldy in the Shaft days
These lasts days comin' up
Yo these little niggas comin' up
Get their gun tucked ready to buck
Not thinkin'
Black on black crime yo it's swine you're both stinkin'
Pretty Ake yo Shan and Mobb Deep
Yo its Papi, officially arab nazi
2-5-2 we regluate this what

*Hook*
Said I wanna be closer to this paper (get close)
Ooooh get closer to these ends
"Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe"

Closer to this paper get closer to this paper (hella dope baby)
Get closer to these ends
"Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe"

*Noreaga*

Yo I remember when we first did it
Nobody with it
Label said 2-5 is too thugged out (to thugged out)
So although we had to but God wasn't glad to
Wait our turn to boil now we burn
On the daily done fuckin' in every telly
We can Fly just like R.Kelly
The moon is secondary to the sun
I think I gotta son but I ain't sure
What's in store, God there's more
Shortie says the kid mine knockin' at my door
Could it be? tryin' to be what I can be
Islami 2-5 my army
Said she about to have my seed
Soon to be it shocked me
Thinkin' bout a little me
Eternally I bleed thinkin' of seed yo at high speed
I multiply with weed
Now I slow my life down I got time to breath What?

*Outro*

Said I wanna be closer to this paper (get close)
Ooooh get closer to these ends
"Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe"
Closer to this paper get closer to this paper (hella dope baby)
Get closer to these ends
"Gotta get the cash gotta get the doe"
Closer to the end I want you I need you so muuuuuccchhhh

*Noreaga*

Shes the ill yo she made me forget I was in the booth and started listening yo
Thats deep right there
