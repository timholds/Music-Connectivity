[Verse 1]
I feel sort of hollow
And my head feels like a crowd
And I know you don’t mean to pretend
But you pretend anyway
So nothing will change

[Chorus]
Counting the ways you put yourself to sleep
And the days you put away for safe keeping
For maybe yes
For maybe no
Or just, maybe

[Bridge]
We’re still alive
I hear your kind words
And it’s some kind of miracle
It all sounds sort of hollow
All that’s better left unsaid
Won’t ever make it across our bed
If you close the distance
Then what opens?

What if all that’s never said
And all that’s in our heads
What if all that’s never said
Got said

[Chorus]
Counting the ways you put yourself to sleep
And the days you put away for safe keeping
For maybe yes
For maybe no
For maybe not or just
Or just maybe

[Outro]
For maybe yes
For maybe no
Or just maybe
Or just maybe
