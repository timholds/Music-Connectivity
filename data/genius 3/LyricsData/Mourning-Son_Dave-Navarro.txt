She gave herself to me
She's gone away from me
Where is the heartbeat coming from?
Lost is the heartbeat where I come from
Lie awake when the morning comes and I taste the fear
I can't live on the breath you take but I still feel you
Where is the heartbeat coming from?
Lost is the heartbeat where I come from

Say goodnight to the mourning son
I'll say goodbye to you sleeping one

Please don't leave if I don't trust you I'm alone for now
If I told you I was bottle-fed
Would you nurse me?
Where is the heartbeat coming from?
Lost is the heartbeat where I come from

Dreamer of the dream

Say goodnight to the mourning son
I'll say goodbye to you sleeping one
One day she'll die for you mourning son
One day I'll lie with you sleeping one
