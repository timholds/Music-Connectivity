[Verse 1: Kasland]
Can you kill a track with some feeling in the back
Some emotion in the beat with some rhythm Mr. Sacke
Don't be silly I'm on that got me filling up a pack
With some sentimental crap and a little bit of rap
Mix it with some rock and a little bit of Bach
No I'm playing no I'm not what I'm saying gon' be hot
Got me praying that I'm not in over my head
Let me know what I said when I'm old and I'm dead
I'm coming up quick with a vengeance, engines
Roaring up sick take attendance and it's
A couple thousand rappers who pretend its land is
Open to the rawest wrong so let's end this
I don't mean to say that you're never going to make it
But for your own sake don't pretend to and fake it
Man I can't take it I'm aching and shaking
To keep myself up, but this weight can't awake it

[Hook: Kasland & GrewSum]
Spit until the day I die
This is it in a minute I
Will destroy what I feel inside
No more feelings I'm offensive, why? I
Realize now what a beast I am
Blood dripping down my chin when I feast hot damn
I can entertain quick on a track no boredom
Even when I'm gone come back post mortem

[Verse 2: GrewSum]
I'm a track murderer cause I kill it like I do
Hunting mother fuckers then I cook them into stew
You don't want to be the one I have to do it to
Because there ain't no coming back from when I catch them and you're through
Donnie Darkflow in a pitch black room
Just thinking about the things that Imma have to do soon
Hating on me better switch that tune
Before you catch a body slam from Gorilla Monsoon
I'm a high profile rhyme and I'm all attacking you
High I tame mind frame when I'm blasting through
High off dank big thanks to who I got it through
High on pills show you what that oxy cotton do
Fuck rehab I don't want to go there
If I'm going to O.D. then I really don't care
Twenty seven years old right now that's perfect
Legendary status when I rap for certain

[Hook: Kasland & GrewSum]

[Verse 3: Kasland]
Hit one at a time when I'm hurting and I'm dying
Then I'm squirting out a line every turn of a dime
Then I'm learning how to rhyme and it's burning up my mind
But I'm certain that I'm fine oh what a burden of mine
What's that now? Don't be lurking to find
What you don't want to see there's a person inside
It's a curse you're beside what's the worst way to die
I'm thinking buried alive, I'm the first out of five

[GrewSum]
Get murked on the side of the road by a merciless guy
Put you deep in the earth as you cry
No returning to life once I work it insides with the mixer
Man it gets worse I can't lie
Close curtains and find you with worms in your eyes
Big furnace worth it to burn you alive
These verses are words from the stern and the pride
That are perfect the best that you've heard in your life

[Hook: Kasland & GrewSum]
