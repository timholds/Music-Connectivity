Jane says, I'm done with Sergio
He treat me like a rag doll
She hides the television
Says, I don't owe him nothin'
But if he come back again
Tell him wait right here for me
Or try again tomorrow"
I'm gonna kick tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow
Jane says, Have you seen my wig around?
I feel naked without it
She knows, they all want her to go
That's ok man, she don't like them anyway
Jane says, I'm going away to Spain
When I get my money saved
I'm gonna start tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow
I'm gonna kick tomorrow
Well she gets mad and she starts to cry
She takes a swing man, she can't hit
She don't mean no harm
She just don't know
What else to do about it
And Jane goes to the store at 8:00
She walks up on St. Andrews
She waits and gets her dinner there
She pulls her dinner from her pocket
Jane says, I ain't never been in love
I don't know what it is
She only knows if someone wants her
I want 'em if they want me
I only know they want me
She gets mad and she starts to cry
She takes a swing man, she can't hit
She don't mean no harm
She just don't know
What else to do about it
Jane says
