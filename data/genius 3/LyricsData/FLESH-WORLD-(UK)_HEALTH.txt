[Verse 1]
We're here
There's nothing else
We're not here to find ourselves
We're here
There's nothing else
We're not here to find ourselves
Follow your lust
There's no need for forgiveness
Do what you want
Don't hurt the ones you love

[Pre-Chorus]
All the bones grew strong before they broke
All the blood runs hot before it's cold
All the bones grew strong before they broke

[Chorus x2]
(We die)
All the bones grew strong before they broke
(So what?)
All the blood runs hot before it's cold
(We're here)
All the bones grew strong before they broke
(Let go)

[Verse 2]
We're here, there's nothing else
We're not here to find ourselves
In here, there's one way out
We're not here to find ourselves
Follow your lust
There's no-one here to judge us
Do all the drugs
We die, so what?

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Outro]
We die, so what?
We're here, let go
