The sun is down
I'm coming 'round
But I don't belong
In this part of town
So lead me high
Don't leave me low
And when I'm away
Lead me home

Any day now
You can save me
As I go up in flames
Any day now
Skies may open
But they'll wash me away

Give me one last try
Before you hang me out to dry
'Cause how can you be sure
That you won't need something that you can remember me by?

So many days
Away from home
Like some kind of freak
In a travelling show
Don't hold your breath
Or wait for me
I'm already gone
There's nobody here

Any day now
You can save me
As I go down in flames
Every way now
You deceive me
When you promise to stay

Give me one last try
Before you hang me out to dry
'Cause how can you be sure
That you won't need something that you can remember me by?

Something you need

Any day now
Any way at all
Any day now
Any way at all

Give me one last try
Before you hang me out to dry
'Cause how can you be sure
That you won't need something that you can remember me by?
