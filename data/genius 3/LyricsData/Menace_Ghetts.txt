[Verse 1: Ghetto]

I'm a force to be reckoned with
I'll state my thoughts on anyone's premises even if it's negative
I'll show you what a menace is
I do music, shot and still claim benefits
Gunshot specialist, long range hitting arch-nemesis
Niggas wanna know what my method is
No I ain't delicate, I'll bust my 'ting for the hell of it
I ain't gonna say I don't ever miss
I ain't O.T but I can be devilish call me a pessimist
I'll catch you on foot tryna' beg a lift
You wish you could fly like Pegasus
Don't think I do it to be credited
You think you're hard like a Megalith, I'm like a terrorist
I'll blow anyone up I ain't prejudice
You don't want B-Double-E-F I'll spray the C-S, thrown off on a Gilera VX
You wanna play games? play PS One
It's something like Vietnam
I'm a menace come out around tennish
Been doing this before bound for bound perished
When I was hungry you weren't even peckish
I was letting off pellets in the Chemist
I let the place blemish, these times I cherish
I'll bury a ferret on his own terrace

[Hook: Ghetto]

I'm a menace damn right I said it
I don't want credit feds come I leg it
Desperate times desperate measures
Run up on fellas' that came to drug sell us
I'm a menace damn right I said it
I don't want credit feds come I leg it
Desperate times desperate measures
Run up on fellas' that came to drug sell us

[Verse 2: Ghetto]

I'm a menace like 'O' Dog
I'll give your gran a benners for a blowjob
Another ten for her clothes off
She's stiff like a robot
But there ain't nothing I won't want
I'm just fucking about, but I'll bust in her mouth
And when I go soft? I'll send her back to the corner
Right next to the postbox, I'm a nasty piece of work
I might beat your bird, and leave her skirt with a whole heap of sperm
You probably think G's a perv, but I'm not I just need a nurse
Cause I'm that sick, but I ain't gotta hold girls captive
I'm an attractive young black kid, plus I do music still I'm on the road so I haven't adapted
I don't wanna mix the both, but when pricks provoke I just might put sticks to throats
See which one of you's missed the most, man'll watch me like there ain't chicks to scope
Screwface I'll be like fix your boat, why screw when I find you
Even if you have no fix, the road two moves: flick and poke
Two two's Here's a ghost, you lose I'll put the Iron in the niggas chest something like a boob tube

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Ghetto]

It's G-H I be on the grind
You better know I don't stop for a tea break
I might fail, cause I'm like L
I'm the nigga police hate, in each state
I've been a menace before I could pee straight (How Ironic?)
Cause I'm taking the piss now, you can put your life on it
I'm honest, ready to die like Wallace
If any you guys wan' it, why long it? I promise
I ain't doing it for a new Rewind topic
I ain't gonna get stripes from it I'm psychotic
When I've got a knife I don't care who's quite solid
I'll have you under your car like hydraulics
So what if your friends are hyper like Phonix
It's diabolic, I'll fire the rocket at the guy on my bonnet if it's me you try abolish
It's E-Double-T-O nigga peeps know I keep chrome in my jeans
I'm a target now that my boats on the screen so I can't slip until I own a machine
You're a halfwit if you're approaching my team, you'll be in a casket, not open to be seen
When I open fire, I'll bring down your whole empire and blow from the scene

[Hook]
