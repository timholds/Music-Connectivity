What if all the songs vain
And the dreams that I had never came and I had lost all the blessings I had gained?
Woke up in a world that was built upon pain
With an attitude like you ain't shit without fame
I'm quite gifted, with good hair and light skinned
A white pigment with a budget that's like spending
Infatuated with heaven although I like sinning
Say I'd never claim to be, but I'm quite Christian
To what extent would I go for ice wristes
Chain necklaces and overzealous bitches
Excuse my tone, yes I know the difference in a
Woman for self and a jazze belle
I ain't lost, I'm just speaking the truth
Some things I'd say even if I wasn't speaking to you
Jay said you gotta learn just to live with regrets
But what happens when regrets is all you got left?
Cuz you never got a fair chance
How can you waltz through life when it's a square dance?
And the leaders ain't leading, and the preaches sold out
Sitting in church like, "who's gonna save my soul now?"
They try to tell me that God ain't real
And a chain of big explosions is why I'm here
And a ape decided he wanted to walk upright
And leave the other apes in the jungle, cuz he that tight...you got me fucked up
I knew that shit could take flight
When my social studies teacher told me Egyptians were white
Not to be funny, might of seemed she was playing
But when I went to correct her, she believed what she saying
Kinda hard to give your all when you ain't inherit no cream
Parents broke now you feeling like the shit in your jeans
And life ain't shit like you see in your dreams
Percieved as a peasant but in your mind you stand as a king
Hating on the next man cuz he was a ruler
And overlooked your whole kingdom cuz he found him a jeweler
Queen with an ass, a couple cars with a dash
That functions with secret compartments for his pistol and cash
Trapped in the flash, you think the world at his feet
Cuz you serve the very plate of steak & shrimp that he eat
It was hard for you then, but it'll be hard in a month
Know the check you work for, we spent that much on lunch
Yea yea, you spend that much on bills
And hit your momma house when you can't buy your meals
Like, "Lord how we do dirt and live so fly?"
And you in church everyday but you just get by
And all you really ever wanted was a car and a crib
A little extra to buy something nice for your kids
But the life that you live is the only life that you know
Thanking God, with only hope for something better in store...this is my interpretation
And if you got more than a mil in your possession
What the fuck you know about a recession?
This is my interpretation
My interpretation
My opinion
