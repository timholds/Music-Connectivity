[Hook 1]
Here comes the money (Here we go, money, Uh)
Here comes the money
Money, Money, Money, Money
Money, Money, Money, Money

[Treach]
Ching Ching, Bling Bling, Cut the Chatter
You ain't talking money, then your talking don't matter
Ching Ching, Bling Bling, Pattin' Pockets
You make a dolla dolla, Can't a damn soul stop it
Shock it, Uhhh

[Vinnie]
Here comes the new kid on the block
Hold all your bets here's where the buck stops
See first of all I am steppin' out on my own
Bout time I elevated to claim my own thrown
Success in my blood, Call it home grown
Pores reakin' testosterone
Power and money got me crazy, cocky
No longer need you papi
I know your mad because you can't stop me
And if you wonder how this playa done scooped your honey
I think she smelled my cologne, It's called brand new money
Making major moves ain't a damn thing funny
Pimpin' hood rats and playboy bunnies
They see the..

[Hook 2]
Money, Money, Money, Money
Money, Money, Money, Money, Money
They Say Its
They Say Its
Money, Money, Money, Money
Money, Money, Money, Money, Money
Say What
Say What
Say What
Money, Money, Money, Money
Money, Money, Money, Money, Money

I'm global dolla dolla and roll with bout 50
Like to go out smelling fresh and lookin' spiffy
Don't like clean money, I want my riches to be filthy
Cause with everytime it's fun, I get done til I'm 60
So what am I supposed to do, Roll in two
Stand there pattin the pockets, 'Till I'm stackin' only two
Ching Ching, Bling Bling, Got the cash in lumps
It's a four wheel here to jack, And I'm selling them out my trunk
Whenever, whatever it takes to shake down a dolla
Although in that direction, wait a minute (holla holla)
All I wants to know, Where they go, Where they went
And I'm makin' monster money, smellin' just like a mint

[Hook]

If you can't see the money
Keep your eyes clean with visine
?????????? 7 digits ??????
Cheering, chilling, the best, never worst
Never get the pebbles but get the rocks first
Bank vaults are locked in
Ching! Ching!
We're mocking,I'm rocking
My family Christmas stockings are shocking
Fine women,any weather
Naughty denim and leather
?????? son they get better
Im one smart cookie
The vet that ????? rookies
??????
??????
Cash looks like I got a gang of fists in my pocket
