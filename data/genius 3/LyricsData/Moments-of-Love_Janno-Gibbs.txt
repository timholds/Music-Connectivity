Moments of love
Close beside you and the world from the light
All through the night
Its just you and me
Making music to the beat of our hearts
Lost in the stars
CHORUS
Moments of love (moments of love)
Bringing us closer together (bringing us closer together)
Sweet memories (sweet memories)
I know we'll remember forever (i know we'll remember together)
Moments of love (moments of love)
My lover my friend (my friend)
I can tell you all the things that i feel
All of this is real
Here in your arms (your arms)
I feel that i could just do everyhting
You've given me wings
Chorus
Faded photographs and letter signed i love you
Promises we made in care
And dreams that came true (dreams that came true)
Instrumental
And day after day
We fill our lives
With moments.. of love.. of love
Bringing us closer together (bringing us closer together)
Sweet memories (sweet memories)
I know we'll remember forever (i know we'll remember forever)
Moments of love (moments of love)
