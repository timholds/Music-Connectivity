[Verse 1]
There's a honky-tonk in Austin
Where the cowgirls like to go
Where the party's never over
The doors are never closed
There's a booth back in the corner
'Neath the Old Milwaukee sign
Where my heart's been broke
At least a dozen times

[Chorus]
Boots and diamonds, boots and diamonds
Where the best jukebox in Texas keeps 'em cryin'
If I said I'm not addicted, I'd be lyin'
Boots and diamonds, boots and diamonds

[Verse 2]
Lone Star blows like the Rio Grande
Jack Black pours like rain
The dance floor swings to a fiddle band
Lord, some things never change
No Dallas daddy's daughters
Bring his money out to play
'Cause Texas women
Always get their way

[Chorus]
Boots and diamonds, boots and diamonds
Hotter girls in denim cow town stylin'
A bunch of cowboys, whiskey high and social climbin'
Boots and diamonds, boots and diamonds

[Outro]
Where the best jukebox in Texas keeps 'em cryin'
If I said I'm not addicted, I'd be lyin'
Boots and diamonds, boots and diamonds
Boots and diamonds
