[ULLA]
When you got it, flaunt it
Step right up and strut your stuff
People tell you modesty's a virtue
But in the theatre modesty can hurt you
When you got it, flaunt it
Show your assets, let them know you're proud
Your goodies you must push
Stick out your chest, shake your tush
When you got it, shout it out loud

(spoken)
Now Ulla dance

(sung)
When you got it, show it
Put your hidden treasures on display
Violinists love to play an E-string
But audiences really love a G-string
Ven you got it, shout it!
Let the whole world hear vat you're about
Clothes may make the man
All a girl needs is a tan
When you got it, let it hang out

(spoken)
Remember when Ulla dance?

[MAX & LEO, spoken]
Yeah!

[ULLA]
Ulla dance again!

When I was just a little girl in Sveden
My thoughtful mother gave me this advice
If nature blesses you from top to bottom
Show that top to bottom, don't think twice

(spoken)
Now Ulla belt!

(sung)
Don't think twice!
When you got it, share it
Let the public feast upon your charms
People say that being prim is proper
But ev'ry showgirl knows that prim will stop her
When you got it, give it
Don't be selfish, give it all away
Don't be shy, be bold 'n' cute
Show the boys your birthday suit
When you got it, if you got it
Once you got it, shout out hooray!
