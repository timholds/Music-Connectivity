[Intro]
We wanna see your hands
We wanna see you dance
Like there is no tomorrow
We wanna hear a Yeah!
We wanna hear a No!
Now raise your hands and let's go!

[Strophe 1]
As soon as the night comes out
You getting dressed and leave the house
You call your friends
And get enqueued in the crowd
And as the haze will rise
You loose your seat belts for the flight
We bomb along and speed
Into the night

[Chorus]
We wanna see your hands
We wanna see you dance
Like there is no tomorrow
We wanna hear a Yeah!
We wanna hear a No!
Now raise your hands and let's go
Like there is no tomorrow!

[Strophe 2]
And in the break of dawn
When we will wake up with a yawn
We hit the road
To see you soon right on
And as the sun will fall
We hear you entering the hall
Cause friends do follow
When friends do call

[Chorus]

[Bridge (x2)]
We feel your love
We even love you more

[Chorus]
We wanna see your hands
We wanna see you dance
Like there is no tomorrow
We wanna hear a Yeah!
We wanna hear a No!
Now raise your hands and let's go (x3)

Like there is no tomorrow
You still can die tomorrow
