[Intro: Lupe Fiasco]
Immaculate mother of the holy soul
On behalf of the overdose
We come to you uncomfortable in our ways
Please don't slam the door all in my face

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Tried to go to church, church ain't work
Still want to kill niggas
Tried to go work, but work ain't work
Work ain't work for the feel nigga
Really make me feel like a field nigga
Make me feel worse, really tryna' chill
But inside I feel like a steel mill, nigga
And it's hard when these niggas steal mama
(What)
When you ainâ€™t got, got a meal still mama
Living off a meal deal mama
Can't stunt with them lil wheels mama
Need a real purse real heels mama
How dem liquors and them pills feel mama, lil mama

[Bridge 1: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
No man shall prosper
Lord knows if I said it, it's gospel, lil mama
Madonna (na-na-na)
No man shall prosper

[Bridge 2: Lupe Fiasco]
I be just trying make it

They be just trying break us

(Raise your hands up)
(And put your hands behind your head)

[Verse 2: Lupe FIasco]
White T on they shoulders
What drags em off through the streets
In the whip wit' they soldiers
Stations of the police
Trying to stick all this time to me
Trying to stick all these crimes to me
Could you just send a dime to me
Mama please send a sign to me
What's looking like life?
Is probation and a fine to me
Lawyer said I'd be alright
But I think that he lying to me
They really wanna throw those lines to me
Put me in a line, put the knives to me
Put me in the sky, put it to my side
Then push it inside of me

[Bridge 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Holy mother of the blessed soul
They don't love you there
They love you here
I love you like I'm Mexico
Say: (Santa Maria, Madre de Dios
Ruega por nosotros pecadores
Ahora y en la hora de nuestra muerte)
Amen

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
They sent them all to the slaughter
Baby mama, no father
He was hanging round them murderers
And them prostitutes and them robbers, yeah
Them dope fiends and that water, yeah
Wit' angel dust in they nostrils, yeah
They hit em up wit' that chopper
She was holdin' him, in her hands
Just like Stigmata, yeah

You gon' live here forever, yeah
Died like Ricky on his mama couch
Right there in his mama house
Only child, the holy mama's your mama now
