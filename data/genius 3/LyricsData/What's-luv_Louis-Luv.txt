[Intro: Louis Luv]
You told me you love me
Do you know me
You just wanna...
(Tell me you love me)

[Verse 1: Louis Luv]
You told me you love me
Do you know me?
You just wanna fuck me
Not even get to know me
You call me when you're lonely
Baby rolling my weed
She wanna be on my team
Bringing me this love like it's enough to buy me
Got me fucked up I can never waste my timing
All I wanna do is make money, get a time piece
Rolly on my wrist, baby don't you know I'm icy
You say that I'm nice and I think that's why they like me
Why they like me
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook: Louis Luv]
Always on my mind, it's you
Never wasting time, come through
Maybe when we're done, round two
Anything you want for you
Always on my mind, it's you
Never wasting time, come through
Maybe when we're done, round two
Anything you want for you

[Verse 2: Landon Cube]
Aww shorty what's love and what's lust?
That's all she ever want
What's love and what's lust?
Cause I wanna think you love me too
But I don't know who to trust
I don't know who to trust
You don't even know me
I think that you meant to
People say they know me
Don't know what I've been through
You don't even know me
I think that you meant to
I think that you meant to

[Hook: Louis Luv]
Always on my mind, it's you
Never wasting time, come through
Maybe when we're done, round two
Anything you want for you
Always on my mind, it's you
Never wasting time, come through
Maybe when we're done, round two
Anything you want for you
