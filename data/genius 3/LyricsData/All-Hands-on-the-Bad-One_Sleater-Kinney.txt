[Verse 1]
You can't get to heaven in a silver spoon
You can polish everything
Except for the mark on you

[Pre-Chorus]
Come be the first in line
(They call you out and up)
To shake the hand of mine
Come be the first in line
To shake the hand of

[Chorus]
All hands on the bad one, all hands on the bad one
We would be no better, we would be no better
All hands on the bad one, all hands on the bad one
We would be no better, we would be no better

[Verse 2]
You can't get to heaven in your Sunday best
When the night before they were calling it
Your cocktail dress

[Pre-Chorus]
Come be the first in line
(They call you out and up)
To shake the hand of mine
Come be the first in line
To shake the hand of

[Chorus]
All hands on the bad one, all hands on the bad one
We would be no better, we would be no better
All hands on the bad one, all hands on the bad one
We would be no better, we would be no better
All hands on the bad one, all hands on the bad one
We would be no better, we would be no better
All hands on the bad one

[Verse 3]
You can't get to heaven with a three chord song
They called you a sinner
But the people want to sing along
