Okay, boys, break's over. Let's take it from the top

[CONVICT #1, spoken]
This is good! Hey Bloom, put me in for ten grand

[MAX, CONVICTS]
Prisoners of love
Blue skies above
Can't keep our hearts in jail

[MAX, spoken]
Tempo, fellas!
Pick up the tempo!

Soon coming 'round with bail

[LEO, spoken]
Sing out, boys! Let 'em hear you in solitary!

[MAX, CONVICTS]
Oh, you can lock us up
And lose the key
But hearts in love
Are always free!
Prisoners of love
Blue skies above

[MAX, spoken]
Take it home, boys. We open in Leavenworth Saturday night

[CONVICTS]
'Cause we're still prisoners
We're still prisoners
We're still prisoners of love!

[PRISON GUARD enters]

[PRISON GUARD, spoken]
Hey, Bialystock, Bloom, Liebkind, good news! This just came from the governor: "Gentlemen, you are hereby granted a full pardon for having, through song and dance, brought joy and laughter into the hearts of every murderer, rapist and sex maniac in Sing Sing."
You're free!

[ALL]
Free!

[MAX]
Next stop, Broadway!

[CONVICTS]
But hearts in love are always free!

[LEO, MAX]
Leo and Max
Up off our backs
Back on the Great White Way!

Leo and Max
Back on our tracks
We're back on top to stay!

So when we take your money, never fear
We'll knock Broadway right on its ear

The cast is great, the script is swell
But this we're tellin' you, sirs
It's just no go, you got no show
Without the producers!

We'll never quit
Hit after hit

You and me-o
We guarantee-o
You're lookin' at Leo
And Max!!

[ALL]
The producers, Leo and Max!
