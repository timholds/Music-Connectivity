(feat. Case)

[Intro]
See
Niggas think this love stuff is easy
Heh, it's not the case

Fallin' in love is so easy
But stayin' that way is so hard
All she wanted was security
A man with a job and a car, baby
You'd think I oughtta be happy
On a hill with a view of the stars
But as soon as I had to go out of town for a week
I went to the next woman's arms

[1]
If I coulda seen it, inside her
Woulda seen her broken heart
I woulda held on, tighter
Then we wouldn't be falling apart
I shoulda said I love her
A thousand times a day
Then I wouldn't be sittin' here
Coulda, woulda, shoulda
My whole damn life away

Never had a good reason
For treating my lady that way
She cussed me out and left me standing there
And went to her girlfriend's to stay, baby
Now I spend all my lonely nights
Mentally tryin' to explain
Why she told me she never wanted to see me again
A year ago today

[Repeat 1]

In the morning, you know I coulda came back
Just before work and fooled around in the sack

In the afternoon, it woulda been so cool
Surprise you with ice, and set a date for next June

In the evening, shoulda loved you right
And let my niggas know I'm stayin' home tonight

I coulda, I woulda, I shoulda but now you're gone
But now you're gone

[Repeat 1]

Coulda, woulda
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I love you baby

Can I sing to ya baby?
Can I sing to ya?

Can I sing to ya baby?
Can I sing to ya?

[Repeat 1]
