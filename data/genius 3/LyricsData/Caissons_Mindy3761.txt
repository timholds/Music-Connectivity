Laugh at the pain from the world you gave me
The fell from all as a drifter watched on asking
Why did you choose me, why did you choose WE
I said I like your name, It's the name of the boat
The boat in the dock near the Apollo
Your name was safe...you weren't I suppose
But what to expect , what to expect?
In my fall ,THAT ONE in particular Of course!
It is America , from  the nightmares of my yester-years
To forever haunt me? You fuck babies and turn them
Into whoever that girl was, that girl you beat
That girl you drugged that girl you all wanted me to be
Til I couldn't find her. I run run run because when I stay
This is what happens. I become all that you are and worse
I beg for help and you turn away, just like that fall
That fall from a chair bare naked sick and raped
Guess that's what life requires to be reborn
Full
Exposure of oneself through the eyes of a mirror...YOU
And your...I haven't even started...
Karma served on a platter. Better than my head on a plate
But yours will all look lovely where ever they land, I'm sure
You live in the world of kick the can
Me
At least this time you laughed. I'm sorry were it better I cried?
No for you, you would all prefer my death
Me too
Oh the Humanity. And the Caissons  go Marching along
Carry On
