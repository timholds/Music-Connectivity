Astro – Verse 1]

Niggas use to pac Tecs
Now they move in packs with Text
Makin’ threats just to see how much likes they get
I swear I’m stressed
Fighting with these internet goons
The modern day killer is inside the computer room
When he board
Grab the keyboard
And think that he lord
Spam with hate
Just cos he can’t relate
Got a few subscribers
Now he think he a rider
Pop up in his city he a hider
Fuck ‘em tweet ‘em
Never trust him
His mamma didn’t love him
Spending life competing with all the comments above him
On every blog same username, his computer fame
Got his stock, nigga’s only hot when the record drop
Never had a wifey just Wi-Fi
Entertaining dumb
If it's wise, he's a wise guy
Kids don’t follow, like or remodel
Lanes with usernames giving digital swallows

[hook](x2)

Log ‘em in
Log ‘em out
Find a page
Run your mouth
…Nigga make way we dem internet goons
We the biggest on the blog but the smallest in the room

[Astro : Verse 2]

Now after assword and forget his password
And his life is deleted
New news feed new fetus needed
Block a nigga like ‘Beat it!’
Can't catch me on facebook and so he tweeted
He claim that he getting’ tired of me yo
Say I’m cocky and I’m wack but you follow me bro
Go and start a group chat going against the gat
Say the tribe ain't live and my moms look fat
Damn it’s like that? Guess so, it don’t affect me
Retards I don’t re-post you don’t respect me
Unverified niggas always tryna check me
Got a homie that know me that’s tryna cyber connect me G
We got beef so the I.P addressed me
With numbers and letters emojies and barettas
Let us, be friends to my internet fighters
Man’s tryna spam and chicks givin’ the virus

[Hook]

[Bridge](x2)

HEYY!
We dem internet goons
We the biggest on the blog but the smallest in the room
`Shit poppin’ under hot topic
I’ma diss your video and I ain't even watch it
Full signal
Ethernet cable
Thumbs down cos my home life ain't stable
Word to everything we can’t stand Astro
But we ca squash it right now for a follow back tho


…No
