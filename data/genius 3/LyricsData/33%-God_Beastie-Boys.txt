Can you feel it, can you feel it
I say get up, get up, get up, get up
Get up, get up, get up, get up, get up
Get down
I know, I know, I know
I know you're going to dig this
It's the joint
Whooooo...who's car it that
Wait a minute

Get down
Just like this

Is your name Michael Diamond?
Wohoohaa...yeah
G-g-g-get down
