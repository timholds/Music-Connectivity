[Intro]
Kritikal production shorty
Multi alumni, hit that studio baby
Hood fame, what up wildin'
Its goin' down baby
All the way from the M.I crooked letter
Crooked letter to that [?] key my nigga
Keep your ear to the streets shorty

[Hook:]
Yeah I'm [?] clean, Yeah I'm gettin' paid
When I'm gettin' mine, forever in a day
He ain't know, ya dealin' with a vet bitch
And He ain't know, ya dealin with a vet bitch
Ya I gotta yellow, and I'm on them things
When I'm gettin' change, forever in a day
He ain't know, ya dealin' with a vet bitch
And He ain't know, ya dealin with a vet bitch

[Verse 1:]
And Krizzle got it from the door I keep it on smash
Run up on your block like nigga this is my slab
Hey I'm a hustler I keep it real for all my street niggas
If I ain't got it I know where I can get it for cheap niggas
I'm just a beat maker shorty I ain't hustle since
They trying to say this cr-crack epidemic's evidence
Hey they just just mad because the [?] still supplies the streets
But now I made the [?] rally crack in the [?]
Hey I'm a beast for real mama somethin' like a killer
Just to let you know don't stand to close or I [?] triggers
Hey I'm a drank sipper baby you can pop the skittles
I don't wanna be a nigga, I just wanna hit some new
I'm fly in the wrist rollin' on them things dog
Don't worry bout' me pimpin' just focus on your game dog
Keep it cool little nigga, now don't play hard
Don't think them [?] won't pull up on your front yard

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
Hey I'm a spokesperson sales meanin' all that
Hit the mall "like that right there?" give me all that
And what you call that?
Shit thats a power player
Do it like big cuz, catch a flat then throw the car away
I been official since official was official
Been blowin' swishes with niggas that [?] and missiles
Waved em' by all of the niggas that didn't believe in me
On the jet to the check like "ho look at all the scenery"
While these bars got me nigga this is hood fame
While these bars got me nigga this is hood fame
While these bars got me nigga this is hood fame
Know where [?], we do hood things
Grip them wood grain, on some 23's
Missisipi where a nigga can [?] at 10 a ki
Young Krizzle I never do what the others do
He ain't true to himself, so how the hood s'posed to fuck with you?
I'm well known where I go and where I rest
But they ain't even know, your dealin' with a vet
