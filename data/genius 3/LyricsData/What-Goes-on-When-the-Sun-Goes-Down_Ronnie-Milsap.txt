Sometimes love can sure get lost in the daytime
And working eight long hours you're only a picture in my mind
But when we're finally alone in each other's arms our love is found
And only lovers know what goes on when the sun goes down
What goes on when the sun goes down
Pillow talking love tangled sheets and cotton gowns
What goes on when the sun goes down
Makes the every day life of two people in love go round
Every morning with love renewed we face another day
Screen doors banging the boss complaining and bills to pay
Through it all we wear love's smile from the happiness we've found
And only lovers know what goes on when the sun goes down
What goes on when the sun goes down...
What goes on when the sun goes down...
Makes the every day life of two people in love go round
