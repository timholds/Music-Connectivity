Intro
Make up sex
That’s what we are doing
Girl whats next
We are always getting into it

Verse I
You know why I came to see you
You don’t take my calls
And you won’t return my pages
I am yelling cause you are creaming
Should I just pull out?
These words can be misleading
You scratch my back
But its not a fight
We finished arguing much earlier tonight
What we’re doing now
Is what people do
Seems like we’re ending it
But we’re just having

Chorus
Make up sex
That’s what we are doing
Girl what’s next
We are always getting into it

Verse II
Hush hush girl, neighbors can hear us
It’s too much noise
(we gotta keep it down)
Sometimes harsh words come between us
But it’s ok, cause it’s a heated moment
Ow!
But its not a fight
We finished arguing much earlier tonight
What we’re doing now
Is what people do
Seems like we’re ending it
But we’re just having

Repeat chorus 2X

Bridge
I want you, I need you, we’re having, make up sex
We break up, and we make up, we’re having, make up
Sex when I touch you, and I tease you, just to please you
Make up sex when we make love, after making up, bout
To tear it up ooh!
