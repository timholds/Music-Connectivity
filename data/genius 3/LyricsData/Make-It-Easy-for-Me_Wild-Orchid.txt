Promise me that if you leave
You won't be coming back again
It hurts to see your face when you look at me that way
Don't try to take me in your arms
'Cause I don't think that I could find the strength
To let you go, and leave me here alone

I need to break the ties that keep on breaking my heart
Not gonna hang on to the strings you tore apart

So make it easy for me, if you ever loved me
The hardest thing I'll ever do is say goodbye
Still loving you
So make it easy for me, if you ever loved me
Turn around and walk away
'Cause we've run out of words to say

You promised me our love would be
A fairy tale that everyone would wish for in their dreams
Well, where's my happy ending
Memories play in my mind, frame by frame
I see it all
Unfold before my eyes
How could I have been so blind

I need to break the ties that keep on breaking my heart
Not gonna hang on to the strings you tore apart

So make it easy for me, if you ever loved me
The hardest thing I'll ever do is say goodbye
Still loving you
So make it easy for me, if you ever loved me
Turn around and walk away
'Cause we've run out of words to say

Say you're sorry to me a million times
But that will never ease the pain
That I feel right now inside
You can try and make it better
But no matter what you do, you took away forever
When you told me we were through

Chorus
