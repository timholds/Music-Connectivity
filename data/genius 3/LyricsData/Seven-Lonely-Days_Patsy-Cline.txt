[Verse 1]
Seven lonely days make one lonely week
Seven lonely nights make one lonely me
Ever since the time you told me we were through
Seven lonely days I cried and I cried for you

[Chorus]
Oh, my darling you're crying, boo-hoo-hoo-hoo
There's no use in denying I cried for you
It was your favourite pastime, making me blue
Last week was the last time I cried for you

[Verse 2]
Seven hankies blue I filled with my tears
Seven letters, too, I filled with my fears
Guess it never pays to make your lover blue
Seven lonely days I cried and I cried for you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Last week was the last time I cried for you
