[Intro: Lil Duke]
Yea L.A., smoke the good weed, ya dig?

[Hook: Lil Duke]
Hard work pays off
Hell, we don't get no days off
Knock 'em right off and go hide in the loft
I had to come up, make myself a boss
Everyday hustling like I'm Rick Ross
Ferrari kit you could hit it, it's off
Believing in God, I iced out the cross
Got choppers on choppers you better not cross
I got [?] on [?]
Hit 'em up then we gon' pay for the cost
Thottie, she don't give a fuck what it costs
Nigga we winning, we do not take loss
Got a couple bad bitches in Boston
She like to suck it right out of me
I keep it on me like I hit the lottery
I came from nothing, I grew up in poverty

[Verse 1: Lil Duke]
I came from nothing, I was dead broke
Prices get cheaper when they come on boat
My bitch is so bad, she like it in her throat
Givenchy all white, I'm dressing like the Pope
My bitches on greenlight, them bitches on go
White bitches snorting the coke
I never seen a bitch there when I go
We on the road and we selling out shows
Told you before that it's bros over hoes
Got me a drink and I pour up a four
Roll in the back was so fat that I choke
I'm a young boss, I'm in L.A. with loads
I don't talk two-faced, you listen too slow
Baby come fuck me and suck me and go
She suck on that dick like a muh'fucking pro
She like my demeanor, pull up in a ghost
Counting up racks and checks everyday
She said she like my style in every way
You want a feature, then you got to pay
You ain't talking money, you out of place
Got a new Uzi, I'll blow you to space
Pay for that case and just throw it away
Right at them puppet, we toting them K
Stack up that money to see better days

[Hook: Lil Duke]
Hard work pays off
Hell, we don't get no days off
Knock 'em right off and go hide in the loft
I had to come up, make myself a boss
Everyday hustling like I'm Rick Ross
Ferrari [?] you could hit it, it's off
Believing in God, I iced out the cross
Got choppers on choppers you better not cross
I got [?] on [?]
Hit 'em up then we gon' pay for the cost
Thottie, she don't give a fuck what it costs
Nigga we winning, we do not take loss
Got a couple bad bitches in Boston
She like to suck it right out of me
I keep it on me like I hit the lottery
I came from nothing, I grew up in poverty

[Verse 2: Nechie]
Nechie shining, see the diamond glisten
Hit a nigga with a stolen glizzy
32 shot let it pop out the Glock
Hop out that drop and I pop at yo' top
I take up yo' block, [?]
Fuck a scale, nigga buy a bale
I just bought my nigga out of jail
He caught a body, he ain't fucking tell
Had me water, yeah I need a well
Bought the foreign just to fishtail
Forgiato, yeah they blowing kisses
Skrrt skrrt, on you monkey bitches
Banana clip for you monkey niggas
All my shooters, yeah they Reggie Miller
I just flooded me another bezel
Diamonds singing like they Bryson Tiller
Hard work, bitch, hard work
Make her suck it 'till her jaw hurt
Shoot the glizzy 'till my palm hurt
Catch you lacking, you gon' hit the dirt
I just made a 50 off of merch
I just made a 50 off of percs
I done made a 50 off of lean
I'm a motherfucking trap king
