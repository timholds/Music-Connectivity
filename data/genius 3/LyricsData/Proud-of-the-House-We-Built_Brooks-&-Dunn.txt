[Verse 1]
I dropped to my knees in that field on your daddy's farm
Asked you to marry me, all I had to give was my heart
While other kids went diving into swimming holes
You and me dove off into the great unknown
We were barely getting by, taking care of each other
Then I became a daddy; you became a mother
Was an uphill battle nearly every day
Looking back I wouldn't have it any other way

[Chorus]
I'm proud of the house we built
It's stronger than sticks, stones, and steel
It's not a big place sitting up high on some hill
A lot of things will come and go but love never will
Oh, I'm proud
I'm proud of the house we built

[Verse 2]
Still working our way through the land of milk and honey
At the end of the day there's always more bills than money
I close my eyes at night and I still feel
The same fire in my heart I felt out in that field

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Oh, look at us today
Oh, we've come such a long long way

[Chorus][x2]
