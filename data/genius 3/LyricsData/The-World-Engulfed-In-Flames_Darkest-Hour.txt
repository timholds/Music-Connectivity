Lie awake
It's all give and take
Wretched place that you've never known
As you've made your way
Through the cemetery
Of mistakes that you've never made
Debts that you've never paid

Most precious waste
You could never throw away
Just one more taste
You're never gonna stray

Welcome to your fix
When you thought you had kicked
Some things just never go away
Ingrained though hazy as memories fade
Save those ones that you've never made

Most precious waste
You could never throw away
Just one more taste
And you're never gonna stray

We are what you have made
The world engulfed in flames
And I'm no modern man
This is no modern land

Give me your process
Your pathetic progress
Bury me in the ultimate tomb
Give me your process
Your pathetic progress
A posthumous prosthetic womb

Not a second too late
As you storm the gates
With the force of a thousand
Blood rush to your head
Gives you strength
That you've never had

Most precious waste
You could never throw away
Just one more taste
And you're never gonna stray

We are what you have made
The world engulfed in flames
And I'm no modern man
This is no modern land
