I understand when you talk and there is not a cause to dumb it down again
And I beseech you to finally be teaching me all of your rules again
And far out in front nothing is sublime and behind me
All of the ground has given way and just like yesterday I'm the lonely boy
Babe I wanna be involved
Babe I wanna be involved with something I can use now
Oh show me
I wish there was a rhythm it could bring back every character
And make them dance up on their toes just like they used to
Down at the Purrumbete hall with the confetti all covering up the floor
Her funeral song was already chosen under the milky way
Babe I wanna be involved
Babe I wanna be involved
Babe I wanna be involved
Babe I wanna be involved with something I can use now
Oh show me
Do they like boys with child bearing hips?
