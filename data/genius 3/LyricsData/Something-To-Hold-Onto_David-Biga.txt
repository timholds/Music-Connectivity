[Verse 1: David Biga]

I didn't want to change my mind
I think my mind saved my life
I think my mind changed its mind
I hold on to moments and moments hold space n time
I wonder if moments can feel time
It seems out of line
Cause we have nothing to hold onto
Cause each moments passes
A broken hour glass broken into ashes
And the ashes consist of you
Flashing lights of the moments we've been through
How could you?
Do this after all we did
I hate thinking about this n
That song that I made
Memories that I laid
Pavement forever paved
I'm trying hard but I'm..


[Hook: Lauren Aquilina]

Trying too hard to put a smile on my face
When it feels so out of place
Im being frozen by your flames
Thought you were human but you're just a ghost
A shield of skin and bones
I promise you won't feel a thing

[Verse 2: David Biga]

Not gonna lie
When I heard the news
I kinda contemplated the same thing you did dude
Not that I'd do it
But the idea of no pain feels like freedom
The best memories we've had repeated
You're the one free were here to deal with the pain
Pain has started to make us feel strange
Like everyones looking a certain way
It's not my fault I know how to beat up a page
In the darkest moments of rage
My homies we one in the same
Don't be so quick to judge cause we quick to punch n shove
Better bet we were born into muddy stuff
And we miss you bruv
And you're with us dawg
We feel an Angels touch
Sent from something above
A blunt n a brew
Ain't nothing for all we've done dude
You lied to me you told me we wouldn't feel nothing
I won't let them control me
Ain't no puppet attached to strings
I'm trying hard but I'm..

[Hook: Lauren Aquilina]

Trying too hard to put a smile on my face
When it feels so out of place
Im being frozen by your flames
Thought you were human but you're just a ghost
A shield of skin and bones
I promise you won't feel a thing

[Outro: David Biga]

And I go blind
Thinking about memories all time
Too young to feel like this
Because I'm

[Hook: Lauren Aquilina]

Trying too hard to put a smile on my face
When it feels so out of place
Im being frozen by your flames
Thought you were human but you're just a ghost
A shield of skin and bones
I promise you won't feel a thing
