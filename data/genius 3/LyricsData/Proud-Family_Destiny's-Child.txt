You and me we'll always be tight
Family every single day and night
Even when you start acting like a fool
You know I'm loving every single thing you do
I know that I can always be myself
Around you more than anybody else
And every day as I'm heading out to school
You know there's no one I love as much as you

Chorus
Family, a family, proud family
They'll make you scream, they make you wanna sing
It's a family thing, a family,proud proud family, proud family
They'll push your buttons, and wanna make you wanna hug'em
Its a family thing, a family, proud proud family

Sleep tight knowin' that you're there
And when I dream you're everywhere
Everywhere, in my heart and even in my soul
You know I take you every single place I go
Everyday I'm hangin' with my friends
That's cool but when the day ends
I wanna feel the love that I know is really true
I only wanna feel how I feel when I'm with you

Chorus

You and me we'll always be tight
Family every single day and night
Even when you start acting like a fool
You know I'm loving every single thing you do
I know that I can always be myself
Around you more than anybody else
And every day as I'm heading out to school
You know there's no one I love as much as you

Chorus
