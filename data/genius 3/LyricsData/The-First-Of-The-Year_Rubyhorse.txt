Just a year away
And nothing stays the same
But the rain and the gray you wake up to
And you try
In the only way you know to cover it up
Words give it all away
When there's nothing to say

I know it's hard
To let it all go
Outgrow the colors, the shades
Some, they might say I'm raining on my own parade

The first holiday
And I don't want to stay
And I don't know where I'm going home to
It's all change
And I'm still insane
I'm walking on water in shoes that can't stop the rain
Going under again

I know it's hard
To let it all go
Outgrow the colors, the shades
Some, they might say I'm raining on my own parade

But I'm just a kid
Trying to unchange all the hits and the misses
I can't explain, I thought that I could
All kinds of angels with my blood to spill
From the first of the year
