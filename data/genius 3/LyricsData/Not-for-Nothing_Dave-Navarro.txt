Not for nothing
Starfucker yeah
Not for nothing
Starfucker
Not for nothing
Starfucker baby
Move your stuff in
Happiness ends
How can you miss me when I'm here with you?
Miss the person you thought that I would turn into
How can you say you miss the small things?
Every night I try to show a small thing to you

Not for nothing
Starfucker yeah
Not for nothing
Starfucker
Not for nothing
Starfucker baby
Move your stuff in
Happiness ends

How can you miss me when I'm here with you?
Miss the person you thought that I would turn into
How can you say you miss the small things?
Take my .38 and push it inside of you

Used to be the things you loved about me
Now they sicken you when you're around me
Things my friends all seem to love about me

Not for nothing
Starfucker yeah
Not for nothing
Starfucker
Not for nothing
Starfucker baby
Move your stuff in
Happiness ends

How can you miss me when I'm here with you?
Miss the person you thought that I would turn into
And when you're moving closer to me
I pretend that you're the person you used to be
