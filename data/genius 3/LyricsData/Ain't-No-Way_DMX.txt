[Hook - DMX]
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my flow
Ain't no way ya niggas you just don't know
But niggas is about to go oh no oh no
Ain't no way you're gonna stop my shine
Ain't no way you niggas wanna stop mine
Ya niggas must be out yo mind, I don't know why

What the fuck is you niggas pressin me for
I saw more ass than a ho and you stressin the raw
If I was testin your jaw, maybe then you would respect me
But you can't respect me cuz you dont even know me
Nigga check me (come on)
I'm that motherfucker that'll put you to sleep, while you sleepin
Red dot from a hundred feet, you just knew you was creepin
Bad decisions lead to last decisions
Fast collision, now yo ass is missin (what)
Take it over there now you bring it back to the streets
Have you forgotten what it means when a dog shows his teeth?
Let me break it down for you he's about to attack you
Still standin here faggot? You must want me to smack you
You ain't been there or done that, fuck is y'all niggas tellin me
I'm the only nigga, walkin the streets with four felonies
But peep this, I see shit is hard, niggas is strugglin
Leave rap alone for a little while, go back to hustlin

[Hook]

Give it to niggas just how they give it to, me
Hit em in a rhyme because I'm a MC
Been a lot of places most niggas won't, see
That's why I'm at a level that y'all niggas won't, be
Let your man hold somethin now he want, more
You ain't no fuckin killer what was the front, for
It was a time when the world was at your front, door
Now they change places niggas want, raw
Niggas laugh at me and was mad at me
Cuz the way life was goin had to be a, tragedy
But after me, it's over, I'mma take the whole verse
I'm tryin to keep it real that's why I let y'all niggas go first
But you looked a gift horse right in the mouth
Didn't appreciate what you got when you got it
So if I see it, I'mma dot it, where to hide it
You gotta car better drive it the fuck up outta here
And hope and pray I don't pull up alongside it
COME ON

[Hook]

Niggas don't know so I gotta flip
It seem they've forgotten how dark it could get
Barks like a pit scratch when I hit
We both know you pussy but you stay talkin shit
What I'mma have to do dog, run up in yo mess
Catch you while you comfortable put one up in yo chest
One up in yo vest, of course they the hollows
You goin' away today, you just lost tomorrow
I'mma go platinum (nah) you gots to be kiddin WHY
Make it double platinum, no bullshittin
And I'mma stay flippin flows, rippin shows
Strippin ho's, gettin dough let me go
And nigaz know, who the best is
The dog, DMX is the rest is or might as well be helpless
I wreck this cuz when I wreck shit
I might snatch a niggas necklace
Then go from like midnight to breakfast
COME ON

[Hook]
