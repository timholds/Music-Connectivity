Oh, the summer time is coming
And the trees are sweetly blooming
And the wild mountain thyme
Grows around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie, will you go?

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie, go?

I will build my love a bower
By yon clear and crystal fountain
And all around the bower
I'll pile flowers from the mountain

If my true love, she won't have me

I will surely find another
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the blooming heather

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie, go?

And we'll all go together
To pull wild mountain thyme
All around the purple heather
Will you go, lassie, go?
Will you go, lassie, go?
Will you go, lassie, go?
