[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I been down since day one, yeah
I'm the only one that's been right here
Why you acting like you don't care?
I been down since day one

[Pre-Hook]
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you, don't get it confused
Boy you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
Why you acting like that?
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
(Why you acting like that?)
Why you acting like that?
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
When I leave I'm taking off

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
Baddest bitch in the world right here
You ain't even gotta go no where
Boy you better watch the way you walk
Cause if you trip you're gonna fall, oh!

[Pre-Hook]
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you, don't get it confused
Boy you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
Why you acting like that?
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
(Why you acting like that?)
Why you acting like that?
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
When I leave I'm taking off

[Verse 3: Iggy Azalea]
Well shit, she ain't me
My love cost too baby, ain't nothing free
Check my angle, daddy, you could call me angel, daddy
Uh, but you gon' turn your beauty right into a beast
Now, this is the business or pleasure, let's keep 'em separate
I ain't tryna be second, just for the record
See you slippin' you trippin' just thought I should let you know
I admire your effort but I need better love
See many men try to play me 'til they get scared away
Told 'em that's a fall, try out another day
This is different, now I'm seeing that it isn't
Promise I'm not gon' cry here like Mary J
Now ain't that funny, that you was something special 'til
I noticed that you just like these losers who come in severals
But I, know that if you leave you comin' right back
So my question boy is, why you acting like that?

[Pre-Hook]
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Been down for you, don't get it confused
Boy you could lose your turn
Don't let the tables turn
Don't let the bridges burn
Cause everything could change in a matter of days
Depending if you've learned

[Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
Why you acting like that?
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
(Why you acting like that?)
Why you acting like that?
You gon' miss me when I'm gone
Why you acting like that?
When I leave I'm taking off
