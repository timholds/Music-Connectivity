Big clouds rolling by
Taking up space round the corner of an eye
No great friendly sky
No radio news now wherever i drive

Tennis from heaven, keep falling on purpose
Hit the right houses, well all join the circus

And you need

Clouds rolling by
Clouds rolling by
Clouds rolling by

Good boys in demand
Soldiers of fortune, some groomed in the sand
Theyre all part of a plan
Practice for years get to do what you can

Girls on the ground boys wanna go high
You shut up and learn and you might get to fly

And you need

Clouds rolling by
Clouds rolling by
Clouds rolling by

What would you do
What if they came out for me and you
And how fast can you run
Cowards like me, would i pick up a gun

Join in the struggle
Among chosen few
When theres too many
When there is nothing new

(Its good)
