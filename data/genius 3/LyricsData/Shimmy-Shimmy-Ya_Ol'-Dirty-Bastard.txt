[Hook]
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raw
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it ra

[Verse 1]
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon-voyage
Yeah from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on your college-ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta put the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill
Now chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground
For any emcee in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam my flow is like bam
Jump on stage ah then I dip down
(I like the way you talk)

[Hook]
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it rawww
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raww
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it rawww
Ooh, baby, I like it raw
Yeah, baby, I like it raww

[Verse 1]
Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Gimme the mic so I can take it away
Off on a natural charge, bon-voyage
Yeah from the home of the Dodger Brooklyn squad
Wu-Tang killer bees on a swarm
Rain on your college-ass disco dorm
For you to even touch my skill
You gotta put the one killer bee and he ain't gonna kill
Now chop that down, pass it all around
Lyrics get hard quick cement to the ground
For any emcee in any fifty-two states
I get psycho killer, Norman Bates
My producer slam, I was like bam!
Jump on stage ah then I dip down

Shi-shimmy shimmy ya, yeah
Shi-shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam
Shi-shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shi-shi shimmy shimmy ya shimmy yam, shimmy yay
Shi-shimmy shi-shimmy ya shimmy yam, shimmy yay

Give me the mic so I can take it away, shimmy shimmy ya


[Verse 2: additional extended verse]
See, when a nigga say he likes it raw
Keepin' it dirty, down to the floor
See my name is the ODB and I'll beat your ass
For the ladies who know me tell them who the fuck I be
For the niggas who know me tell them who the fuck I be
My style comes down on ya'll like rocks
(Sitin' on the dock of the bay) By the dock!
(Aiyaiyaiyaiyaiyaiyaiy...) Umm by the flock
(Don't goooooo) By the creak by the flock
Got east coast locked down padlocked
My Zoo be all all down by the flock

[Hook]
Ooh, baby, I like it raw

Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay

Yo, ya'll know the lyrics, come on, sing with me
