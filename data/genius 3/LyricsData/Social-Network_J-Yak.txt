It feels like... everyone's grown up/
My mom told me itd happen, and rappin's so much... to no avail, no product/
Or... nothing to brag about, im draggin out/
Dope lyricism, but they'd rather hear em spitting Swag me out, swag me out/
Who's in my social network? Tag me now/
I'm tryna make rap that could make me proud, Jay-Z "wow", and Shake break me down, I hate these clowns/
Tryna rate me, lately, J seems down... and sounds... depressed with this/
Those the burdens of a pessimist, urgin for the rest to strap their vests, protect their necks, and wrists/
It's a cold world... but I'm dressed for this, I never claimed I'm the best, I just accepted it/
Like good credit, I would head for the books, steady minded, but I'm all to aware that school is blinding/
So is timing... i've seen love change overnight, seen drugs sway sober sight, like....let the instruments hit/
And I never said that I'm above the influence, I just influence it, we spend more time defining legit/
Then finding out niche, quick as a whip, life can change, so just stick to the script, kid/

I'm codependent to an old dimension, the one I won't let go/
The whole "yo, its time to grow" but im so retro, in retrospect/
I'm calling for an SOS... 300 miles from the civilization/
Trials of a tribulation, waitin on some syndication, let's go check/
Electrotech's switching his brain chemistry, the energy/
Drained from his face, replaced identity; capital one/
Light cast from his sun, could catalyze and analyze what you done/
Tryna make it in a place embracing statues of some.. lady, a bell that we tried to break/
A hell that we tried escaping... just to find out that its chasing/
The only means of avoidance is through embracing complacence/
Defaced currency, and emergencies, divert beliefs/
Paul will tell you bout it curtains 33/
It's so ominous, the false promises, spotting up all of us/
Enough to bluff an optometrist, hidden in ganja hits/
That's the old me, I say that i've changed/
Or was it evolution, ever proving, that I'm the same/
I just look different, and I don't wanna social network it just looks distant/

Dear Summer, Where's autumn gone?/
My City's been replaced by waste from an atomic bomb../
Ambiance is stranger.. closet of coat hangers/
Bottles with no fragrance, this place I couldn't wait to scape from/
I felt held back... by memories of the culdesac/
We huddled at...then they yell "jack"/
I hear em from a distance/
I ran away after the egg had hit that honda civic/
A little kid too unaware about the world I lived in/
A little kid too unaware about the world i'd live in/
I'd give anything to go back/
To the railroad tracks, snowballs packed, and basketball plaques/
I lacked fear, stress, and reality/
I owned life, love, the whole galaxy/
Never knew of fatality til my gramps died/
The same year, followed the other one, from my dad's side/
Started asking if the past life's concering/
Or determines if youll end in the black night and burning/
"Don't ask twice" its hurting, my mom said/
Inverted my conscience, reworded a third of what I had not yet/
Been answered, see theres crime, dimes, and cancer/
No nine lives to tamper, divine cries for a candle, to flicker/
Or something to switch up, so I can know that he's with us/
And bearing a witness, to the most trying times ive been mixed up, in/
The dim backdrop, and windy road of a matchbox/
In front, settles, my need for a stunt devil, ill slack off/
Moscoto, a lotto ticket, and crack rocks/
The facts not, that im scared of failing, its opposite/
The knowledge I could polish the world I know is a postulate/
For why I'm 'fraid to drop this shit, apprehension/
The greatest ill in our inner mind, and the reason for half our lessons/
What we shoulda done, what we coulda done/
What we woulda, it'd be gooda, if our hoods were onn/
And our mind's gone, wrap insecurities in the blunt/
But know you'll still have residue every time that you lick it up/
We'll pick it up where you left off, they wait for the pep talk/
Bout bettering life, and right when you set off/
The devils on your shoulder, holding you accoutable/
And saying that you'll always be the same, your not dis-mountable/
Your sins are countable, your bound to go, a couple rounds or so/
It's far from over, turn your life around, I swear its manageable/
