J Rice - Pray Let It Snow Lyrics

Send "Pray Let It Snow" Ringtone to your Cell
I just can't sleep tonight
Knowing that things ain't right
It's in the papers, it's on the tv
It's everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don't have a home

And I know there's sunshine behind that rain
And I know there's good times behind that pain
Can you tell me how I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day (Let it snow)
I close my eyes and I pray (Let it snow)
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin' (Let it snow)
So let it snow... (Let it snow)

I Pray... it's another Christmas holiday
When the schildren sing
Let the angels bring any present that they need
We got a thing can't let it slip away
Now outside it's raining so I pray

I know there's sunshine behind that rain
I know there's good times behind that pain
Tell me how I can make a change

I close my eyes and I can see a better day (Let it snow)
I close my eyes and pray (Let it snow)
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin' (Let it snow)
I close my eyes and...

Pray For the broken-hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all the ones not breathing
I pray for all the souls in need
I pray. Can you give 'em one today

I just can't sleep tonight (tonight)
Someone tell me how to make a change?

I close my eyes and I can see a better day (Let it snow)
I close my eyes and pray (Let it snow)
Outside it's cold but the fire's blazin' (Let it snow)
I close my eyes I pray (Let it snow)
I pray (Let it snow)
And I pray...

I close my eyes and I pray
