[Verse 1: Olu]
I mean what I say so you know my word is bomb
But what I'm bout to say, I hope that you don't take it wrong
Keep me inside you even if you chose to move it on
I'm not sure how to say this so I just wrote a song
I'm reminiscing on the time we used to spend together
Wasn't forever, but in it you know I never ever
Let you go, I kept on holding, always gave you passion
Cause with you that I could say that I was truly happy
And to be honest its something by how you looking at me
I'm gonna miss it, but I know that you'll be good without me
But you can shine with the clouds are the only thing I see
So what I came here to tell you, its kinda hard for me
Keep your peace up and just hold it tightly
I hope you still get the warm feeling on the coldest nights
And never leave me in the past, just keep me on your mind
You're everything I was trying to find, but at the wrong time
Right?

[Hook]
I'm still alive, but I'm barely breathing
Just praying to a god that I don't believe in
Cause I got time while she got freedom
Cause when a heart breaks, no it don't break even

[Interlude: Olu]
We got each others feelings
They're feelings we never felt
I hate to break it to you
I'm think I'm bad for your health
Don't wanna break your heart
But I that know this isn't real
And we've fallen too deep
So I'm saving you from myself

[Verse 1: Olu]
I must be trippin'
I swear could feel it slippin'
You give me half of your heart, 
And you think I don't know the difference
But that's what happens overtime people grow apart
I'm grounded with your picture on my mind
Work of art
I still think about you
But just not as much
You had me down and out
Now I'm getting up
And to the new nigga you get with
I just wish him luck
Cause he'll never be half of the man that I forever was
Because I used to put your smile over everything
I thought the end of you and me would be the end of me
Something about you just gave me some sort of energy
Thought it was love
But I guess it was just some over thing
Because I don't look at you the same way you look at me
But all the memories we had are what you took from me
Time flew by
But now it's safe to say I know
That I gotta let you go

CHORUS
I'm still alive but I'm barely breathing
Just praying to a god that I don't believe in
Cause I got time
While she got freedom
Cause when a heart breaks no it don't break even

INTERLUDE 
We got each other feeling some feelings we never felt
I hate to break it to you
I'm thinking I'm bad for your health
Don't wanna break your heart
But I know that this isn't real
And we've fallen to deep so I'm saving you from myself
