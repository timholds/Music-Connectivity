Dead stars in jewelry boxes spill as we rush past them, lain to waste
We can’t have everything we want, some things will have to stay
There is no beauty in the fire but there is beauty in the way your eyes locked willingly with death and death turned trembling away
Like ice on passing comets we move coldly, soundless, through it all but in the wordless space between us there is something like a song
Each note exists within the silence, our hearts were moving it along
You sing the melody so perfect; I can only get it wrong

So I beg, just make the silence stop (it’s exposed too much)
I think I’ve had enough (time to let it go)
It’s always quiet and that was the sound of us (and it’s killing me, I’m close to giving up)

An hourglass is spinning, tumbling right past me through the room
Gravity long since gone, now an airless tomb
The song that lived between us: here but out of tune
The grains of sand escape the glass, each one paler than the moon
Entire planets empty with only dust and rocks to find
You escaped from here, leaving this behind
You found an enemy in sorrow; I made a lover out of mine
And now I’m running out of air and I’m begging

Just make the silence stop (it’s exposed too much)
I think I’ve had enough (time to let it go)
It’s always quiet and that was the sound of us (And it’s killing me, I’m close to giving up)

What am I to say? We’ve been growing apart
My infatuation with you began to slip into the void
I watched it drift into the cosmos as anguish plagued my mind
As we began to mirror all the space between the stars, I couldn’t take the static
I needed something more

It wasn’t easy finding something to live for, hearing your voice inside of every sound
I saw a part of you in everything, took a moment to breathe, then let it run out

Just make the silence stop (it’s exposed too much)
I think I’ve had enough (time to let it go)
It’s always quiet and that was the sound of us (And it’s killing me, I’m close to giving up)
