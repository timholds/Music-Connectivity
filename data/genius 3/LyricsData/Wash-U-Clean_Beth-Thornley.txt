(*Beth Thornley)
U run it rich, that carburetor*
U gotta open, open that choke
‘Cause when you’re here, the air it won’t clear
And u just blowin’, just blowin’ smoke
U got a blue feather bird on a golden swing
It wears a ruby tipped crown but it don’t sing
U keep bringin’ me gifts like it ain’t no thing
But I thought u said goodbye
I thought u let; let that bird fly. (there it goes)
Baby, I can’t wash you clean
U got a match, well I got the gasoline
Baby, redemption ain’t free
U gonna need more than u can get from me
This river’s dry. Baby, can’t wash u clean
U gotta a new monkey bangin’ some tambourine
It’s got some big button eyes; it’s made of velveteen
U just want me to know u got all you need
But am I OK alone?
Cause here’s a monkey
If I need company; (nice monkey)
U comin’ over like u was clover
I’m gonna cut it with my lawnmower
U knockin’ at my, my door all tangled
Your guilty conscience wrapped ‘round your ankles
I see you draggin’ it ‘cross my floor now
U feelin’ better. I’m feelin’, I’m feelin’ worse now
