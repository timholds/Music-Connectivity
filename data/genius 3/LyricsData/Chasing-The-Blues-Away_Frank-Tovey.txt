Aphrodite caught the train
Down to London town
She thought that it was all
Happening there
But now she's hanging out
Around King's Cross station
Trying just to make the return fare

Chasing the blues away
Chasing the blue away

Years ago eros gave up
Using his bow
The arrows lie rusting in their quiver
Now he sits by the embankment
With his nose in a paper bag
Watching his dreams
Float down the river

Chasing the blues away
Chasing the blues away

Everybody's saying look at me
I need media coverage
Film stars and politicians
Run to the curtain call
And i must confess to dipping
My toes in those crashing airwaves
Cos if you haven't seen it on TV
It hasn't happened at all

Chasing the blues away
Chasing the blues away

If you sit here long enough
The whole world passes by
Or that's what they would like
You to believe
Well if you only take from life
What is offered in a box
Then you will inevitably
Be deceived

Chasing the blues away
Chasing the blues away
