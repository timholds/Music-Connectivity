When it all comes down around us
You are nowhere to be seen
But I'm just happy you could make it
Cause it's my favourite time of year

And maybe this time around
Your going to hang on and stick it out
Do you think they'll remember just who we are?

And if I don't wake up in heaven
And just stumble 'round this lonely place
If you stay until tomorrow
I won't be bitter either way

I feel no mercy from the heavens
And my heart is worn away
I've lost my voice now, it doesn't matter
No-ones listening anyway

But next time they come around
And drag their circus back into town
We'll free all, we'll free all the animals

And if I don't wake up in heaven
And just stumble 'round this lonely place
If you stay until tomorrow
I won't be bitter either way
