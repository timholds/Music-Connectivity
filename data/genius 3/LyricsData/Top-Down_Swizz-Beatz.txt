[Intro]
Swizzy!
Can you say "New York City"?
Can you say "New York City"?
Can you say "New York City"?
If you not from New York, well

Wherever you are (Shine!)
Whoever you are (Shine!)
Wherever you are (Shine!)
Whoever you are (Shine!)
Wherever you are (Shine!)
Whoever you are (Shine!)

Hey, hey, I told ya

[Hook]
Ridin' with my top down, and my jewelry on
Hey, I'm just getting my hood on
I'm just, I'm just, doing my thing
I'm just, I'm just, (pimp) doing my thing
Hey (yup) hey (yup) hey (yup) hey
I said I'm ridin' with my top down, and my jewelry on
Hey, I'm just getting my hood on

[Verse 1]
I'm in the hood bouncin', spray it like a fountain
Money like a mountain, tell me why you're poutin'
I know why you're poutin', because we getting paper
Hey, tell 'em again, Swizzy, we getting that paper
I'm in the hood, top down, with my jewelry on me
With security on me, I got my goons on me
I get 'em off me, I shake them haters off me
DJ, get 'em off me, I shake them haters off me
Niggas is you with me? My bitches is you with me?
If you got a problem, then sucker come and get me
Y'all know my name
You see the candy paint, it spell my name, Swizzy

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
It's like bump, bump, bump, bump, bump
You know the block is bumpin'
Fiends on the corner, man, you know the block is bumpin'
Speakers in your trunk, shit thumpin'
They playing my song, people is jumpin'
Now, we got a little block party, y'all
And there ain't nothing but Henny and Bacardi, y'all
Sitting on a stoop, on a milk crate
How you living life? Fucker say "Great!"
How many of y'all come from nothin' into somethin'?
Why these niggas hating? Why these niggas frontin'?
We just ridin' with our tops down
Niggas acting like somebody got shot now

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
This chick said "Swizz, I wanna ride in your Viper."
I said "Hell nah, don't you know that's a Spyker?
Number two out of only 20 in the world
You sit in my seat, it'll change your world
I'm fresh to death, like a million bucks
Threw on my Louie hat, with my fucking Gucci chucks
Stepped out the Benz, that bitch said "Oh no!"
I said "Easy chick, you know I gotta go."

[Hook]

[Outro]
Wherever you are (Shine!)
Whoever you are (Shine!)
Wherever you are (Shine!)
Whoever you are (Shine!)
Wherever you are (Shine!)
Whoever you are (Shine!)
