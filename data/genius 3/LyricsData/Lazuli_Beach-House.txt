[Verse 1]
In the blue of this life
Where it ends in the night
When you couldn’t see
You would come for me

[Verse 2]
Wonder eyes, motion high
And we don’t dare slip on by
Make us suffer
Like no other

[Chorus]
Is nothing like lapis lazuli
Let it go back to me

[Outro]
Like no other you can’t be replaced
(Is nothing like lapis lazuli)
