In a house up the hill
Lays a boy, he's sleeping still
And the time's creeping by
Till the world prepares to die
Then again out of dust
Will arise what ended last
And the boy will awake
Give his dream a little brake

And the story now goes on and on and on
As the old has died the new arises
And a child will

Light the universe
Light the universe
We got blind, we can't read the signs
Light the universe
Light the universe
We don't find what's hidden in the mind

Under sand in a sea
Covered with eternity
Beats a heart with no fame
Quietly whispering my name
When my time has run out
I will hear it very loud
Telling tales I once knew
But forgot by losing you

And the story... has gone... on and on and on
As the old has died the new arises
And a boy will

Light the universe
Light the universe
We got blind, we can't read the signs
Light the universe
Light the universe
We don't find what's hidden in the mind
