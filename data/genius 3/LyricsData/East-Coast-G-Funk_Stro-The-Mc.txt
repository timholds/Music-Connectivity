[Verse 1: Astro]

Yo I need a chick like Pam Grier
That let me slam rear
Every day of the damn year
More backside than backtalk
I'm bout mine
Your punchlines I outlines
Get outlined in chalk
When you come to New York
Who the god? Me
We know if rap's kung fu
I'm passed Bruce so sharp
I get Lee's mad like Tarantinos
You slaves never let your chain go
Keep flashing
Life's a movie
Tell the groupies we casting
But only for a short period I hit
Calmer than your grandma
Still leave n*ggas delirious
King we need you
Here he is in pure form
Drop bombs be it songs or Vietnam
I dont need validation or verification
Forget Twitter checks send a check
Better yet observe the unheard
Yall cats ain't spitters
You spit turd
Y'all weird and thats word

[Hook: Astro]

With the G-funk, he funk, she funk, we funk
(Follow me, follow me
Listen to the words I deliver) [3x]
I come down with the wickedness
One rude boy coming with the darkness

[Verse 2: Astro]

I'm confident you cons dont walk conflict
Bars like the convict
I come sick, you comic
Lmao, you owe pay stro
A$AP American cash
(We dont take pesos)
Mad cause they can't hold A
Say I'm an A-hole
Gangsta walk, seen?
Get some B-Roll
She can front but she know
She want to roll with the best
No stress
I got more hoes than protests
Uh wait I mean power to the people
My homie Troy Ave screaming powder to the people
I see you
My lyrical high baggie's lethal
Don't same my name in vain
That sh*t's illegal, too late
Red stripe, red stripe on the corner
I'm tryna leave the country
Just to fornicate a foreigner
Before I step in the booth I should inform ya
I make studios my diner don't be acting like Broner
