Down in the Hole (Tom Waits) 4:53

When you walk through the garden
You gotta watch your back
I beg your pardon
Walk the straight and narrow path

Now if you walk with Jesus
He's gonna save your soul
You got to keep the Devil
Way down in the hole

He's got the fire and the fury
At his command
You don't have to worry
When your holding Jesus' hand

We'll all be safe from Satan
When the thunder rolls
You got to keep the Devil
Way down in the hole

All the Angels sing
'Bout Jesus' mighty sword
They shield you with their wings
Keep you close to the Lord

Don't heed to temptation
For his hands are so cold
You got to help me keep the Devil
Way down in the hold

Down in the hole
Down in the hole
Down in the hole
Down in the hole

You got to help me keep the Devil
Down in the hole
Help me keep the Devil
Way down in the hole

Help me!
Help me!
V You have to help me
You got to help me
Ah, help me keep the Devil
Down in the hole
Help me keep the Devil
Way down in the hole
