[Mikill Pane: Verse 1]
I was always lyrically awesome
Then I got part of the word of the Lorde and reached biblical proportions
I'm still of no particular importance
My lineage will draw paupers
So you'll never have my picture on your saucers
I'll never be a royal and I'll never marry one
But, Ever since my boyhood I've respected marijuana
Now I've found the link I think I've finally had the answer
I'll announce on twitter that I might be Harry's father
Joke, I've accepted that I was born a peasant
That's the day I learnt life's most important lesson
Usually I played the fool I did as I was taught though
I only ever reigned to rule the Brits at an award show
Fuck a palace that does not appeal to me
I'm at home in Hackney and I'm never leaving it readily
We might not know exactly what we'll be
But we know exactly what we'll never be
(And we'll never be)

[Hook: Lorde]
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of lux' just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler), you can call me Queen Bee
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule...)
Let me live that fantasy

[Mikill Pane: Verse 2]
You might get a wave when you see me out
Hopefully I'm well known in New Zealand now
But if I step into a room I don't expect to see you bow
My dentist's who I choose if I ever need a crown
The papers haven't made news of my recent sins
Living up to certain standards would ruin my evenin'
I wanted to write anthems, do it right and people sing
So I formed a plot and stuck to it like Steven King
So I guess I came pretty close to being King
Like Albert but I don't do penis rings
There are no important chairs in my home
I don't wear Nike's on the loo so they'll be no talk of Airs to the throne
I might be only average but I'll stop being mean
The only palace job I'll ever need is a jester
We, might not know exactly what we'll be
But we know exactly what we'll never be
(And we'll never be)

[Hook: Lorde]

[Bridge]
(Oooh ooooh ohhh)
We're bigger than we ever dreamed, and I'm in love with being queen
(Oooooh ooooh ohhhhh)
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

[Hook: Lorde]
