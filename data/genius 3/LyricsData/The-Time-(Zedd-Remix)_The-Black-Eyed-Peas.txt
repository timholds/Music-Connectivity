[Hook: will.i.am & Fergie]
I, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you

And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you-you

[Verse 1: will.i.am]
I-I came up in here to rock
Light a fire, make it hot
I don't wanna take no pictures
I just wanna take some shots
So come on, let's goooo
Let's lose control
Let's do it all night
'Til we can't do it no mo
People rockin to the sound
Turn it up and watch it pound
We gon' rock it to the top
Until the roof come burnin' down
Yeah, it's hot in hurrrr
The temperaturrrre
Has got these ladies
Gettin freaky-urrrr

[Verse 2: Fergie]
I got freaky freaky baby

If you didn't know that
Well baby now you know nowwww

[Hook: will.i.am & Fergie]
I, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you

Ohh I've, had, the time of my life
And I never felt this way before
And I swear, this is true
And I owe it all to you-you
