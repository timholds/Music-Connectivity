It wasn't what you said
It's knowin' what you mean
You wanna spread your wings and fly
Where the moment takes you off
Tryin' hard to be , someone you ain't

It wasn't how you laughed
That taught me how to cry
Convincin' me your heart is
A million dreams away
Tryin' hard to be , someone you ain't

You came along when I was down
And found a place within me
All the love I ever had can not
Replace the things you did
I'm still in love with you and
Even though you're gone
I gotta try , gotta try 
Gotta try , gotta try

Someday I'm gonna win
And get back to your arms
And here am I alone
With a memory of you
Tryin' hard to be , someone I ain't

We held it in , we gave it out
There wasn't any quarter
All the pieces fell apart
It still ain't like it ought to be
I'm still in love with you
Even though you're gone
I gotta try , gotta try 
Gotta try , gotta try

You came along when I was down
And found a place within me
All the love I ever had can not
Replace the things you did
I'm still in love with you
Even though you're gone
I gotta try , gotta try
Gotta try , gotta try

We held it in , we gave it out
There wasn't any quarter
All the pieces fell apart
It still ain't like it ought to be
I'm still in love with you
Even though you're gone
I gotta try , gotta try 
Gotta try , gotta try
