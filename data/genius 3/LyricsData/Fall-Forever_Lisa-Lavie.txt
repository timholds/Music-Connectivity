[Verse 1]
Tell me where to go from here
I'm lost tonight
Everytime I turn around I cry
It seems like darkness follows me both day and night
Nothing left to give but still I fight
What's the reason for all this insanity
I feel like giving up yeah
I can't believe this is happening, happening to me

[Chorus]
Nowhere to turn
Nowhere at all
Trying to take a step back
Stumble and I fall
Is it gonna be like this forever
Is there a rainbow after the weather
It never goes, it never leaves
Should I keep praying
Should I believe
Is it gonna be like this forever
Is there a rainbow after the weather

[Verse 2]
Teardrops are surrounding me as I wake up
Sometimes I wish I didn't wake at all
And now there's barely a shimmer
Keeps getting dimmer
It's a battle, there's a war
There's gotta be a winner
Get up on my feet cause I got two
I can't lose
I won't lose, won't lose, no
What's the reason for all this insanity
I feel like giving up yeah
I can't believe this is happening to me

[Chorus]
Nowhere to turn
Nowhere at all
Trying to take a step back
Stumble and I fall
Is it gonna be like this forever
Is there a rainbow after the weather
It never goes, it never leaves
Should I keep praying
Should I believe
Is it gonna be like this forever
Is there a rainbow after the weather

[Bridge]
No gravity hold
Forever I fall, is it gonna get better
I keep falling forever, forever
No gravity hold
Forever I fall, is it gonna get better
I keep falling forever, forever

[Chorus]
Nowhere to turn
Nowhere at all
Trying to take a step back
Stumble and I fall
Is it gonna be like this forever
Is there a rainbow after the weather
It never goes, it never leaves
Should I keep praying
Should I believe
Is it gonna be like this forever
Is there a rainbow after the weather
