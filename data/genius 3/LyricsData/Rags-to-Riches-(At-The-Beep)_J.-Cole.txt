Damn, broke as a bad joke... but still I laugh though
Frontin' trynna have hope, it's sad though
I'm tired of being broke as shit
I'm seeing other niggas ball and I'm like 0 for 6
Ay man I just graduated, good old college degree
Shit, my niggas drug dealing see more dollars than me
I know my calling, it's in my blood to do this music thang
Won't be that illest nigga that you never knew his name
I'm looking at these fake A&R's like "you a lame-
That boy a genius and you ain't even listen, man you insane"
But you'll see though, just what the hell a nigga 'bout to be though
So give me one year then play this back like TiVo
Cause boy I'm finna blow - I'm a mothafucking torpedo
The music's in my blood so watch these niggas turn mosquitoe
Uh, I play the villain and the hero, some grow man shit
Feel like a goddamn kid, man I'm Pac and Big (What up?)
"Up" is something that I can't give
Won't see me disappear like the old Ant Viv'
Cause even on a slow jam I'm so damn sick
Man I even spread a virus to a program-quick
I gotta focus on my flow and get some dough, man, shit
No dollars got me acting like I got no damn sense
But peace to my broham's and to my ex-lady
Yea we've been complicating things with the sex lately
Maybe I'm being selfish - but, naw, I can't help it
Cause girl we go back like a throwback Celtics - Jersey
Regardless of where God lead us
Just know that I was Martin and you was my Gina
But I'm through living in the past Lord
No more thinking rewind and more fast forward
Less rearview mirror and more dashboard
I'm visualizing cash and stamps on a passport
That CLS with a full tank of gas for it
Cop my momma a whip, nigga, and she ain't even ask for it
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle
Wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle
Said I'm wise enough to know that money can't buy you happiness or lovers
But it's gon get my momma out the struggle, nigga...

I'd like to welcome ya'll to
My life, my life, my life, my life, in the sunshine...
