[Chorus: Rottin' Razkals]
Frustration, how do I release the pain?
Frustration, got a brother goin' insane
Frustration, do what we must to maintain
Frustration, everybody feels the same

[Verse 1: Fam]
Where will I go? Who would I see? What will I say?
When and if I get to Heaven or if I even go that way
I don't know, who calls the shots, who says it starts and it stops
What's what and what's not
Not me, not you, not I, not who
Not a member of the Double I crew
Take the second letter off frustration
And now I wanna fuss with everybody in the nation
Everybody feels the same
Puffizm, everybody's goin' insane
Racism, everybody feels the pain
But as for me, I do what I must to maintain

[Chorus: Rottin' Razkals]
Frustration, how do I release the pain?
Frustration, got a brother goin' insane
Frustration, do what we must to maintain
Frustration, everybody feels the same

[Verse 2: Chap]
To our release, is there ever a time when I'm at my peace?
Be it West or East Coast, our devotion promotes
My life to Hip Hop for the heart provokes, the one that totes
Issuin heat, givin' they enemies a choke
We ain't a hate cult, we got love but hate for those
Who traumatize, sodomize, crook-a-delics in disguise
I'm in a state of frustrate, now I saw my friend
Ain't know when, just say I'm goin' all out cos I ain't givin' in
To my frustration with my frustration
To my frustration with my....

[Chorus: Rottin' Razkals]
Frustration, how do I release the pain?
Frustration, got a brother goin' insane
Frustration, do what we must to maintain
Frustration, everybody feels the same

[Verse 3: ?Fam?]
Frustration, how many ways does it hit us?
Racism, poverty and plenty brothers put in prison
Real niggas come from the days before the childhood of my grandpa
Despise another top of the boat for the blackness wanted
And crime across the nation, parents basin', minds are wasted
Disgrace and temptation, no one's involved with education
The limits exceed to live longer than a life span
Man, you take out a chance and advance from.....

Chorus

[Verse 4: Diesel]
4:20 in the morning, I ain't gettin' no sleep
Go problems in my head and the shit is gettin' deep
How a nigga like me gonna make it as a rapper
Just a thief of the bricks that been in and out the slammer
Now I gots to fit in with some type of role models
I used to sling coke out of glass and plastic bottles
Always had loot off of robbin' other niggas
These finger signin' autographs, used to pullin' triggers
"Stay out of this shit" is what my niggas keep yellin'
I ain't got no loot so ain't no way in hell in tellin'
Waitin' on time gettin' touchy and shit
Even snappin' on some niggas and throwin' nervous fits
When I was a crook, I ain't had problems like this
Cos I was in it for self and I ain't really give a shit

[Chorus x2: Rottin' Razkals]
Frustration, how do I release the pain?
Frustration, got a brother goin' insane
Frustration, do what we must to maintain
Frustration, everybody feels the same
