Yo, look I'm kickin to fight deliver this could it get rid of your life
It's midnights, I'm rippin it once, it's hittin you twice
Ghost deliver it nice so take it as a present
F*ck sittin in college, I kick this knowledge for the lesson
It burns ya chest, the words are blessed, confuse and bring ya questions
Cause with my complexion, a finger nail can cut the tension
And in case I didn't mention spittin it better than anyone did it before
I'm rippin your corpes, dippin and lettin you live in the morgues
Shit in the porsche. trick or treat I'm here to piss on the floors
And if I didn't come with the whip I'm gettin in yours
On devils night we come to bless this track
