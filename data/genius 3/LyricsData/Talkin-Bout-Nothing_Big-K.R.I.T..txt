[Big K.R.I.T.]
Ever since I was a young'n, up in my grandmomma house
Watchin "The Mack", recitin it back, like, "Boy, whatchu talkin 'bout?"
Droppin a switch, hittin a lick, tryna get rich, off in this bitch
Droppin my top, I'm poppin my trunk, I'm whippin my wheel like I'm whippin my grits
These niggas ain't shit, these niggas ain't real, these niggas is frauds
Most these haters been cuffin, crushin, lovin all on they broads
So I pull up car, slam a do', break a hoe, down
Run her throat 'til it's sore, pass that hoe 'round
They say, "Hold up.. Damn K.R.I.T. that's fucked up!," I know it
They say, "Hold up.. Damn, K.R.I.T. let's po' up," I fo' it
I-I-I, I'm feelin good, feelin great, how are you?
So much bass when I pop my tape, cain't feel my face, can you feel yours too?
I +Got This+ here, I +Got This+ here, might have to chop that up
Her pussy wet, she swab the dick, might have to mop that up
She say, "What's haapnin? I'm tryna fuck", might have to prop that up
Bop that up, cock that up, don't act all shocked, bitch slop that up

[Chorus]
I-I-I need that... I want that...
I'm 'bout that... what's haapnin?
I seen that... I bought that...
I own that... I'm snappin
Y'all niggas ain't talkin bout nothing!
(Not a thang, not a-not a thang, hoe)
Y'all niggas ain't talkin bout nothing!
(Not a thang, not a-not a thang, hoe)
Y'all niggas ain't talkin bout nothing!
(Not a thang, not a-not a thang, hoe)
Y'all niggas ain't talkin bout nothing
That I cain't do, that you done done that I ain't did

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Ain't nobody trippin on yo' hoe, ain't into that
Ain't nobody trippin on yo' hoe, I give her back
Cut her slack, let her go, cause she was in the V-I
Ain't like I be askin fo' attention when I be out
So much tip that I cain't see y'all stressin busses with they feet out
If you ain't suckin or fuckin (well...) you should keep out
Shoot the kind of bill, when they bus' it gotta be bi
She ain't gotta beg, if she lookin I can see
'bout on they G-I, drop yo' t-top, haters tend to leave out
The bottles servin, poppin, shawty look at all that we got
Look at all that we on, tell them floaters be gone
FUCK wutchu been talkin 'bout? The couch I put my feet on
Ain't no love for these haters, ain't no love for these fakes (WHAT)
I was born in the country, I ain't trippin on snake (WHAT)
I was fishin for some bitches, all I ever had was bait
If you thank you got a problem with it, tell it to my face

[Chorus]
BISH~!!
