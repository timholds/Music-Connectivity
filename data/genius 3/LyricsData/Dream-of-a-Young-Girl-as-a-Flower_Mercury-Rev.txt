In the green grass a young girl dreams
She's like a flower in the field, well in my dream, you are real
Whatever happens now they say is whatever we choose
Under bright stars a young boy dreams
He's walking on the moon, in my dream we are too
And whatever happens now they say is whatever we choose

In the hot sun a young cat dreams
Of night and making love, well in my dream we are too
And whatever happens now I'll leave it all up to you

She's a flower in the field

You're the one that everyone leans on
You're the one that can't lose control
Your toes in the sand, inches from throwing yourself
In the sea but you can't
You're the one that everyone leans on
You're the one that can't lose control
Whatever you want and whatever you choose
What happens now is up to you
