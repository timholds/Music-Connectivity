[Verse 1]
I thought we would always be together
The love we shared was gonna last forever
Once I was your one and only
Now here I sit, Mister Lonely

[Chorus]
He'll hold you tonight, but I won't
What's he got that I don't
The one thing I thought I'd never lose
He's got you

[Verse 2]
Beneath this dark cloud you left me under
Can't sort it out so I'll sit and wonder
Tell myself, "It hurts, don't it"
Now my empty heart will be forever haunted

[Chorus]
He'll hold you tonight, but I won't
What's he got that I don't
The one thing I thought I'd never lose
He's got you

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
He'll hold you tonight, but I won't
What's he got that I don't
The one thing I thought I'd never lose
He's got you

[Outro]
He's got you
