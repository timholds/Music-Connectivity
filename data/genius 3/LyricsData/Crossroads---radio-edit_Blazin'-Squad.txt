Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone
Bone, Bone, Bone
So tell me what ya gonna do
When there ain't nowhere to run
When judgement comes for you
When judgement comes for you
So tell me what ya gonna do
There ain‘t no place to hide
When judgement comes for you
Cos it‘s gonna come for you

See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads
See you at the crossroads, crossroads, crossroads

So why you gotta go and pray
You're gonna make it some day
You got a job
So why you want a raise
Why you wanna act tough
Why can't you play
This whole fame thing
Just comes one of these days
And when it comes
You'll be one of a kind
But before this
Keep all this in your mind
Cos I will hold you
To the end of the line
Want all this
You'll be mad to decline

So what you gonna do
When everyday's the same
Try and do this shush
Just for a glimpse of fame
Didn't mean to do it
Just put yourself to shame
Didn't want to kill her
Just tryin' to play the game
When you reach the crossroads
Where you gonna go
Go with your conscience
Just let your feelings flow
Life's up life's down
But things can turn around
Innocent or guilty
You will soon be found

So what your gonna do when people hate you
Chat beat you they dont like you
Can't run away coz they will find you
Praying for answers what you gonna do
Make decisions where u gonna go
Take the crossroads go with the flow
You gotta cum eazy and then u gotta let go
Ur living in a hateful world keep low

(Breakdown)
Mmmm and we pray
And we pray
And we pray
And we pray
Everyday, everyday
Everyday, everyday
And we pray
And we pray
And we pray
And we pray
Still we lay
Still we lay

Decisions in life you have to make
Which part of it you take its like dejavous
Stand by ur side stand next 2 u
B there in the middle when ur passing thru
In the middle meet u at the crossroads
Between love and hate between good and evil
We can see u right thru where u told
The truth or a single lie
Compared to the time when u made that man cry
Dont wanna talk abt the day ur gonna die
Soon or later that day will come
Where you have to make the right or wrong decision
Which part of it u take, make good or bad
Just separate things, u wanna do that shhh try and resist
At the end of the day its up 2 u
Il b there in the middle when ur passing thru!

(So you won't be lonely)

(See you at the crossroads
See you, see you
See you at the crossroads)

Who's that get off the train
Avirex jacket
With the poor with that rain
Why take that man's chain
No more trouble made

Livin' on the streets everyday
So lame
People walking past
Looking at you in shame
But they don't really care
Who's the one to blame
You're gonna take the wrong turn
You're gonna lose the game
You know its not you're fault
That life turned this way
But people don't care
Don't hear what you say
And the way it is now
Is the way it's gonna stay
There's no choice left but to hope and pray

(Breakdown)
(So you won't be lonely)

(See you at the crossroads
See you, see you
See you at the crossroads)
