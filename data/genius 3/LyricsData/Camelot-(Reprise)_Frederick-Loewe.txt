[ARTHUR]
Each evening, from December to December
Before you drift to sleep upon your cot
Think back on all the tales that you remember
Of Camelot

Ask every person if he's heard the story
And tell it strong and clear if he has not
That once there was a fleeting wisp of glory
Called Camelot

[COMPANY]
Camelot! Camelot!
I know it gives a person pause
But in Camelot, Camelot
Those were the legal laws

[ARTHUR]
Where once it never rained till after sundown
By 8 a.m the morning fog had flown
Don't let it be forgot that once there was a spot
For one brief shining moment

[COMPANY]
That was known as Camelot
