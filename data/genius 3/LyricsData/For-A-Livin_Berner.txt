[Intro/Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, yeah
I do this for a living, the cars and the spending
From start to the finish, I do it just to win it
I do this for the hood, I do this for the homies
I do this for the bitches, I do it so you know me
I do this for a living, the planes and the flights
I do this for the clear sky stars in the night
I do this for the dope boys still selling packs
I do this for the ones that ain't never coming back
I do this for a living

[Verse 1: Berner]
When I die, hope I'm forgiven
Cause in these streets we living
It's either death or prison
I never take a day off
We be gettin' weight off
Out of state hustle, I never had me a day job
When that plane take off, we be shippin' yay off
Never been a middle man, always been a straight boss
Cats be tellin' now-a-days
So I be watching who I hang with
Big Meech, Larry Hoover, I be on that same shit
In the drought, kick back, and watch the cane flip
Breaking bread with the same clique that I came with
The only thing on my mind, that make a killin'
I came up broke, nothing was given

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
I do this for a living, the cars and the spending

I do this for the clear sky stars in the night
I do this for the dope boys still selling packs
I do this for the ones that ain't never coming back
I do this for a living

[Verse 2: Killa Kyleon]
We're living it
Ain't no label gives me advances
All I got is my grind, taking penitentiary chances
While you're rapping right
I was in that hook wrapping white
Ain't 'bout no bother stoppin'
I'mma let Tano-no I ain't rappin'
And I'm gonna tell my kids that ain't no food in that icebox
But I got plenty green, purple lean, and a nine Glock
That they can't get no shoes when the new J's come out
And I'm gonna look at my bitch and say that the money run out
So I go and get that bread dough
Run out, make my salary
Right there on the block
But he lost some weight like it's some calories
Allergic to no money, so I'mma hustle to help my allergies
Get your money straight but we don't play
We can't be no pussies

[Hook: Big K.R.I.T.]
I do this for a living, the cars and the spending

I do this for the clear sky stars in the night
I do this for the dope boys still selling packs
I do this for the ones that ain't never coming back
I do this for a living

[Verse 3: Berner]
I hustle independent and if the raps don't sell
I'mma double off the pimpin'
Still moving P's out
Ship 'em to the deep South
This what the streets 'bout
You either ball or take that cheap route
In case I get cracked, gotta keep a hundred stash
It comes quick, but still we blowing money fast
I turn the dream into an everyday lifestyle
Tomorrow ain't promised, I gotta get it right now
Looking through my rear view, watching the clock
Blunt burning, got my bitch with me, watching for cops
On a mission tryna' get a million
I swear to God ain't no way I can describe the feelin'
Homie I do this for a livin'
