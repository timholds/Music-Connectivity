Breaking in a sweat
Like a Bomb-Threat
Is your silhouette
Fading out?

Nothing left to lose
Detonate the fuse
Another breaking news
Blowout

Ain't it beautiful?
So unusual
Life's a gas
And it's running out!

Living the cliche
Gonna seize the day
Bottle Rockets to celebrate
Celebrate!
Celebrate!

Carpe Diem A battle cry!
Are we all too young to die?
Ask for reason and no reply
Are we all too young to die?

Making a living
Making a killing
What's worth forgiving?
Alright!

A blink of an eye
Barely scraping by
Dominated by passerby!

Feeling out of luck
When the traffic's stuck
And you're feeling so left behind!

Getting of a binge
Get a second win
Another promise to make a change

Got a broken wing?
Hear the angels sing
When the signal is out of range
Ain't it strange?
Ain't it strange?

Carpe Diem A battle cry!
Are we all too young to die?
Ask for reason and no reply
Are we all too young to die?


Making a living
Making a killing
What's worth forgiving?
All right!

HEY!

Making a living OH!
Making a killing OH!
What's worth forgiving?
Alright!

RIGHT!

Carpe Diem A battle cry!
Are we all too young to die?
Ask for reason and no reply
Are we all too young to die?

Carpe Diem A battle cry!
Are we all too young to die?
Ask for reason and no reply
Are we all too young to die?
