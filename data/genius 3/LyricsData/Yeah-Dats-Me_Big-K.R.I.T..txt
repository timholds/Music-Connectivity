Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Yeah dats me, yeah dat, yeah dat, yeah dats me, yeah dats me
Who dat getting money? Ay, who dat getting money, shawty?

[Verse 1]
Ok, I wake up fresh, get up fly, drape myself, pimp my ride
Hit that slab, throw some gold, making shawty get down on the floor
I’ma have to show my ass, ride on glass, pump my brakes, [then I’m mad?]
Pop my trunk, then I flash, a nigga wanna try to act bad
We don’t wanna play no games
Fuck with lames, trick on hoes, that won’t change
Caught my lane, swang and swerve, I gotta watch out for the curb
We don’t really play that, play that, yea! Yeen bout that, bout that, no!
Then don’t come round, come round, here! Cause we’ll let them, let them, go!

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ok, I jump out fresh, shine all day, rep my hood, rep my state
Spot a little bad chick around my way, and holler out let's get paid
Always been about my grind, bout my bread
Don’t like haters and I don’t like feds
Don’t like shawties that tease all day like they won’t give a real nigga head
Peep this game just to get this dough
Throw it in the air when you hit this floor
Yea that’s me sitting on chrome feet
Maybe when you couldn’t see when I crept up slow
Watch yo head when I open my door, grab yo parachute then let’s go
Dark in the club with a pimp on glow, everybody saw me take yo ho like…

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Ay, balling, crawling, slamming doors! (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Be a pimp tight player like I’m supposed! (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Cuz my trunk on slam and my wrist on glow! (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Who dat getting money? Ay, who dat getting money, shawty?
I’m like show me where them dollars at (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Ski mask diva shopping bag (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
You ain’t spending then don’t holler back (yeah dats me, yeah dats me)
Who dat getting money? Ay, who dat getting money, shawty?
