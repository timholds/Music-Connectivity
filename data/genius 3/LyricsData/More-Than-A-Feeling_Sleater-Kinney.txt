More than a feeling
More than a feeling
When i hear that old song that you sang to me
I started dreaming
That i wouldn't feel any of this

(two, three, four)

Lying beside me in my bed
Once you died inside my head
Feeling more things than i ever could
Hating you worse than i ever showed
And i don't want to feel again

(two, three, four)

More than a feeling
When i hear those same words that you said to me
I started screaming
But you couldn't hear anything

(two, three, four)

Lying beside me in my bed
Once you died inside my head
Feeling more things than i ever could
Hating you worse than i ever showed
And i don't want to feel again

(two, three, four)

More than a feeling
When i sing that old song that i wrote for you
I started dreaming
That i wouldn't feel any of this again
Again
Again
Again
