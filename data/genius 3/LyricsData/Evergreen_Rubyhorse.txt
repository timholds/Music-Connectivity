Daddy's little racer in here brand new car
Top down for the weather and the sons of stars
Summer's soon, surrender
Eyes of blue, and time enough to shine

So come on, come one
You don't know it but you're coming right along

Baby's getting older under April skies
The road is getting warmer every day she drives
Old enough to know better
Time enough to know her left from right

So come on, come on
You don't know it but you're coming right along

Something's scrathing at the glass
All the angels drive too fast
Pull your dress off on the grass
See it falling
Summer's crawling over
Crawling over you

So come on, come on
You don't know it but you're coming right along
