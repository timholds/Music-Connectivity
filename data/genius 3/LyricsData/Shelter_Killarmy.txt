We gon do it like this, do it like this, word
Check it out yo, yo, yo

Chorus: (2x)
Through difficult times it's hard to maintain
Lookin for the shelter that blocks out the rain
Stress and pain could leave a mark on the brain
But one thing's for sure black God remains

[Beretta 9]
Through difficult times lots of unexpected
My pops disapproves cause I wanna make records
But check it, my home life for second, I feel neglected
I bounce the first chance I get, I stop to think a second
I wreck it, damn I'm gonna need a place to sleep
No major CREAM
I call up the God Supreme
I analyse, I'm plannin up a strategy
Fuck a fantasy I'm dealin with reality
Mentality that's wilder than the average cat
I snatch a CREAM and sell a nigga's candlewax
I hit the tracks, I hold cycle with my brothers
All is understood, peace lies amongst each other
But meanwhile, I maintain to keep the same
I smoke a bone every now and then to ease the pain
But through the struggle I know that only God remains

Chorus (2x)

[Shogun Assasson]
The streets is bugged
Seein young soldiers pedal drugs by the pound
The scheme is to catch CREAM at a fast rate
Start movin the product from state to state
Lay up and watch the profits inflate
Now you're a big time hustler, full time heavyweight contender
But you must remember
That your thoughts must be cold just like December
Stay low key so you won't catch a case
Throws comin in from the fiends who smoke base
Madman clientele, see your apartment start to swell
The last thing on your mind is a jail cell
You're blind, all you see is money
Lost in the illusion of luxury
It's a shame, you're in the game for the fame and the name
So spin the wheel of misfortune
I heard with the sling that escorts ya
Now your life is in jeopardy
Because you the brothers that's livin in the army

Chorus (2x)

Keep calm and don't expose and weak points
We'll all line up and fight together
I say, we must all stay together as a single unit
