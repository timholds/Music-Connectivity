[Verse 1]
When tomorrow comes, I'll be on my own
Feeling frightened of the things that I don't know
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes
When tomorrow comes
And though the road is long
I look up to the sky
And in the dark I found, I stop and I won’t fly
And I sing along, I sing along, then I sing along

[Chorus]
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see the sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
Can’t stop my heart when you shinin’ in my eyes
Can’t lie, it’s a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
Cause you're my flash light
You're my flash light, you're my flash light, oh

[Verse 2]
I see the shadows long beneath the mountain top
I'm not the afraid when the rain won't stop
Cause you light the way
You light the way, you light the way

[Chorus]
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see the sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
Can’t stop my heart when you shinin’ in my eyes
Can’t lie, it’s a sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
Light, light, light, you're my flashlight
Light, light, you're my flashlight, light, light, light, light, oh
You're my flashlight, oh-ohh
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see the sweet life (you and i)
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
Can’t stop my heart when you shinin’ in my eyes (shinin' in my eyes)
Can’t lie, it’s a sweet life (sweet life)
I'm stuck in the dark but you're my flashlight (you're my flashlight)
You're gettin’ me, gettin’ me through the night
Cause you're my flashlight
You're my flashlight, you're my flashlight
Oh-ohh oh-ohhh ohhhh ohh
You're my flashlight, light, light
You're my flashlight, light, light, yeah
(light, light, light, you're my flashlight, light, light)
You're my flashlight
