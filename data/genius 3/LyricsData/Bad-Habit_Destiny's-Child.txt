[Verse 1]
How many times are you gonna apologize about the same thing?
And how many times can I take you back
When I'm not the one that's doing wrong?
I thought maybe if I started praying that we would get better
But when I would pray the answer would always come back to me bein' done
But we are so hard headed when we're in love
So I

[Chorus]
I told myself that I would make some changes
But the more I change there's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me
And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
But I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

[Verse 2]
I'm totally out of my element
Learning new ways to live, while you're in a comfort zone
Not even thinking to call me
When I get mad you buy me gifts
Thinking it's gonna solve every issue
From the girl callin' my phone
To the pictures that I saw
And every time you would break up with me for nothing at all
I've taken all I could take
But the way I live has gotta change

[Chorus]
I told myself that I would make some changes
But the more I change there's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me
And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
But I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more

[Bridge]
Let me break it down
Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you was just to blind to see past
All of the pain they was causing you?
Ladies, do you feel me?
Have you ever loved somebody
So much that you went against the right things that you should do?
Then it's time to make a change
So I

[Chorus]
I told myself that I would make some changes
But the more I change there's one thing that remains the same
I can't seem to shake ya
You seem to really have a hold on me
And every time that we break up
We turn around and make up
This can't go on now
I gotta move on now
It's not the fact that I don't love you no more
But I gotta break this bad habit
Can't take this bad habit no more
