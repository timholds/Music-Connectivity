Big L:"My crew is in the house
Terra, Herb McGruff, Buddah Bless
Big Twan, Killa Cam, Trooper J, and Mike Boogie..."

[Verse 1: Mike Boogie]
Rest in peace to one of the greatest
My nigga Big L done made to the status of legend
All that from heaven,forever you my brethren
Reason we got shine,it is cause of you the niggas in China know I can rhyme
Brought my daughters to your wake,your moms in the front row
Lee too,escorted by the jakes
Line 'round the corner,Harlem showing love
Still fly - in your babe blue Coogi hat and gloves
That's what was,this is what it is
Son,they got you on joints with Pac And Big
And with Pun,fam,you was one of the best
Can't stress what you would have become
Your last album went gold
And thanks to the net nigga repped(?) all around the globe
Now they killed your brother Lee
And though ya'll together up in heaven
Still,you like a brother to me

Hook:
It's just me and Big L
Tt's just...just me and Big L

[Verse 2: Mike Boogie]
We went on tour in '93
The opening act for that Craig Mack nigga and B.I.G
Gave Puff a copy of that "MVP"
Then "One More Chance" was on his next CD,damn
Remember you and Mase was beefing
Mad that you ain't put him on that "8 iz enuff"
He felt you pipped(?) him
Then him and Cam got in it,but now this one is over
And Cam and them was beefing with Hova
You the one that put me on to Jay
You thought he's that nigga back then
You should see that nigga today
They put me in your documentary
And every word I said on that camera I got from memory
Be trying not to let it get to me - the fact that you're gone
Cause you was gonna put all of us on
But I ain't really trying to blow mine
RIP Lamont Coleman,yeah,thanks for the co-sign
