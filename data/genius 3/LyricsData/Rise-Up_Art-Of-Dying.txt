[Verse 1]
Cut my skin up 'cause you know that I bleed
Take what you want 'til you're done with me
I won't go that easily
I won't go without a fight

[Chorus]
Rise up
Take my life back
Rise up
'Cause I know where I wanna be
I'm done being victimized
Sick of being paralyzed
Rise up
Cut away the past
Take my life back
Rise up

[Verse 2]
[?], no mess
Did you get what you need
Try to wipe me out like a disease
I won't go that quietly
I won't go without a fight

[Chorus]

Take it back, take it back

[Partial Chorus]
Rise up
Take my life back
Rise up
'Cause I know where I wanna be

[Bridge]
Down comes the demons
Heal [?]
Facing the ashes
Kneeling in the pits

[Chorus 2]
Rise up
Rise up and take my life back
I'm done being victimized
Sick of being paralyzed
Rise up
Cut away the past
Take my life back
Rise up, take it back
