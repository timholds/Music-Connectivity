[Verse 1]
So can you man-
And yes, your friends can come
Thanks for askin' first (thank you)
Matter of fact, hold up, send some selfies first (thank you)
Oh yeah, shawty cute, just as cute as you (ghetto)
And yeah, I'm feelin' you, but let's get in a group (ghetto)
Both of y'all are fans, to what I understand (thank you)
Y'all look like y'all do drugs, do you want a Xan? (Take two)
And I could call my man so we could make it even (yeah)
But it's a special evening, plus, I'm greedy (yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2]
So can you manage a ménage, à ménager?
So can you manage?
Take off her bra while I take off the planet
'Cause I'm into that kind of thing, babe, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause two heads are better than one
Never the bad kinda thing, baby
'Cause two attempts is way more fun

[Chorus]
I'm into the group thang
I'm into the... yeah baby, I'm into the... yeah baby
I'm into the group thang, ayy
I'm into the... yeah baby, I'm into the... yeah baby

Yeah, yeah
'Cause I'm into, I'm into the...
