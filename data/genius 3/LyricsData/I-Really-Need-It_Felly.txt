Sauce boy came straight with that new shit

[Verse 1: Felly]
Aye Mastermind of this shit
I blow gas and slide in my whip
Got these labels after my bread
That's why shorty back in my crib
Don't need police trackin' where I live
Got my homies happy again
She be so attractive, so pretty
Ain't no holdin' back, I'm gon' get it

[Hook: Felly]
Come from CT, won't die young
Ride these drunk whiffs through the night, son (Skrt, skrt)
I got CCs, I'ma rise up (Yeah)
And let these dreams reach horizons
Stay on my mind
And I say oo ooh, oo ooh, I really need it
Wamme wamme say, oo ooh, oo ooh, I really need it
(You know what I'm sayin')

[Verse 2: Felly]
They gon' two step to the new shit, one time
I'm like "Who that? He ain't doin' shit," don't lie
I wake up and I keep movin', oh my
Keep my kids free from bullets
Stay on my grind
That ride way long for that Greystone
I been to on, I should lay low
Girl we can move on, if you say so
One time for these angels, they hang low (Straight up)

[Hook: Felly]
I got GPs and horizons, yeah
This that 3 g's one night, son
Down in South Central with the Fight Song (fight on)
She won't fuck me with the lights on
Losin' my mind
And I say oo ooh, oo ooh, I really need it (yeah)
Wamme wamme say, oo ooh, oo ooh, I really need it

[Zac Jones]
Gimme back baby, yo, gimme back baby

[Hook: Felly]
I got GPs and horizons (Straight up)
This that 3 g's one night, son (Wait up)
I keep movin' a lot, yeah
And I be feelin' alright

[GYYPS]
Yeah

[Felly]

[Interlude 1: Zac Jones]
Fling up on me girl, yo, yo
Fling up on me girl
Fling up on me girl, yo, yeah

[Felly]
La la la la la la
La la la la la la
La la, lu lu lu blu bluh (Aye)

[Verse 3: Felly]
Stay on some other shit
I'll keep to publishin'
Could give a fuck 'bout your company
I cook it up like my uncle did
Keep my team free from the government
Look at just what we did
See my footprints, I'm like fuck wit' me
Rappers, they stuck where my stomach be
They pull my legs like it's puppetry
Praise to the floor that be under me
Pants wit' the cuff
Shots to my head make me duck
Lately I could give a fuck
Lately I sleep on the bus
Lot of you dudes just need love
Think it's bad, you shoulda' seen the trunk
And I got the soul food in my gut
Sellin' out the pub, I ain't even 21
Like hold up, hol' up, I ain't come here to stunt
I'm just here to show love
Give my people head up, one love y'all

[Hook: Felly]
I got GPs and horizons
Oo ooh, I really need it
Wamme wamme say, oo ooh, wamme wamme say oo, ooh
I really need it

[Outro: Felly]
I been losin' my mind, losin my mind
I been losin' my mind, losin my mind
Ooh, I really need it
Y'all feel me, man?
Thanks man, see ya
