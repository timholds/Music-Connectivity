Right now leaving LAX
Please prepare for lift off
I'm on my way off
I haven't been away from Pasadena for a while
I'm riding in a plane you know
Its kind of cool
I'm tired as hell
(Snores)
Damn
Damn I'm on an island and shit
Oh
Oh this is beautiful
Oh look at the palm trees and shit
Oh
This is a great dream you know
Yeah I think I could dig this
Yeah
Funky island life you know
Yeah I think I could dig this
Yeah
Funky island life you know
Right right
Funky
I think I could just run through the fields all by myself
You know
Feeling kind of funky funky
Funky
Feeling kind of funky funky

I'm loving the island life

Feeling kind of funky funky
Funky
Feeling kind of funky funky

Excuse me sir
Excuse me
Would you like a drink

Oh shit
Wait a minute wait a minute
I was way out
I thought I was on an island just about two minutes ago
Skipping around in the fields and shit
Looking at the palm trees
And you know singing and shit
I understand
I guess its the real world you know
That's very true
Would you like a drink
