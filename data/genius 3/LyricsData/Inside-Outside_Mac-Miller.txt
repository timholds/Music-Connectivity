[Verse]
Yeah, yeah
Shoulda died already (faces)
I, shoulda died already, shit (faces)
Yeah, I shoulda died already (faces)
Came in, I was high already
Everybody tripping that my mind ain't steady
From my sin, shoulda been crucified already, rrah!
Why the fuck you need me? (faces)
Don't you know how to fly already?
Try to tell you that it ain't real (faces)
Tell 'em "Find that yeti" (owww!)
Oh, motherfucker! (I'm that yeti!)
And it all go down right now
I never been so ready
All my homies philosophers (damn right!)
Yeah, all my homies philosophers
Now I don't need nobody, I would love somebody though
Don't you ever get it fucked up
Everybody wanna be God
Beside God, he wanna be like us
We never sleep too much
Beat that pussy up, she gonna need that trust
Never see me on the street too much
But on the inside, I'm outside, all the time (faces, faces)
Tryna stay away from that electric shock
That electric shock, I'm outside

[Outro]
Faces, faces, faces, faces
Faces, faces, faces, faces
Faces, faces, faces, faces
