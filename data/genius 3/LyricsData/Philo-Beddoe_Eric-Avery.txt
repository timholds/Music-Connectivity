Why can’t I seem to recognize
I place I’ll always go to
It could be sunlight, it could be night
It’s only heat with your eyes closed

I’ll always try
I get tired though
Philo Beddoe

Now I make a funny kind of seed
But only stillness will grow here
I can’t do the digging out
Because I did the burying

I’ll always try
I get tired though
Philo Beddoe

In the middle of an office tower
You’ve taken hold of me
In the middle of a crowded house
You’ve taken hold of me
When I pause in a market aisle
You take a hold of me

Asking the heart to mobilize
Like a hand opening out
Shut you away in the drawer
Still you rattle the floor

I’ll always try
I get tired though
Philo Beddoe

In the middle of a summer shower
You’ve taken hold of me
In the mouth of a barking dog
You’ve taken hold of me
In the middle of a random, private moment
You take a hold of me
