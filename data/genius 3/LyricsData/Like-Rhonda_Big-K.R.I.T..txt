If you want I can get it
If you want I can get it
If you want I can get it
I'm talkin' everything baby, the money, the crib, the clothes, (?) she said
If you want I can get it
If you want I can get it
If you want I can get it
Just keep it real with a player, we make it, we rich, I'm talkin' just like (?) out that bitch

[Verse 1:]
Well if you willin' to go, I can take you wherever
They know I throw off the chain, like Tamme, who do it better?
On the grind for this cheddar, if you ride for a nigga
If I bust out the roof, well won't you drive for a nigga?
Live fly with a nigga? Takin' trips overseas
Break trick for his money and take that shit back to me
Pull a caper for nothin', if I needed your hustle
I can get it whenever, on the run from we fuckin'
I knew you when you was younger, now you grown and you ready
Showed you how to peep game, and now you get to the (?)
Independent and steady, rockin' diamonds and pearls
Yea, you know you my girl, I told you I want the world
You said

[Hook:]

[Verse 2:]
I know you ready for war, never trip on a ho
If they get outta line, you beat that ass to the floor
Don't be seein' them haters, just keep countin' this paper
Cook a meal for a playa, yea, you know how to cater
Get your hands, your nails done, your outfit fit tight
Them heels you love to rock make that ass sit so right
You know what a nigga like, freaky and classy
Tooted up and booted up, I love that you're nasty
I love that you're flashy and down for the cause
Never tell by any means if we breakin' the law
Never question my motives, I just want you to shine
I just want you beside me when we out on the grind
She Said
