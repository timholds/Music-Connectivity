[Chorus: Sean Slaughter and True-Asia]
This is more than rhymes, this is life and breath
Everyday all day we keeps it hot to death
If ya Holy Ghost filled then wave 'em right to left
In the name of Jesus Christ we bless

[Verse 1:True-Asia]
This be that brook-nam style to the 22nd psalm
The walk has been long but still remain strong
Trials and tribulation try to leave my brain scattered
I've been bruised and battered, abused by grammar
Still don't matter, hands clapped, tears down my cheek
Lord I feel weak but still it's you I seek
It's crazy, sometimes I get the strength of the navy
Other times I feel like curling up like a baby
I crack open the book the bread I take daily
Like God fed Elijah, Christ will never fail me
Exhale relief, the Holy Spirit never fails to leak
All glory, all hail the Chief
King Priest, pray and never let the spirit cease
There's drama all around me but still I feel at peace
At least I died to the flesh living it right
Living this life, because I'm Christ infinite wife

[Sean Slaughter]
We ain't the lost generation, people just can't find us
Instead of understanding they just readjust their blinders
Understand, we can't relate to ball players and movie stars
We just trying to eat pa, that ain't who we really are
That's why I say, the only way is the Christ way
I was on death road and He, showed me the life way
By living the right way, searching for a light ray
Deep inside a black hole now everyday's a bright day
But still, a stormy cloud trails me distantly
Trying to catch up, to rain on my parade and victory
And if I stumble, Christ is there to help me through the marathon
To me he is my paragon, I model him and carry on
Rise up son, it's your turn to carry the torch
To where Christ leads, besides that, ya hopes is lost
In the things that the world takes pleasure in, now ya rope is severing
Cause what you get out, is what you measured in
So what's ya sickness, cause Christ be that medicine
Let him heal the wounds that's been passed from ya next of kin
Black, White, Asian, island, Spanish, mixed, or Mexican
Ya slave days is over, trust in Christ and get ya rest again

[Chorus] 2X

[Verse 2: Sean Slaughter]
A chosen child of the king, it makes my spiritual sing
Adopted child of God, soon to inherit the crusted ring
And the diadem, prince of the crown
My Lord blankets the city just like surround sound, Satan biting styles now
By the name of Christ he's pound down, my dogs in heaven barking bow wow
Cause I'm a Christian, faith stronger than Sonny Liston
I tasted the world's tree of wisdom
Filled with fear, doubt and indecision, and switched positions
To follow the maker instead of blowing trees and chasing paper
Scheming on the next caper, now I'm in the Lord's vapor
Or should I say evervesence, God is ever-present
In my heart he got a residence, his suit is president
Ya feeling it, its everyday life that I be dealing with
Fruits of Christ I'm peeling it, real soldier cat's I'm kneeling with
Face down acknowledging the presence of the King's crown
Rain down, we ready like a bride in a clean gown

[Chorus] 4X
