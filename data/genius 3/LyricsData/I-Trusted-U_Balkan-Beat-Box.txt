[Chorus]
I trusted you
Now you're full of attitude
We used to be addicted to
Each other

I trusted you
Now you're full of attitude
We used to be addicted to
Each other

[Verse 1]
You never bothered to ask why
I left without saying goodbye
This time you didn't even try
And I'm not perfect I won't deny
But you got high on your own ego
My love is killing my libido
Now can you tell me where do we go?
I'm your man I'm no amigo

So where do we go from here?
That's how it is and it's not clear
There's no physical attraction
There's no way to get a fraction
Who got shot? Who got hit?
And who's the one to bear the guilt?
And who hang tight? Who got split?
And who the fuck needs that shit?

[Pre-Chorus]
Who got shot? Who's the one standing still?
Give me some time to forget and a reason to forgive
Who got shot? Who's the one standing still?
Maybe I'll come back might be able to believe
Who got shot? Who's the one standing still?

[Chorus]
I trusted you
Now you're full of attitude
We used to be addicted to
Each other

I trusted you
Now you're full of attitude
We used to be addicted to
Each other

[Verse 2]
We're all players in a game
And it's all the same
Now you look me in the eyes
And try to fantasize
But you always look away
You've got nothing to say
What do you want to do?
About me and you?

You can smile or laugh
But it's less than half
Of what makes a whole
So make the call

You keep spitting in my face
I'm a rat in your race
And your hand is full of lies
But you're my love in disguise

[Final Chorus]
Who got shot? Who's the one standing still?
Give me some time to forget and a reason to forgive
Who got shot? Who's the one standing still?
Maybe I'll come back might be able to believe
Who got shot? Who's the one standing still?
Maybe I'll come back might be able to believe
