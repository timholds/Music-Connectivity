If you are available
If you are available

[Verse:]
This is what we're lookin' for
S***, independent, never scared to let it go
Always positive, willing to communicate
Baby, this is what we're lookin' for

[Verse 2:]
She's gotta s** appeal, keep it real
Kinky as we wanna be
And she gotta give in, always giving
Gotta be very spiritual and emotional
Baby if you really wanna know

So if you are available
(Q, Mike, Slim, Daron)

Repeat [Verse:]

Repeat [Verse:]

Repeat [Verse 2:]
If you really wanna know
(Q, Mike, Slim, Daron)

Repeat [Verse:]
If you are available
(Q, Mike, Slim, Daron)
Oh if you are available
