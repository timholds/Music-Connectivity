[Hook]
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become


[Verse 1]
When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch

[Hook]
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
They all feel the same

[Verse 2]
I should've let you leave
But I let you watch me slip away
I could've set you free
But I'm selfish
I watched you stay, oh

[Bridge]
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away

[Hook]
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame

It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone

And die with a smile

They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Cause no one will love you, like her

Like tears in the rain

Don't show the world how alone you've become

[Bridge]

So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
