Don't you know you better get some sleep
You better get some sleep now
But all you're gonna do is run out there
And hide in the sound
Looking good from a distance
While you're dancing around

No slowing down no one with questions around
A soul left behind is more than a matter of time
Sing you will rise and shine

Everybody's gonna get somewhere
Gonna get somewhere now
Everybody's going faster
And faster somehow
Looking good from a distance
While you're dancing around

Cars and pearls in line
You can see how they shine
The thrill of a crime
But hear them desperately crying
We will rise and shine
Looking good from a distance
While you're dancing around
Me running down the platform
You're waving your hand
Don't know where you lost it
I don't understand

Looking good from a distance
And all the way from the shore
The oceans will roar and drag you in
Good-looking from a distance
While you're dancing around
I'm running down the platform waving my hand
