Take your time listen to him
A shy message he carries within
But he holds the truth
Tho soft spoken he be
Dr. Ben Carson makes sense
He sees

Give him the fire to gain
The gravitas it takes to win
He has a message that is true
He's himself, black and light
Like you

Sometimes right just needs a push
Baby steps after the burned bush
Open the heart and the mind
Discern the mean from the kind

He is awesome, but in the next year he needs FIRE in his voice...support him
