No childlike innocence
I turned away
When the world I loved became the enemy
They talk about you
They shout out loud
When they get bored of talking about themselves
When I've lost the lust for life
I know I'll find a way
I'll find it where
I left it all that time ago
And if you feel like letting go
I know you'll find a way
You'll find it where
You left it all that time ago
The pressure of your eyes
Has turned me cold
I fear myself
The paranoia, will drive us mad
The paranoia, will drive us mad
The paranoia, will drive us mad
They talk and then they laugh but you assure yourself
That they meant well, they meant well
They talk about you
They shout out loud
When they get bored talking about themselves
Letting go
I know I'll find a way
I'll find it where
I left it all that time ago
The paranoia, will drive us mad
The paranoia, will drive us mad
I'll find a way, I'll find a way
I'll find a way, I'll find it where I left it all that time ago
