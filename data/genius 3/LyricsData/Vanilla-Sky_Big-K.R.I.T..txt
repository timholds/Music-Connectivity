[Intro]
Leave the town, smoke some herb
Speak the word, drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through

[Hook]
We can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

[Verse 1]
Is it sad that I'd rather hustle
Get this money on the double
You don't get it
It's cryptic for the simple minded
The type don't see the future even if they right behind it
So I'm chilly willy when talking bout dreams to most folk
Cause to me it seems like a billion when you came up dirt poor
And that's like talking about the summer to someone that only seen snow
It ain't rocket science, either it's a dud or it blow
Damn, I wanna make some hard decisions
Like should I really get a driver when I cop a Bentley?
Is that thousand dollar suit worth it cause it's vintage?
If I bring two woman with me, does that mean I'm pimping? Maybe
Did the cuff links give it away
Or the mink on display, no hesitation to pay
Make reservations to play while most work
I'm in pursuit of happiness, I'm tired of hurt

[Hook]
So we can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

[Verse 2]
I just wanna go to Africa
Find the meaning of life and try to master the art of meditation
The purest concentration
Cause all this weed and drank I pour might cause me complication
But for now we spilling drops all on the kitchen counter
Breaking down God green earth, fight for what we had first
They knocked the nose off the sphinx so we can't tell
Coulda' been kings and queens, but now we pumping cells
So, fuck outta' here with your undercover ways
Snaking in the grass, looking to get paid
Fade to black
When I'm tryna' get my piece of mind
Let my girl massage my temple to unlock my shine
Just a matter of time, she say that I will become the man that I'm supposed to be
I put my faith in the hands of God even though times is hard
I'm happy just to be

[Hook]
So we can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

[Bridge]
Ain't gotta twist it like a [?]
All we need to know is where the bread at
Thinking bout some moves to make
Right some wrongs, bills to pay
Flashing lights, pass the dice
Let me roll Reverend, hope I hit seven
Baby need a new pair of shoes
If I don't give it, tell me what we gon do?

[Hook]
We can roll around, leave the town
Smoke some herb, speak the word
Drank a brew
Even with the highs, the best of times
Golden buys, you can't hide what you're going through
Underneath vanilla skies

[Outro]
*Gun shot*
Oh shit
Who you in here fucking? (nobody, cachorros, cachorros)
Come here motherfucker
Sit yo' motherfucking ass down (Fuck you nigga)
Come here motherfucker (Hell)
Don't run (Whoo)
