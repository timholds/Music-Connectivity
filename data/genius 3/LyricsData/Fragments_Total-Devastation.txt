Multiply your pain three times
Head shakes pressure grows
Victimized with vulgar lies
Throwing up now six times

Pale face anger grows
Had enough with your life
Feel the need to tell someone
In my hour of blackness

Black, fuck, god, dead
Make them go away
Puss, suck, god, dead
Rip them off me

Won't someone

Stabbed someone four times
Red blood cold death
Roaring breaks in my mind
Throwing up now nine times

Gather my mind fragments
Get them together
