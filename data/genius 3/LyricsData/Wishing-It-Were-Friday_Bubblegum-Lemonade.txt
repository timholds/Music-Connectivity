[verse 1]
On Monday, it's Game of Thrones
On Tuesday, I'm Home Alone
On Wednesday, To The Manor Born
On Thursday, I'm wishing it were Friday
Friday, I'm wishing my life away

[verse 2]
Monday's not on my mind
Tuesday, there's too much time
On Wednesday, I tow the line
Till Thursday, I'm wishing it were Friday
Friday, I'm wishing my life away

SOLO

[verse 3]
On Monday, I missed the train
Tuesday, I'm late again
On Wednesday, no one else to blame
On Thursday, I'm wishing it were Friday
Friday, I'm wishing my life away

[verse 4]
On Monday, it's Summer rain
On Tuesday, Sun's back again
On Wednesday, I can't complain
Till Thursday, I'm wishing it were Friday
Friday, I'm wishing my life away

[verse 5]
On Monday, should've stayed in bed
On Tuesday, I'm the Walking Dead
On Wednesday, watch TV instead
Till Thursday, I'm wishing it were Friday
Friday, I'm wishing my life away

[verse 6]
Monday, starts off the week
On Tuesday, I hit repeat
On Wednesday, I think I'll sleep
Till Thursday, I'm wishing it were Friday
Friday, I'm wishing my life
On Friday, I'm wishing my life
On Friday, I'm wishing my life away
