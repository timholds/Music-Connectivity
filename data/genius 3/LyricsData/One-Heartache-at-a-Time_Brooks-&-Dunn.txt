[Verse 1]
Just sitting here minding my own broken heart
Still hurting like the night she went away
Here you come a double shot of trouble in your eyes
Now Heaven knows there'll be hell to pay

[Chorus]
I can't take but just one heartache at a time
I've gotta wait 'til I've had a chance
To drink her off my mind
Well I'll save some tears and meet you here
Somewhere down the line
I can't take but just one heartache at a time

[Verse 2]
I'd be lying lying in your loving arms
And tempted as I am I can't pretend
Just my luck
You picked tonight to set your sights on me
Darling can't you see the shape I'm in

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
Oh I can't take but just one heartache at a time
