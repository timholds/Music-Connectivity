[verse 1: Little Simz]
Oh what you know about space age
What you know about reems, chuck20 n the josh arce
Never blaspheme in the eyes of god
We the young gods you know you won’t be saved
Never been another escape
Damn right so the music got my soul engraved
They can never drive me insane
I leave everybody in agony
If love is pain
I been up too late
Tyrin to figure out a iller strategy of how I’m gonna switch up the game
Who I became
Is a better version of my anatomy some people tellin me give up the name
Never no way
This that shit you zone to this that shit you blow to
Up up away
This that shit you know fool this that shit that’s cold
You can bring anybody my scene’s involved
If there’s an issue then we can get that solved
Nothing but chill bitches over here
Like jade and jasmine if sienna’s in vogue
This that late night rantin
Everybody feelin inspired in the studio
Space age we the baddest oh
I’m sayin it like you don’t know
Better know my clique

[hook: Little Simz]
Been to outer space and back
3000x
Oh, Better wheel it, pull the track

On my team 3000

Yeah we takin off and we shoutin
All my team 3000

All my team 3000

[verse 2: Josh Arcé]
What you know about space age
If it ain’t nothing good then you probably never heard of space age
I tell em with a straight face
I’m the main face when I say space on a song it’s like a drug to a date rape
You need a mate, mate
If you ever wanna step up, add pressure to the same game
That u lames play
Cuz you play lame
On another level I’m the clouds you the ground when I make rain
Make it fall on you fools
I don’t fuck with no ghouls
Cuz that white sheet on your head talk will get you buried alive when I [?]
Yeah i spit that shit that make you drool
I make places and faces better
Sometimes I like to sit down
And just [?] by the fact that I can’t get better
Let’s get it
I’m a king to a peasant and a crown to a king
I’m not crowning the prince, cuz the crown is the king’s
Make your crown disappear, if you’re clowning with death
If the clown wants the crown, then it’s off with your head

I kill em twice cuz I’m meant to do it
My execution is execution
Guillotine lay your head to rest
Space cut you out
That’s how you do it

[verse 3: Chuck20]
What you know about space age
Pull up in a lab in all black
& write rhymes, blowin out smoke and climax
The max point five that you weren’t involved at
That my flows are hot chillin with corona
I won’t ask you to prepare it’s too late
I swear we too great
The rare the four steaks [?]

3000x you say (space)

Face it
3000 times I’ve been spacin
3000 trips all to space and earth
And I did it all in my spaceship
Show me thousands all on my payslip
I thank niggas who done paved the way
I show respect where respect is due
I'd hope you respect the space
Anybody in the atmosphere
I ain’t never been showin fear so get it clear
Real black hippie, that’s tun up
Space that’s solar
I don’t need no cheers
Cuz all of these niggas are gonna disappear
Tell them I’m gone
Chillin up in space boy
That’s where I belong
