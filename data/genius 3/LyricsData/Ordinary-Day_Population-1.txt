Bad dream
Wake me when it's over
It can't be
My eyes refuse to focus

This pain i feel for you
These tears i shed for you
This prayer i sing for you

God today is not an ordinary day
Wind it back and make it go away
We'll pay for all our sins but not today
Not this way

Can't reach
Your stuck inside my tv
I'll break glass
I'll reach and pull you out

This pain i feel for you
These tears i shed for you
This prayer i sing for you
