A ray of hope
Flickers in the sky
A tiny star lights up
Way up high
All across the land
Dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass
When a child is born
A silent wish
Sails the seven seas
The winds of change
Whisper in the trees
And the walls of doubt
Tumble tossed and torn
This comes to pass
When a child is born
A rosy hue
Settles all around
You start to feel
You're on solid ground
For a spell or two
No one seems forlorn
This comes to pass
When a child is born
It's all a dream
An illusion now
It must come true
Sometime soon somehow
All across the land
Dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass
When a child is born
A ray of hope
Flickers in the sky
A tiny star lights up
Way up high
All across the land
Dawns a brand new morn
This comes to pass
When a child is born
