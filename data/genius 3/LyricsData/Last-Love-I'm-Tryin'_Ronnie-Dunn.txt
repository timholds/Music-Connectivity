[Verse 1]
I'm in this, for good forever baby
No more sorta kinda maybes
This time, no losin' balance
Come what may, no matter what happens
No more goin' from this one to that one
All the way, that's all that matters

[Chorus]
I don't think, I can take another
Here today, gone tomorrow lover
Dancin' in and out of my life
Not sure, I could survive
Oh, I'm no quitter, I can't take
Handin' over my heart, havin' somebody break it
This is as high, as I'm flyin'
This is, the last love I'm tryin'

[Verse 2]
Sad and lonely, I can't allow to hurt me
No givin' into love, havin' it desert me
This time, all the way together
I can't tell you, how important this is
Been through to way too many, hits and misses
Almosts, nearly forevers

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't think, I can take another
Here today, gone tomorrow lover
Dancin' in and out of my life
Not sure, I could survive
Oh, I'm no quitter, I can't take
Handin' over my heart, havin' somebody break it
This is as high, as I'm flyin'
This is, the last love I'm tryin'

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't think, I can take another
Here today, gone tomorrow lover
Dancin' in and out of my life
Not sure, I could survive
Oh, I'm no quitter, but I can't take
Handin' over my heart, havin' somebody break it
This is as high, as I'm flyin'
This is, the last love I'm tryin'

[Outro]
I don't think, I can take another
Here today, gone tomorrow lover
This is, the last love I'm tryin'
