[Verse 1]
I walk these streets, a spotlight covers me
It's getting quiet, I see no money
I've seen a lifetime in this town
Found love and lost my mind

[Chorus]
You have seen all my changing faces
You have never put me down
I want to thank you
Just want to thank you

[Verse 2]
And down the path, they're drinking from the can
Time to forget the hood that covers mine
I've seen them fighting in your yard
Pavements cracked, inject me in your arms

[Chorus]
You have seen all my changing faces
And you have never put me down
I want to thank you
Just want to thank you

[Bridge]
When I leave you I try
To block it out my mind
Lose myself in a world away
From who I am, ah, ah

[Chorus]
You have seen all my changing faces
And you have never put me down
I want to thank you
Just want to thank you
