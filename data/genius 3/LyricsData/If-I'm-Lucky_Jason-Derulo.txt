[Verse 1]
Who are you to say, that I didn't love you?
'Cause I didn't love the way you wanted
And who am I to blame?
When I didn't trust you enough to let you in the way I wanted
Stop, okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Vodka on my lips
Took too many drinks
Makes me reminisce all the way down
To my happy place, you're my happy place
I can't handle us now

[Chorus]
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya, flipside of the graveyard
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday
If I'm lucky, I'll meet ya, heaven or high water
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but maybe
If I'm lucky, eh
If I'm lucky, eh
I'll get your lovin' (yeah)
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday

[Verse 2]
Who am I to say, that it wasn't good, babe?
Just thinkin' 'bout our loving gives me chills up and down my spine
I dare you not to miss me
'Cause what we had was more than just a (thrill)
Stop, okay

[Pre-Chorus]
Vodka on my lips
Took too many drinks
Makes me reminisce all the way down
To my happy place, you're my happy place
I can't handle us now

[Chorus]
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya, flipside of the graveyard
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday
If I'm lucky, I'll meet ya, heaven or high water
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but maybe
If I'm lucky (eh)
If I'm lucky (if I'm lucky, eh)
I'll get your lovin' (yeah)
Miss when you say (yeah)
I really miss it babe
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday

[Post-Chorus]
I'm selfish for you (ooh)
I'm selfish for you (ooh)

[Chorus]
If I'm lucky I'll meet ya, on the flipside of the graveyard
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday
If I'm lucky, I'll meet ya, heaven or high water
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but maybe
If I'm lucky (if I'm lucky, baby) (eh)
If I'm lucky (if I'm lucky, baby) (eh)
I'll get your lovin'
'Cause things didn't work out in this life, but someday

[Post-Chorus]
I'm selfish for you (ooh)
I'm selfish for you (ooh)
And only you, baby
