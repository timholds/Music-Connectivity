[Verse 1]
She said goodbye to her daddy while her mamma cried
I kept the motor running in my car outside
She kissed him on the cheek, daddy's little girl
Then a woman walked out to take on the world
Through red taillights and a cloud of dust
We went flying through the night, it was all about us
Sitting on the seat right next to me, we drove with a tank full of destiny

[Chorus]
She was born to run
She was born to run
She was born to run born to run to me

[Verse 2]
With a new world waiting down the road up ahead
Passion running wild through our hearts and heads
With everything we owned packed in the backseat
We had each other, that was all we needed
They all called me crazy, said she'd never settle down
I was just her ticket, her ticket out of town
But it looks like that night fate proved 'em wrong
Because she's been mine, mine all along

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's been years now and I never doubted
Somewhere, somehow we'd make through
She's still here, no two ways about it
Her heart's still mine and her love's still true

[Bridge]
She was born to run
Was the Master's plan
Born to run
Put her heart in my hand
Born to run born to run to me

[Chorus]
