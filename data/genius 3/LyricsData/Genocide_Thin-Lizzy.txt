When they try to tell you knowledge is a dangerous thing
It's such a dangerous thing
The people that have it are the people that sin
And the people that need it are the people that can never win
They can never win
Let me get you out of here little broken wing
There are people 'round here that are right
There are people 'round here that like to sleep at night
There are people 'round here that go slow
There are people 'round here
That don't take kindly to the killing of the buffalo, oh no
When they tear up all the treaties and break up all the plans
They break up all the plans
Did you do your duty and kill on command?
Did you know the red man used to roam this land?
He used to roam this land
Now the souls of lost warriors blow across the sands
People 'round here, they get it right
People 'round here, we like to sleep at night
There are people 'round here that go slow
People 'round here
That don't take kindly to the killing of the buffalo, oh no
So listen to my story and listen to it well
You better listen well
Listen to the glory of the gory details of the tale I tell
Did you know the red man very well?
I used to know him well
Did you know the hunting ground before it became a hell?
There are people 'round here that are right
There are people 'round here that like to sleep at night
There are people 'round here I don't know
There are people 'round here
That don't take kindly to the killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo, the killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo, the killing of the buffalo
The killing, the killing of the, the killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo, the killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo, the killing of the buffalo
The killing, the killing
So listen to my story of genocide
How they were hunted and slaughtered
Till there was no place left to hide
Did you know the red man used to hold his head with pride?
Till every man, woman and child were destroyed
There are people 'round here that get it right
There are people 'round here that couldn't sleep at night
There are people 'round here I don't know
There are people 'round here
That don't take kindly to the killing of the buffalo
There are people 'round here that understand
There are people 'round here that couldn't give a damn
There are people 'round here that go slow
There are people 'round here
That don't take kindly to the killing of the buffalo
There are people 'round here
That don't take too kindly to the killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo, the killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo, the killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo, the killing, the killing of the
They're killing all the buffalo, the killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo, the killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo, the killing, they're killing all the
They're killing all the buffalo, the killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo, the killing of the buffalo
The killing of the buffalo, the killing, the killing
The killing of the buffalo
