I didn't say 'I love you'
When I had the chance
And now I lie here bleeding
I'm in an awful mess

I know it's not the right time
To become a religious man
But I've got that nasty feeling
It's my only chance

There is no pain, no sign of life
I took in vain my only life
I can't explain where the time went
Now I'm breathing my final breath

I fell awake while sleeping
Forgot to remember how
I gave my best at taking
Had everything but more

The pavement's getting cold now
You're the best thing in my life
I really should have told you
But I didn't have the time

There is no pain, no sign of life
I took in vain my only life
I can't explain where the time went
Now I'm breathing my final breath

There is no pain, no sign of life
I took in vain my only life
I can't explain where the time went
Now I'm breathing my final breath

Now I'm breathing, my final...
There goes... my last breath
There goes... my last breath
There goes... my last breath
There goes... my last breath
There goes... my last breath
There goes...
