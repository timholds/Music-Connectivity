[Verse 1]
The black and green scarecrow as everyone knows
Stood with a bird on his hat and straw everywhere
He didn’t care

[Hook]
He stood in a field where barley grows

[Verse 2]
His head did no thinking
His arms didn’t move except when the wind cut up
Rough and mice ran around on the ground

[Hook]
He stood in a field where barley grows

[Verse 3]
The black and green scarecrow is sadder than me
But now he’s resigned to his fate
‘Cause life’s not unkind – he doesn’t mind

[Hook]
He stood in a field where barley grows
