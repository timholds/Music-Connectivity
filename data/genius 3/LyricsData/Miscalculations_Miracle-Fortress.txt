Real me in
I'm about to give it a rest
I was always steps behind
Drop another lines out through and they'll hang me out to dry

I'm trying to picture your house
I want to be there every night
Feeling kind of depressed
But the trade is days behind, anyway

They put you in the New York Times
But your room-mates tore it up
It's no reflection on you or other people
They just despise and hate your guts

You got everything and more
You got everything and more
You been everywhere and more
You got everything and more
I do without
Nothing but I dream about it
How long have I been dreaming about you?
I'll never know
I think I'll dream about nothing any more

Calculations at mid-may
Step into no-man's land
There's been some miscalculations
There's no room left to stand

Calculations at mid-may
Step into no-man's land
There's been some miscalculation
There's no where here for you to stand

Flipped up the tail lights wagging, flagged me from (??)
Read my own Miranda Rights and my face (??) in the dirt
One very last night of your life just shut it down just hit delete
Crowd sourced from the great beyond 'cause there's no chance you'll compete

You got everything and more
You got everything and more
I'll do without
Without, without, without

Calculations at mid-may
Step into no-man's land
So many thousands of people
There's nowhere left to stand

Calculations at mid-may
Step into no-man's land
There's been some miscalculations
There's no where left for you to stand

Calculations at mid-may
Step into no-man's land
There's been some miscalculation
There's no where left here for you to stand
