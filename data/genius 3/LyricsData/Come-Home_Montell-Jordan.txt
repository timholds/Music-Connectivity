Verse 1

Baby
I've been thinking about our love
And thought
Maybe...
We could spend a little time, because
Lately
The moments that we share have been so
Shaky
You're still here, but you're not here

Chorus

Girl, you're been away too long
Won't you come home
Come home
I been missing you
Since you been gone
Won't you come home
Come home

Verse 2

You said...
That you need a change of pace, and so
I said...
We both could use a little space
Never thinking...
A little while would be forever without your love
Without your love

Bridge

I can't imagine life
I can't imagine loev
If you're not here with me
'Cause I can't get enough
So when you change your mind
My arms are open wide
Do what you gotta do
Just know I'm missing you

Repeat Chorus 2X
