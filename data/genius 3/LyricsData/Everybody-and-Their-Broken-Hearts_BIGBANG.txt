Everyone I ever loved or even care about has some kind of troubled background
You see it in their eyes looking at each other in a secondhand store
Think you found the one we can make this work I guess
We can make a run so much hope
All you gotta do or all I gotta do is spend time on it

I'm on the rack again
Almost healed ironed and smooth
Please take me where I belong

And I will tell you
Baby you're the prettiest one
Why can't you come along?

Well it's all right it's all right
I mean hey look who you're talking to
You really want my opinion
Messing up in love everyone should do
And then we get better at it

Everybody and their broken hearts
All reaching out to you

The sun is peeking thru leaves and branches of nearby trees
Silhouettes play on naked white walls here on Branden Street
Had it not been for the reminder of the distant droning freeways

You would be surprised
If someone tried to tell you girl
La is no paradise

But I'm coming back again
Almost healed ironed and smooth
Because this is where I belong

And I will tell you
Baby you're the prettiest one
Just wish you'd come along

Well it's all right it's all right
I mean hey look who you're talking to
I'll never stop dreaming
Messing up in love everyone should do
And then we get better at it
Everybody and their broken hearts
All reaching out to you
Feed off the sparks from your Al Pacino eyes
Till they burn right thru

Well it's all right it's all right
I mean hey look who you're talking to
I'll never stop dreaming
Messing up in love everyone should do
We might just get better at it
See everybody and their broken hearts
And us wannabe Heartbreakers too
Feed off the sparks from your Al Pacino eyes
Until they burn right thru
