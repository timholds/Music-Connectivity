[Verse 1]
Well I'll bet by the time I get to Tulsa
She'll be pulling on them tight blue jeans
She'll go down to Cowboy's, buy herself a cold one
And on a Friday night in Dallas, she's a cowboy's dream
Something tells me she'll sit out the first one
Then they'll play George Strait and she'll be gone
Cause heaven knows that girl was born to two-step
And Texas women don't stay lonely long

[Chorus]
It's a fact that women like the one I left
Can find somebody else, any time they want
It's a shame, but I'm afraid the one I love
She don't like waiting much
Texas women don't stay lonely long

[Verse 2]
I'd sure like to think she'd wait forever
Welcome me back in with open arms
But she don't walk the floor, she don't count the teardrops
And she don't pick up pieces from no broken heart
I wish I could call and say I'm sorry
But there's nobody sitting by the phone
You know she meant it when she told me that she loved me
But Texas women don't stay lonely long

[Chorus][x2]
