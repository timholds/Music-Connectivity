[Big K.R.I.T: Hook]
In my time machine, yeah I ride, clean
Marinate the scene with my high beams
Candy coated dreams, whenever I, lean
Take me far and far, this ain’t just a car
This my time machine (take me way back)
This my time machine (take me way back)
This my time machine (take me way back)
Take me far and far, this ain’t just a car
This my time machine

[Killa Kyleon: Verse 1]
Killa back to the future, Marty McFly I ain't letting my roof up
Top down, inside's [?], might knock a block down if I pull my coupe up
Ice cream paint job, ice scooper
Sittin' on supers, jammin' that Luther
Vandross, better have her pants off
Kush got a nigga stoned like I looked at Medusa
Fresh out ice
My inside's white
Just like cocaine
My doors is red
Don't fuck no ducks
My bitch 10 plus, if she shotgun
My hoes is red
I'm folding bread, no P.B.J
Smoke 3.5 no GPA
I T.C.B [?]
So I see pay
So yo ho on D.I.C.K
Getting paid, my fetish lettuce, relish
I like my veggies, steamed. That green
Killa ain't no cook, but when I burn my shit
I don't like no reggie
Hey!
Two doors, blue doors, new folds
Got the Cadillac lookin' so Tonka
Candy paint so wet on that bitch, like it came out a wrapper
Got sprayed by Wonka
Crawling dine
My 5th holding trunk high
Isn't that ironic?
I am too when you see me sliding by
1984, [?] sittin' on the 84's
Lookin' like it's 1984 when I be..
Yeah!
