Chorus A (@sean_braxton):
Candlelight vigils outside of our businesses
Marks another child not present for they Christmases
Hearing all the silence and omissions of the innocent
Drowned out by the cries ofs of how flawed the system is
How many more children have to die
While we stand idly by
Watching parents cry
Too afraid to protect our streets
Tell me who else is going to weep for…

Chorus B (Shayrielle/Keisha):
Baby Malijah
Baby Malijah...
Tell me who else is going to weep for… Baby Malijah

Baby Malijah...
Wipe away your tears/Wipe your tears away
Baby Malijah...

Verse 1 (@ashesthechosen):
Peace signs for Baby Malijha
These words from my heart as honorable as Elijah
Mind ya...
...I’m rhymin’ trying to find it that next level
They was dancin’ with the stars
I was dancin’ with the devil
Trying to save em with these bars from the bars that await em
Whether Amen, Shabbat Shalom, or Wa-Alaikum-Salaam
...Last night she came to me in my dreams
Asking why she had to die and what her murder really means
She said “I miss my mommy and my daddy. Miss my granny miss my toys
But where I am, things are happy
There's so many others like me
Up here I'm never alone
But one thing up here is common
That we all miss home
Then she ask why some hurt to find they purpose
That notion left me wordless
Her question left me speechless
I can’t figure out that quotient
Think about how many times…
How many innocent babies den died
And how do we rationalize?
And how many times we are praying for mothers that cry
Innocence lost to nonsense
Ding in streets where killin’ is constant
Where colors get took out of context
And guns get emptied of contents
No eye-witnesses in instances where they say it takes a village
Kids grow with them images fall to viciousness
...Sometimes it feels so limited
The pain’s so vivid and hurts worser when you mention it
Precursor like I came before
I’m burdened with this penmanship
My cursive fightin’ curses for the black and brown membership
Our nemesis is both officer eat a dick
And papas that leave us quick
And all the street corners offering leadership
...However misguided
No boy scouts where we live
So what we see is one sided
See all these corny rappers popping pills
Get kids to try it
Make the rain with our dollars
Hear our hollers and go quiet
(Pause)
But I'm gone keep being me
And addressing what I see
Til all my people are free
