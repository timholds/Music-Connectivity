This might not make sense if I don't explain it
What's it gonna take for me to find out
Everything I need to know for right now?

It gets hard to fight with such weary eyes
I'll do all takes for me to find out
I think I found a way, I can show you how

If my heart won't open up I will never see the sun

All it takes is
A little bit of time
To make you realize
That love is
Hard to find when
You re-open your eyes
So open up your mind
And you'll find
It takes time (yeah, it takes time)
To realize (time to realize)

You can look ahead but you can't look down
Everything you need is with you right now

What if this is not exactly what I want?
I've been doing all it takes to find out
But I can't find a way to figure out how

What if this is just exactly what I want?
All it takes just to face this now is
A little bit of time just to slow this down

If your heart won't open up you will never see the sun

All it takes is
A little bit of time
To make you realize
That love is
Hard to find when
You re-open your eyes
So open up your mind
And you'll find
It takes time (yeah, it takes time)
To realize (time to realize)

You can look ahead but you can't look down
Everything you need is with you right now

And the rain came down onto the train tracks
I lost of the road, we drove under the overpass
And in that moment suddenly it made sense
Even the rain had taken a breathe
I was closed off
I was breaking
I've been pushing away
All my safe bets
There were voices fighting inside of me
Two sides of the story
Make it hard to find clarity

All it takes is
A little bit of time
To make you realize
That love is
Hard to find when
You re-open your eyes
So open up your mind
And you'll find
It takes time (yeah, it takes time)
To realize (time to realize)

You can look ahead but you can't look down
Everything you need is with you right now
