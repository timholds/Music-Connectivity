I have had the same old dream always lately
And i do not want to dream no more
I have had the same recurring dreams lately
And what i have dreamt i am not quite sure
I am not quite sure

Recurring dreams

All that we see
All that we see or seem
Is just a dream
Just a dream within a dream

I have had the same old dream always lately
Day in day out day after day
I had the same old dream again today
And i do not want to dream again
Dream again
