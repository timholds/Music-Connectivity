It's a white dot coming at you fast
It's a little spot snaking through the grass
Take your best shot
Show a little class
It'll come to ya
Keep your head in the game
Take the bat
Put it in your hands
Pull down your hat
Look right at the man
Be cool cat
Stick to the plan
Don't listen to the noise
Of the fans in the stands
Keep swinging it
Keep swinging it
Keep swinging it
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it

Now keep in mind
That anything can happen
Take your time
Not this or maybe that one
Tow the line
Stick with it friend
Sure enough
Got to be present to win
Keep swinging it

Keep swinging it
Keep swinging it
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it

It's a white dot coming at you fast
It's a little spot snaking through the grass
Take your best shot
Show a little class
It'll come to ya
Keep your head in the game
Keep swinging it
Keep swinging it
Keep swinging it
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it
Keep swinging
Keep swinging
Keep swinging
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it
You can do it
