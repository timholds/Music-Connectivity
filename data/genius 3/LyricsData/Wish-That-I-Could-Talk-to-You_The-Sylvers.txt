Into my life
There comes a change
That makes me feel like crying
I played on your love
And when you left, girl
I just felt like dying

I, I, I, I wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
(So that I can let you know, I)
I wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
(So that I can let you know)
Where I stand

I'm sorry I said
(I said)
That I wouldn't let you tie me down
But now that you're gone, girl
(Long gone)
I find it much too hard for me to carry on

I, I, I, I wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
(So that I can let you know, I)
I wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
(So that I can let you know)

Oh, if only I can hear
Your voice so sweet and clear
It would ease my lonely state of mind
Somehow I got to get in touch with you
To let you know
(Let you know, yeah!)

That my love is true
(So true)
I only wish I knew just where to find you
I realize, yeah, yeah
(Realize)
That time is turning the tides
And I'm unsatisfied

I, I, I, I wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
(So that I can let you know, I)
I wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
(So that I can let you know)
There's no hidden plan

Wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
(So that I can let you know, I wish, I wish that I)
I wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
(So that I can let you know)
Just where I stand

I, I, I, I wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
(So that I can let you know, I)
I wish that I could talk to you, baby
So that I can let you know
