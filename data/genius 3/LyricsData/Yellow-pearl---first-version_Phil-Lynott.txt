We all must beware of the yellow pearl
The Yellow Pearl control
Attack, attack, attack, attack
Yellow Pearl
It is foolish to venture into strange enchanted places
If they aren't the places you want to be
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack
Is what we lack
We will arise, we will control
We will command, we will patrol
It is foolish under the guise of love and liberty
That we should capitalize and rob
And fell the poor for the socialistic tree
We will arise, we will control
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack
Is what we lack, that's what you lack
We shall arise, they will arise
We shall control, they will control
We shall command, they will command
We shall patrol, they will patrol
We must fight back, we will arise
They will arise, we will control
We are now living in a situation
Where that self same situation depends on the Yellow Pearl
We will arise, we will control
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack
Is what we lack
We will arise, we will control
We will command, we will patrol
Arise, Yellow Pearl's upon us now
We must fight back
We will arise, we will control
Attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack, attack
Is what we lack, is what we lack
Don't trust in Liberty to save your soul
It is genocide to let liberty lose control
We must decide
