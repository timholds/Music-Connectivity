Words & Music by Hank Snow

Darlin' I am, oh so blue, found the things that I gave you
You returned them when you said that we must part
I have kept them through the years, they are treasured souvenirs
And mark an anniversary of my broken heart

Just a rose from your hair, long ago I placed it there
Tho' it's faded and the petals fall apart
And the fragrance went away, but it's just as sweet today
It marks an anniversary of my broken heart

A golden ring to me so dear, old love letters stained with tears
Had I only known the future from the start
Then there'd be no soul to pine for the love that I thought mine
Or no anniversary of my broken heart

Tho' I know it's all in vain, ev'ry treasure will remain
Even tho' the past has torn my world apart
I kissed your picture, then I cried, for these mem'ries, deep inside
Mark an anniversary of my broken heart
