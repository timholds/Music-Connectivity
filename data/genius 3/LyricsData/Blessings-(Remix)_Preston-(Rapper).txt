[Verse 1: Dan Bull]
Let me set the scene, war is a hellish thing
Hellish as it's ever been, redefine what hellish means
It's Evergreen seeing men killing their fellow beings
Unheavenly screams pierced by deafening machines
Sacrificing actual lives and recompensed in pennies each
Said will this deceptive quest for peace never cease?
Did you ever see a friend in need flee in terror, he
Ebbed and weaved between threats and pleas, a wretch indeed
Wet feet drenched deep in the trench’s heat, each
Feverish skeleton trembling and clenching teeth
Tell me when the death of a wretch was the centrepiece
He’s just another leg wrenched from the centipede
A stampede, a legion proceeding when decreed
Chevaliers, regulars, levied men of every creed
Naïve men of seventeen, each a bel esprit
They’ve had their last meal, their blood’s an aperitif
A fellow dead at the speed at which he fell off his steed
Leaving yet another friend or family member to grieve
Pawns on a board where death is the referee
A living chess piece that’ll never get to Queen
There’s an enemy for every devotee of the regime
For whom doing the obscene extreme is routine
To then ascend the pecking order ‘til you get to chief
Reset the record to the Pleistocene
Beads of sweat, heaving chest, don’t forget to breathe
It seems to be progressive leads to being regressive beasts

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 2: Hopsin]
I'm a radical nuisance, and I'm back on my bullshit
Went from lashing on ruthless to hanging rappers from nooses
You ain't gotta like me, but like a magnet and you stick
Breaking these niggas was easy like snapping a toothpick
Your whole gimmick's a fraud, you just casting illusions
That's how niggas get ran up on and cracked with a broomstick
Watch what my promo does to your whole buzz, you're dead
I don't show no love to homo thugs
My haters never show they face, they usually try to hide, but when they see me at my shows, I'm who they truly idolize. (I LOVE YOU!) I keep a handful of ugly groupies I deny, knowing if they ever showed up at my crib by surprise. (What the fuck?)

I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I
I haven't had a good time in a long time, you know I
I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
Way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 3: Preston]
My Dad he just left, I'm the man of the house
Mum had a paddy, he left now I'm stuck with a frown, down
And this new kid here, he say he from outta town
I don't care who he is, I just don't want him around
He just rammed my foot into the taxi door
Lookin' like Raja Ram with his shabby coat
He be the virus I be antidote
He be callin' my gruff like he Billy Goat
Callin' his bluff, I swear he an epidemic
My mum stopped paying' gas and electric
She at the pub using more cups than Anna Kendrick
He got kicked out the school he began attendin'
Stop worrying 'bout whoever's next
But the define drama that we ingest
I think I've ingested enough, I don't need any more stress
Shit feel like Zac and Danny don't work together
You tore the game apart, who put it back together? I

[Hook: Drake (Big Sean)]
I'm here for a good time, not a long time, you know I

I'm way up, I feel blessed
Way up, I feel blessed (Straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed (Straight up, straight up)
I'm way up, I feel blessed

[Verse 4: Token]
You can tell I got the Jewish awkward nose
What the fuck is up with that I’m obnoxious bone?
Look at the amount that my nostrils hold
None of you motherfuckers are strong as those
I got a bodybuilder on my face!
Step to me, I’ll smell you from miles away
Eureka! You reek of
Weak talent that needs practice
And cheap fabric that needs fashion
Extreme yapping that needs action
And mean bragging that needs absence
You reek of sadnesses
I reek of savage
You reek of has-been
I reek havoc
Look, performing when the moons out, meetings during the daytime
I sat down with Genius, they sat down with one at the same time
I broke down my lyrics, I’m the only one that can break mine
At 17 I told the label that I grew up listening to that I can’t sign
They don’t want me to sound underground, well they don’t know I’m a landline
