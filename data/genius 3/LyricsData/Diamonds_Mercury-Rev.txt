Look how the sun, captured by the rain
Glimmers and falls, and lands in golden balls
Like a bracelet hung, from a spider's web
For me to show to you, like gifts

That you won't forget...
For as long as you live...

See how the rain, captured by the leaves
Shimmers and falls, and lives on in diamond balls
Like a necklace hung, over limb and branch
For me to show to you, like gifts

That you won't forget...
For as long as you live...

Watch how the stars, captured by the sky
Appear to die, before our eyes and live on, in other ways
Well tonite they're mine, for me to show
For me to shower you, like gifts

That you won't forget...
For as long as you live...
And you will always have...
For I will always give them...
To you
