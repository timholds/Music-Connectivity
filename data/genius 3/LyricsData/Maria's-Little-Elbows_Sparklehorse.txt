Well I'll bet my Maria's got an elbow full of lonely
Now here's a little prayer so that she might get some sleep
Don't let her face be skinned by the sun today
Don't let it in when it comes knocking at your door

Loneliness
Loneliness
Loneliness
Oh oh

Sometimes you feel you've got the emptiest arms in the whole world
Try to make sense but it always comes out absurd
Sleeping horses keep eating up your flowers
Don't let 'em in when it comes kicking at your door

Loneliness
Loneliness
Loneliness
Oh
Came kicking at my door

She said 'I've really come to hate my body
And all the things that it requires in this world'
I bet you're out there getting drunk with all your friends
And it'll get you in the bathroom of a Texaco

Loneliness
Loneliness
Loneliness
Oh
Came kicking at my door
