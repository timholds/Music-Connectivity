A grain of sand
How did I find you?
A blade of grass
How did I find you?
A speck of dust
A shard of glass

I keep falling in love with you every day
You're the one that I knew I'd find
And every moment we spend is another away
This love's for life

A flake of snow
How did you find me?
A whisk of light
How did you find me?
I know each song
A stitch in time

I keep falling in love with you
I keep falling in love with you every day
You're the one that I knew I'd find
And every moment we spend is another away
This love's for life

Did you ever think you'd meet somebody that you've known forever
Someone knew we'd be together

A grain of sand
A blade of grass

I keep falling in love with you every day
You're the one that I knew I'd find
And every moment we spend is another away
This love's for life

I keep falling in love with you every day
You're the one that I knew I'd find someday
And every moment we spend is another away
This love's for life

I keep falling in love with you
I keep falling in love with you
I keep falling in love with you
