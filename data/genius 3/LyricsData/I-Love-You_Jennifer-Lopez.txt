I love you! with all my heart
& until i die we'll never be apart
If you feel the same let me know
& if you don't let me go
I call you every night just to here you say hi
Then i hang up & close my eyes
I have a vision of you & me holdin hands
I hear us makin future plans
I love to see you smie
You make everything worth while
I love it when you hold me tight
You never bring me to tears
With you i share my dreams,secrets,& fears
When i'm with you i know i'm in love
I know god sent you from up above
You never tell me a lie
You're the perfect guy
Even when you act crazy
I tell everyone "that's my baby"
I will never deny the love i have for you
But tell me do you love me too
It's you that i will always admire
You're my hopes dreams & my one desire
My life before you was never this great
I'm happy free & i have faith
I wish i could die
Standing by your side
I wanna be your wife
For the rest of my life
I'm the only girl for you in this world
So promise there won't be another girl
If i ever lost you i would brake down in cry
& forever i would hide
If i cried you'd care
If i was hurt you'd be there
I just wanna let you know
That i would forever more
Love you so
