I waited each day for your letter although I knew what it would cost
But dear when it came I knew that your game
Had been won and I knew that I had lost
But I just couldn't open your letter I know you're no longer my own
The moment it came I wrote beneath my name
These heart-breaking words address unknown
[ piano ]
I wanted to open your letter to see if you missed me sometimes
But you have a way of making me pay
Cause I know what you write between the lines
You know I'd be so glad to see you in spite of the hurt you have done
But deep down inside I can't lose my pride
And forgive you just because you are the one
So I just couldn't open your letter...
