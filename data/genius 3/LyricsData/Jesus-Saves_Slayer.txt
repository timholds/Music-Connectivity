[Verse 1]
You go to the church, you kiss the cross, you will be saved at any cost
You have your own reality, Christianity
Spend your life just kissing ass, a trait that's grown as time has passed
Think the world will end today, you praise the Lord, it's all you
Say

[Chorus]
Jesus saves, listen to you pray
You'll see the pearly gates, when death takes you away

[Verse 2]
For all respect you cannot lust, in an invisible man you place your trust
Indirect dependency, eternal attempt at amnesty
He will decide who lives and dies, depopulate Satan as rise
You will be an accessory, irreverence and blasphemy

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Jesus saves, no words of praise
No promised land to take you to, there is no other way
