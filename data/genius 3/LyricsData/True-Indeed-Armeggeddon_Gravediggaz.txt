[Intro: Poetic]
Captain's log... it's life
1 million suffer, I fear that
The end is near, and attempt to describe

[Chorus 3X: Poetic & Frukwan]
True indeed, true indeed
True indeed, true indeed
True indeed, life is hell in Armageddon

[Poetic]
It's '97, life is damn near concluded
Brain cells are booted, sperm cells are muted
Blood cells deluted, and water's poluted
Shops that you do, replaced by computers
Pigman's ammuted, government intruders
Removed with big snipers and shooters
The righteous are booted in the camper
Destined to be damper, where ankles are kept in field
Hunger and crept like the, mentrual of women
Children be swimmin in plasma
Cuz the devil won't allow you to have a
More then two babies, maybe the scenario is crazy
But three years from now, you paraphrase me
Hitler is alive, cuz hate that size never dies
It's a more to lies, in other lives
Armageddon is a blood bath
Many men's heart will collide in the slugs path
Luciferian clappers, the black men and Arians clash
All humanitarians are placed in a sanitarium fast
Big boroughs among us, my reputation mix to alide invictions
Caught it soft

[Frukwan]
As soon as it injects, small as an insect
Sinks to the womb, irretatin the fetus
Airborne planes with ultra rays
Aerosol sprays leavin tracemarks, you're picked up on radar
Trackin your moments, political opponents
Everythin you own now, he owns it, from the genesis exact off the tip
Undergoin metamorphosis through computers in your offices
From a crystal, construct a nuclear missile
Every fifth school we produce more pistols
Worldwide, it's suicide, better due then to die when the race will collide
Documented details, shocked at retails, shipped to the ghetto for resale
Peep the calamitist dreams and destroy the thermometers
Droppin like niggas unemployed (True indeed, God...)

[Chorus 2X]

[Poetic]
Magnetic strips are fixed on to plastic
The cosmetic tricks and triple six is established
The alchemist flips in the myst of the mases
Hah, and laughs at the fact society is cashless
Blackfist and witchcraft is practiced and preached
Cuz the masked beauty that bleaches ya optics
With fibers, topics of file and fiction
To lessen affiction, my children beware the pale lighter
Behold the cold heart, cash days is faded
Only Visa Gold card stashes pay ya wages
Smash cars wit microchips, chocalized denim
Reveal who's regestered in the New World system (indeed...)

[Chorus 4X]

[Outro: Frukwan]
You better clean yo self
Yeah, yeah, you better clean yo self
Cuz you can't depend on nobody else
Yo, you better clean ya self
Cuz you can't depend on nobody else
Best to clean yo self
Cuz you can't depend on nobody else

[Chorus 3X]
