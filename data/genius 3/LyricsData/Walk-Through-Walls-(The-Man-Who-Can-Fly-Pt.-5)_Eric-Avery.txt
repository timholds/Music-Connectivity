I want to watch the pile of wreckage
Lay down in flames to warm and dry
I can’t remember the last time that I was chosen
Special honorary undercover

I can walk through walls and I can fly
And that’s not all
I’ve drunk the oceans dry and that left me all powerful
But that’s no help at all when you won’t see
You won’t see me

Nothing ever hurts me now that I am golden
The future holds a bright light in my eye
Pluck me from the streets and ignite me blinding
Smooth the sheets, polish the glass and regard the light

I can walk through walls and I can fly
And that’s not all
I’ve drunk the oceans dry and that left me all powerful
But that’s no help at all when you won’t see
You won’t see me

I can feel in my veins the power of the people
I can feel the almighty and the power of people
I can feel my veins, I can feel the rush
I feel the power washing over us
I feel it lifting up, feel it dusting off
Feel the low green pulse that pushes up through everything
Lose myself to see again

I have a secret, I’ll keep it secret
‘Cause when I bite my tongue it tastes so good to me
