[Intro]
It's all fun and games, till!
Hail up the East London massive, South London, North London, West London
Fire!

[Verse 1]
This ain't your place
This ain't your race
You're not a G on the mic, yeah that's waste
I've been alive in the game for the last great hype
But nobody knows your face in these times
Are you serious?
These times are treacherous
You ain't hearing us
Never seen the last spitter who stopped for too long
Hop on the mic and step near to us
I'm steady on them it's a'ight
Would you really want the mic is
Course you got a hype for the nisai
I'm not a prick I will out your lizai
Turn the chains, spitters ain't getting no strizaips
I'm like water, flowing through your prizaips
Supplying the homes, and you need these lizaits
Been here before
Been here for sure
I been here for beef
I been here for dope
And if a war I connect all four
Like cities on a tour
Not a shit spitter, witty but I'm raw
I never see another spitter kick another door
They be sleeping on the floor when I rip another door
Suck your mum cuz, that's what I want to say
So what do you want to do blood? What do you want to say?
Like "What did he say?"
That's what I said
You know I never pet to get a sound boy dead
Gimme a plus one I roll with the
Sklakum!
I got money and a brain
I pack 'em!
I asked D double E if I'm bad on the mic
If he ever said no I will clap him!
I ain't lying
Everybody want to kill me off, I ain't dying
Stop trying
Stop running your mouth, and stop lying
I ransack everybody's house, walk out and tell my hood dons
"It's your time to fly in"

[Verse 2]
Look how my life's been
You ain't gotta see the life I seen but you dream
I believe and I just can't leave
And you're just a distant memory MC
I be like, "please"
God knows we ain't the same pedigree or degree
So I say "Why me?"
Yeah cause it's me
Plus at no time at all will I ever be a fool
If me and you ain't cool back your tool
Cause I don't want to see anybody act the fool
Don't need anybody to come and clap the tool
Oh God I'm like "Oh gosh"
Come a long way from the old shops
I just want to flow off
I think I hate but I known of
When it gets down to spitting I don't prolong
I don't brag but I'm badder than them
I might seem sane but I'm madder than them
Hail up my people sat in the pen
It's an E3 kid and I'm back in the ends
When I'm up and my band's back in the Benz
On the way to West London, catching the Thames
I catch a vibe when I'm back at my friends
I do a bit of this a bit of that in the end
I say "It's all fun and games, you're nothing on earth"
Half of these people are bluffing on earth
I didn't know how to handle praise, well that's why I started puffing on earth
I know Skunky the Monkey
And high-grade bless
Not registering tire
I mean Highgate sess
High-grade sess, cause
My name's Wiley, I'm the best
Yes!

[Verse 3]
I kick your head and curve it like Beckham
And I control the mic fight like Tekken
Bet you thought you were winning for a second
'Till I ran and put it better than a spitter in a second
I'm a teacher, I teach you a lesson
Murk them at my own discretion
And I tell everybody
I'm not the only one whose life on Earth got messing
Your flow's borrowed
I get a lot of things, but mainly get followed
We can be grown men about this
Or we can be children, you will get hollowed
Your flow's borrowed
I get a lot of things in life, but get followed
We can be grown men about this
Or we can be children about this, you will get hollowed!

[Outro]
Yeah!
Its all fun and games
Tell!
