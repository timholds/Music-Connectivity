There's no salvation
In a world where you worship proven fiction
And no redemption for a life of servitude
You bow and you heed
Unhallowed command
Your only care is the money we gain
It's the same place
A hollow escape
A palace of concrete and glass
Keep waiting, keep waiting
For no god
To erase you
No god
To make you fall to your knees

There's blood on these pages
And the war inside your head
Is with yourself
Through the ages, through every form of "Hell"
It's the same face
A hollow escape
A palace of concrete and glass
Keep waiting, keep waiting
For no god
To consume you
No god
To bear your burden
No god
To use you
No god
There is only illusion

The usurper of life
It'll bleed every last drop
And it'll suck all the breath out of you
And leave you forsaken

There's no god
To release you
There's no god
To make you fall down to your knees
There's no god
To deceive you
There's no god
To bear your burden
There's no god
There's no god
There's no god
There is only illusion
