[Hook: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

(Verse 1: Oddsox)
I toss and turn, I'm stuck in dreams
I can barely breath I'm weak, sleep is just a luxury
I'm overwhelmed, Not what it seems
Mind is always racing forward, happiness a fallacy
That I can't reach because my dreams are high up in the clouds
Write a song I'm overjoyed I'm never coming down
One criticism later I am six feet underground
With the masterpiece I wrote, burnt alive it won't be found
So scared about opinions that releasing songs is fiction
Swear that I will make it I'm a walking contradiction
Everything about this game I love it, it's addiction
Its coursing through my veins I go insane I live in sickness
It's my drug can't get enough, Insomniac will self destruct
My stomach churning, mind is overbearing but we call this love
Now I put my head upon the pillow and just try to sleep
Criticism don't exist inside my perfect dream

[Hook: Sampha]
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
There's no need for us to rush it through
Don't think about it too much, too much, too much, too much
This is more than just a new lust for you
(Oohh, don't think about..)

(Verse 2: Mavin)
