[verse 1]
She gone away, mad ting
I know I can't be, but I'm relaxing
I should just holla, I can't though
Cos I'm a star-boy like Mavado
Nuff gyal around me
I got them vybzing, they run around me
So anytime anybody ever gets caught at cheating
You'll be in your yard, repeating

[Chorus]
Since you went away, I've had a problem
I can't sleep at night and it's cos I miss you
I can find someone, but I don't wanna
I might lose my mind and it's cos I miss you

[verse 2]
Said I wouldn't do it a million times
Then I done it another million times
I can't talk no more I reply
When you move on, I'm gonna wanna die
Here's the cycle of life
Might end up with more than one wife
Might end up in trouble and strife
In your front room thinking "why?"
Singing

[Chorus]
Since you went away, I've had a problem
I can't sleep at night and it's cos I miss you
I can find someone, but I don't wanna
I might lose my mind and it's cos I miss you

[verse 3]
I dissed you, now I miss you
I loved you, now I hate you
I don't want to, but I rate you
See you beside I would hate to
Plus in this life you gotta make do
With the cards you dealt and where they take you
What don't break you, will make you
Next part of your life, like phase 2

[Chorus]
Since you went away, I've had a problem
I can't sleep at night and it's cos I miss you
I can find someone, but I don't wanna
I might lose my mind and it's cos I miss you

[verse 4]
She gone away, mad ting
I know I can't be, but I'm relaxing
I should just holla, I can't though
Cos I'm a star-boy like Mavado
Nuff gyal around me
I got them vybzing, they run around me
So anytime anybody ever gets caught at cheating
You'll be in your yard, repeating
