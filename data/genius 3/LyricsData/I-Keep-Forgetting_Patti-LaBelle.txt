I keep forgettin' we're not in love anymore
I keep forgettin' things will never be the same again
I keep forgettin' how you made that so clear
I keep forgettin'

Every time you're near
Every time I see you smile
Hear your 'Hello'
Saying you can only stay a while

Hey, I know that it's hard for you
To say the things
That we both know are true
But tell me how come

Every time I hear
How you never want to live a lie
How it's gone to far
And you don't have to tell me why

Why you're gone and the game is through
If this is what's real
If this is what's true
Tell me how come

Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that
I know you're not mine
Anymore, anyway, anytime
But tell me how come

Don't say that, don't say that, don't say that
I know you're not mine
Anymore, anyway, anytime
But tell me how come
