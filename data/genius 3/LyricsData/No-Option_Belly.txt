[Intro]
Yeah!
Up for days, nigga

[Verse 1]
It's the ones you keep close, that hurt you the most
I'm drinking on my own, doing a personal toast
Probably fucked your bitch, and you ain't even know it
I should probably wash my dick with detergent and soap
Ridin' round the city with my vision blurry
Back to back Benz's, nigga his and hers
Million dollar pussy, you should get insured
I hit the town and watch the city burn
Had the keys, had the city locked
Hit the pussy do the Diddy Bop
Before the beard was all ZZ Top
When me and Sal was eating dinner off a TV box

[Pre-Hook]
Find the cancer, then you cut em' off
See my daddy was a dealer and my momma said it's rubbing off
Somebody tell me what the tunnel costs
Cause I've been burning bridges
Give a fuck how I come across

[Hook]
Said "I love you", that's the drugs talking
Heard em' hating, that's the love talking
Hand to god you left me no option
Swear to god y'all left me no option
Who left the drugs on the table? (who?)
Who left these hoes in my house? (who?)
Who left this dope in my couch?
Ho don't you open your mouth

[Verse 2]
Changed up had the curve from pitching the weight
Either way I'm about to ball like I'm missing the plate
Boy you never touched base, I'm calling you out
Though we never seen you out, you was playing it safe
Call me Judas priest, now she got some new beliefs
Photo shoot in like a week, she won't even eat
Dreams of winning got me losing sleep
Versace sheets just to watch Medusa sleep
Up for days, I've been up for days
Mixin' up the love and hate, that's a double date
Dope wave thatâ€™s my lane call me Mr.Bang
Renegade mixing up the batch with the lemonade

[Pre-Hook]
Cut em' off
Seen my daddy was a dealer and my momma said its rubbing off
Somebody tell me what the tunnel costs
Cause I've been burning bridges
Give a fuck how I come across

[Hook]
Said "I love you", that's the drugs talking
Heard em' hating, that's the love talking
Hand to god you left me no option
Swear to god y'all left me no option
Who left the drugs on the table? (who?)
Who left these hoes in my house? (who?)
Who left this dope in my couch? (you?)
Ho don't you open your mouth
