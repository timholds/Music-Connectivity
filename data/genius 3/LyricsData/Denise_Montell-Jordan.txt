Intro
Boy: uncle montelly yo..
May you please read us a story please
Montell: nah
I don't feel much like telling a story today kid
Girl: please, read us a story
Montell: I said no kid
Both kids: please! Read us a story
Montell: okay..here we go

Verse I
Now listen to the words that I say
Cause this type of song will take you back in the day
It all started back in cali-from-I-A
Where the khakis hang low and gangbangers don't play
Put on my drawers
Walked down the hall
Kissed my apollonian poster on the wall
My first day of high school, on my way
"You need to eat your breakfast?)
Mom I am late
…funky fresh, stepped into the school
And that's when I say her standing with this dude
Young, tender, sweet denise
To take her on a date you need a $1000 at least
Plus she's used to dating dope dealers
Cats with felonies who tote heaters
You won't believe what's in the 2nd verse
You better buckle up, its bout to get worse

Chorus
Can't believe that that's Denise
The one from high school
With the dope body
But now she is out there going for broke
And all her dreams went up in smoke
(Repeat 2X)

Verse II
2 years later, and things have changed
Hip hop evolved into a whole new game
NWA7s holding down my block
Denise graduated the school of hard knocks
She made a few connects
Didn't skip a beat
Got a little deeper hooked up on the street
And wherever they led her, she would follow
Now she rocks fashions like a runway model
Jewelry, Louis, Gucci and guess
Delivering more packages than UPS
From Miami to NY
Sometimes to Rome
But niecy always seemed to make it back home
Now I am 18 and to my surprise
Niecy got babies by 2 different guys
And cause of dem kids she ain't moving the same
She put herself out there
Who's to blame?

Chorus

Bridge
She's not a superwoman nah
She is not that kind of girl that you can lay down
And think that everything is ok
She's only human, oh
This girl is always on the go
Hurt on occasional
Used by so many dudes

Verse III
Aww! Poor Denise
She's out on the streets
But that's not how I'll end this story
You kind of got to use your imagination
To figure out Niecy's situation
…I'll tell you this….its not that great
She's got an addiction that she just can't shake
From rags to riches, riches to rags
The story of Denise is so so sad
