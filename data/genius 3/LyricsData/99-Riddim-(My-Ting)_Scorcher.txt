[Verse 1: Scorcher]
Look, I don't put work in with girls
I just put work on the scales, I ain't no chief
I don't buy drinks for the links
But I paid for my girl's hair, paid for my girl's nails
I don't give a fuck about Chris
I'm with Charmaine and Chanel
I'm with Misha and Chantelle
I might switch Misha with Danielle
I might teef man ah man's girl
I don't wanna hear about them
I don't wanna chat about me
I don't wanna talk
If I've got P, I want more
If I've got one, I want two
If I've got three, I want four
I don't give a shit about this
I don't give a fuck about that
Threw food one time when I saw a couple like slash
But I got the money right back
Yo, cuh I'm a lower E don, you know
Go anywhere and I'll take John, you know
Got an iPhone and I've got a Nokia
It goes ring, ring, ring and don't stop, you know
Like I said, I've got it on lock here
And the shoebox filled to the top here
My brudda got a new- for the opps, you know
So it's on top when I get the drop, you know

[Hook: Scorcher]
Cuh you know I've got my ting
You know I'm on my ting
And you know I've got my ting
Know I'm on my ting
And know I've got my ting
And know I'm on my ting
Cuh you know I've got my ting
You know I'm on my ting
And you know I've got my ting
Know I'm on my ting
And know I've got my ting
And know I'm on my ting

[Verse 2: Mercston]
Yeah, triple A, exactly
All they know about triple A is batteries
I'm in the best bit, me, Rocket and Stormzy
Scorch with the [?] I said I was gonna take one for the-
Said I'mma be on the wing like Belasie
But no false gyal ever [?] catch me (are you mad?)
All the money's here in elastics (fall back)
Could all make the gyal dem flash tits
Balenciaga runners, could've bought a runner
You ain't gotta ask, I kill it every summer
If you spud my man, then I see him on the come-up
But I should be on the cover of every cover
Ain't a debate, nor is it up for one
What the fuck, you want a one-on-one?
On my mother's and my son's, ain't easy to get spun
[?] only one
I'm an E3 don, you know, went Bow
Boys could've went blessed gyal, you know
Gyal dem know I've got a lot of gyal, yeah, I send 'nough pics
Might have seen it on Tumblr
Got the weed and the crumbler
Billing something, what the bumbaclart?
Hey, hold on, what the bumbaclart?
I'm the main event, not the undercut
Book me, I better dun the dance

[Hook: Scorcher]
Cuh you know I've got my ting
You know I'm on my ting
And you know I've got my ting
Know I'm on my ting
And know I've got my ting
And know I'm on my ting
Cuh you know I've got my ting
You know I'm on my ting
And you know I've got my ting
Know I'm on my ting
And know I've got my ting
And know I'm on my ting

[Verse 3: Ghetts]
Who? What? Why? When?
Man are too hot times ten
Driving up the embankment
[?] clocked my Benz (come again?)
Driving up the embankment
With a huge clock like Ben (what dem say?)
That was the attraction
That's your view, not my lens, eh, brudda?
It's GH from the east side
Let them know where I'm from
You can go ask what I'm doing round here
Me ah go mek them know what I'm on
I've got one or two links from way down the road
Dem gyal right over there
Dem gyal don't wanna fuck none of you niggas
Dem gyal wanna come over here
You don't know how far man have come from, you know
I'm from Newham, but I'm popular
'Nuff gyal have been raring from this cock, you know
All my niggas have been stepping on boxes
Playing hopscotch, you know
Yo, I've never been a cock block, you know
I just drop the bloodclart top on you
Have a boy's girl like "boy, watch him, now"
Dot-to-dot, I connect the dots, you know
No cotton, I'm so rotten
With no wallet, I go shopping
One card in my coat pocket
But I can get a lot of dough from it

[Hook: Scorcher]
Cuh you know I've got my ting
You know I'm on my ting
And you know I've got my ting
Know I'm on my ting
And know I've got my ting
And know I'm on my ting
Cuh you know I've got my ting
You know I'm on my ting
And you know I've got my ting
