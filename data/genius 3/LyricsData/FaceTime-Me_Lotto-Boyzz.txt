[Intro]
AYD, Are You Dumb Boy?

[Chorus: Ash]
And I don't really like typing
Babe just FaceTime me
And I ain't talking about no iPhone
Baby I got time for somebody (somebody)
And I don't really like them brothers in your contacts
Baby I wanna make contact, I beg you tell me how you got your bum fat
Turn around bust gunshots
FaceTime me, girl I'm trynna get turnt up
FaceTime me, and leave them niggas on whatsapp
FaceTime me, we can't just be friends
So are you gonna FaceTime me or wah?

[Verse 1: Lucas]
A lot of niggas bugging but she really find me cool
I had a crush for ages, I've known this girl from school
The way that back move, make any brother turn fool
But you know I'm Lotto Lucci so I gotta play it cool
So when it's late night, hit me on the FaceTime
I don't wanna voicecall, Imma hit the decline
Pattern up your camera let me see you and your waistline
Even if your no-makeup with your head tied

Fresh up out the shower lemme see you in the lingerie
And you know that I've been waiting for you all day
Show me cake, show me cake like it's my birthday
And off the dirt imma probably swing your way

Started with an ickie, then we got busy
After hour face concerning it's turning sticky
It's lotto lucas but she call lotto lucci
And she don't rate them other man because they move bookey

[Chorus: Ash]
And I don't really like typing
Babe just FaceTime me
And I ain't talking about no iPhone
Baby I got time for somebody (somebody)
And I don't really like them brothers in your contacts
Baby I wanna make contact, I beg you tell me how you got your bum fat
Turn around bust gunshots
FaceTime me, girl I'm trynna get turnt up
FaceTime me, and leave them niggas on whatsapp
FaceTime me, we can't just be friends
So are you gonna FaceTime me or wah?

[Verse 2: Ash]
We can't deal with no paigon friend
I love the way that Mercedes bends
And I've been kinda weak for a while
Baby I been working, needing sleep for a while
And she say one shot, two then three, baby I need some for me
And the henny in your system make your knees go weak
I need come for me, company
I see her in the ends, but her body's from the west indies, yeah, yeah
And all them other niggas in a hurry but she already left with me, yeah
Oh my, hiding when she sober, drink up, have a drink and you can come over, know I take my time when I controlla, tell me when you're coming over

[Chorus: Ash]
