[Intro/ Pre-Chorus]
1, 2, 3, 4 to the floor
I give blood for blood
But you want more
1, 2, 3, 4 to the floor
I give blood for blood
Not more

[Strophe 1]
Forever yours
From head to feet
Till the breaking dawn
In the lustful heat

Tonight I'll love you forever (Blood!)
When I go down and eat (Blood!)
Hot sweat in black leather (Blood!)
We're moving to the beat

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Until the end of night
I will always be your whore
Until the sun will shine
I give blood for blood
Not more

[Strophe 2]
It's not a game
This love is true
When you scream my name
Both of you

You are going commando (Blood!)
Let us trick and treat (Blood!)
It takes two to Tango (Blood!)
We're moving to the beat

[Pre-Chorus]
