I look in your eyes and I can see
You've loved so dangerously
You're not trusting your heart to anyone...
You tell me you're gonna play it smart
We're through before we start
But I believe that we've only just begun
When it's this good there's no saying no
I want you so I'm ready to go
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For just to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
I know you're afraid of what you feel
Your still need time to heal
And I could help if you'll only let me try
You touched me and something in me knew
What I could have with you
Now I'm not ready to say goodbye
When it's this good there's no saying no
I need you so I'm ready to go
Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For just to be with you I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire, through whatever come what may
For a chance at loving you, I'd take it all the way...
Right down to the wire, even through the fire
Through the fire, to the limit, through the fire, through whatever
