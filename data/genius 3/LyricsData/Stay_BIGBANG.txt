Can you feel me now
Take a deep breath and let me explain
All the pain that's been wreckin' my brain
Gettin so close to goin' insane
And see you standing there
And the feelin' never gonna be the same
Seems like we missed the whole damn train
Blame is all we have for us

And I can let in get in the way
Even if the love is the costly price to pay
Lookin' back life love was the game or cliche
Gotta move away sacrifice my heart and let you breath again baby girl

Oso sugita nani mo kamo
Kanojo ga tokidoki damatta no mo

Soba ni ite kureru koto

Tobira ga shimaru mae ni Baby please don't go away
Ienakatta koto semeteru What you to stay
Ima sara kuyandemo I know it's late
Kanojo no kawari nante dare ni mo dekinai
I want you to stay want you to stay

Saigo no kotoba wa sou
Sayonara nanka ja naku 'arigatou'
Owari no imi
Getting over me

Kanojo ga hoshii mono wo
Boku ga agerare nakatta shouko
Posuto no Key
End of the story

Hitori no heya ni mo mou sugu

Shashin de hohoemu kanojo mo

Wasurerareru wakenai Baby please don't fade away
Yonroku toki chuu kienai kara Want you to stay
Konna ni kanashikute I know it's late
Mamoru beki datta no wa kanojo no sonzai
I want you to stay want you to stay
