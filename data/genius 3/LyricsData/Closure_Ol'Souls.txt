[Pre Hook: Tayo]
One two one two, mic check
You shouldn't let him talk to you like that
I can tell he dont appreciate ya
I might just have to alleviate ya
Cuz it all could be so simple
Throw your emotions out the window
All you gotta do is let me take control oh, oh, ohhh

[Hook: Tayo]
He won't be your last, I can guarantee
So take my hand and follow me
Don't wanna be your man, I wanna set ya free
I'll be your closure if you let me take control
(Repeat)

[Verse 1: Tayo]
Beautiful, it's your cue to to go
Far away from your lost love cubicle
Maybe we can take a ride to the studio
So I can write rhymes while you work on your cuticles
You know, good times and white wine
Dim lights and good music right vibes
Hit the park after dark watch the night sky
And what feels like a lifetime
And we can do it all night long
We can do whatever you want to
And we can do it all night long
No telling what we gon' do
Babygirl it all could be so simple
Throw your emotions out the window
All you gotta do is let me take control oh, oh, ohhh

[Hook: Tayo]
He won't be your last, I can guarantee
So take my hand and follow me
Don't wanna be your man, I wanna set ya free
I'll be your closure if you let me take control
(Repeat)

[Verse 2: Raw]
Here we go with this back and forth ish, forfeit
I ain't playing but
Out having a ball thats where I caught ya
Saw ya in that little tight dress turning up knew it had to go down down
Had to go down down
Trouble when you came round
Had to hit it with that thing up face down
Only time we get along
Always going thru my phone
Like whats your code?
Cuffing that was wrong, detective all along
She prolly at my show wanna see who Im taking home
But she still gonna sing along
Cuz she say Im so dope but, but...

[Pre Hook: Tayo]
Girl it all could be so simple
Throw your emotions out the window
All you gotta do is let me take control oh, oh, ohhh

[Hook: Tayo]
He won't be your last, I can guarantee
So take my hand and follow me
Don't wanna be your man, I wanna set ya free
I'll be your closure if you let me take control
