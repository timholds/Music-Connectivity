I can be the sunshine today
I'll be there to help you go on your way
I can be the sweet moonlight
I'll be there to guide you through the night
I'll be there to keep you warm, in the rain
I can make you happy again and again
There's no broken heart you can't mend
It's really easy and you will understand

Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I will care
Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I will care

If you're feeling lost and alone
I'll be there to help you carry on
If you're feeling blue and need a friend
I'll be there to lend you a helping hand
If you feel like losing your pride
I'll be there to give you a place you can hide
If you feel like your life's going wrong
I'll be there to give you someone to lean on

Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I will care
Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I'll be there
Say a word and I will care

Life will be better
So open up your eyes now
Life will be better
We can stand together as one
Life will be better
Together we can change the whole world
Life will be better

Oh yeah Say a word
