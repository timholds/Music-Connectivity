If you want it
You've got to come get it

If you need some sugar
Come on baby come on

I've got everything that you could ever need
I've got the kind of love that can bring you down to your knees (right)

Sweeter than candy, Like honey to a honeybee

And I know that I want you
And I know that you want me

It's so hot, so hot
And what you want, is what I've got
I'm on fire
Oh baby I'm on fire

It's a heat wave

And everything that I touch I blaze
I'm leaving every player in a daze

I'm on fire
Oh baby I'm on fire

Can you feel me coming babe
Can you feel the heat
Like a hot summer day babe
I'm walking down the street with just my bare feet

Can you feel my love
Coming down like rain
'Cuz once you get a taste baby
It'll never be the same

'Cuz I know that I want you
And I know that you want me

I'm so hot, so hot
And what you want is what I've got

I'm on fire, oh baby I'm on fire

It's a heat wave
And everything that I touch I blaze
I'm leaving every player in a daze

I'm on fire
Oh baby I'm on fire
I'm burning up

You've got me burning, (yea)
Burning for your love baby
You've got me burning
And I just can't get enough

You've got me burning, (yea)
Burning for your love baby
You've got me burning
And I just can't get enough

I'm burning baby from the heat
, can't you feel my warm desire
Because it's taking over me

So hot, so hot
And what you want is what I've got
I'm on fire
Oh baby I'm on fire

And everything that I touch I blaze
I'm leaving every player in a daze

I'm on fire
Oh baby I'm on fire
