Out of sight, do it
The people rose and set off for the sun
At night they read their star signs
A people proud for they know their kingdom come
Their skin was tanned by moonshine

Got to keep-a-movin'
Got to keep-a-movin' on
Got to keep-a-movin'
Got to keep-a-movin' on
Got to keep-a-movin'
Got to keep-a-movin' on

I know now why they gone and it's all past
There come a European
His love was good but his lust, it lingered last
And stuck like a devil demon

Got to keep-a-movin'
Got to keep-a-movin' on
Got to keep-a-movin'
Got to keep-a-movin' on
Got to keep-a-movin'
Got to keep-a-movin' on

On lonely nights you can hear the distant call
And good hearts hear the rhythm
And now I know pride before a fall
On the road to freedom

Got to keep-a-movin'
Got to keep-a-movin' on
Got to keep-a-movin'
Got to keep-a-movin' on
Got to keep-a-movin'
Got to keep-a-movin' on

Woh, woh, woh, woh, now
I'm an insider, baby (or "Human inside, baby"?)
So long, baby
Goodbye
