[Hook x2]
Yeah' I'm tryna turn this into somethin'
Turn this into somethin'
Yeah' I'm tryna to turn this into somethin'
Turn this into somethin'
And we ain't tripping on the summer 'cause the stars out
Chrome wheels, candy paint, bring the broads out

[Verse 1]
Yeah I'm tryna turn this into somethin' on the go
Holler at my partner for some drank that I could pour
Sippin', candy dripping while I'm tippin' on them vogues
Horizontal sideways trunk might explode
Headed to the spot where the strippers show me love
Cause they got them fire wings and I love to grub
Trying to get my mind off my bitch back at home
Searching for a freaky bopper dying to turn me on

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Yeah I'm tryna turn this into somethin' for the night
Gotta play it safe drop my bait while she bite
She sucking and she fucking well, that's just my type
It's something about that pussy when it's gushy under lights
She claims she knows my name and she seen me out in public
Finally got the nerve to speak to me cause she been crushin'
Agreeing in whatever that I tell her she'll bust it
I showed her what I'm bout and turned her out soon as I touched it

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]
Yeah I'm tryna turn this into somethin' cause she bout it
Pimpin' put her in submission she could never doubt it
Stock legs, corn bread fed, she a stallion
Drank in my tank turn me up to a thousand
Crank it to the max while she shake it from the back
Claiming that she dyin' I'mma hit her with this 'Lac
Told her turn around and scrub the ground to the beat
Set that ass on my lap and whisper this to me

[Hook x2]
