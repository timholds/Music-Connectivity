*clapping, barking, and somebody yells "Yo whassup??!"*

[Lawrence Krisna Parker]
One two
Rap music, what does it mean
What is everybody in this industry for
What is everybody, buying rap for
Why do people get involved, in rap music
Rap music number one, is the voice of black people, number one
Number two, it's the LAST voice, of black people
Black people have created every music you hear out here in the streets today
Every single music, rock and roll down
Therefore; in a situation that has, all African music in it
All African music, uhh, exploiting itself of it, or coming out of it
All African influence in all it's music
And you have what is called American Music Awards
You have what is called theft
And what I would like to bring out today is rap music
As, a revolutionary tool in changing the structure of racist America
