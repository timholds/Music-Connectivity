Away in a manger, no crib for His bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay

The cattle are lowing, the poor Baby wakes
But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes
I love Thee, Lord Jesus, look down from the sky
And stay by thy cradle 'til morning is nigh

Be near me, Lord Jesus, I ask Thee to stay
Close by me forever and love me, I pray
Bless all the dear children in Thy tender care
And take us to heaven to live there

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His sweet head
The stars in the sky looked down where He lay
The little Lord Jesus, asleep on the hay

Sweet dreams, Baby Jesus
Our Lord and Savior
Oh, sweet dreams, Baby Jesus
Away in a manger

King of Kings
Lord of Lords
Prince of peace
My Lord and Savior, yes I love You

Jesus, Jesus
Away in a manger
Jesus, Jesus
Our Lord and Savior
Jesus, Jesus
Away in a manger
