I’ll follow you down, I’ll follow you down
I will follow you, I will follow you

Run towards the light you see
Run towards the light you see
Let it follow you, let it follow you
Let it follow you, let it follow you

Ring, I’m ringin' on your phone
You’ve been riding on the fast lane
A what they call "booty call", but you’d rather
"You’re living in the fast lane"
Ring, I’m ringin’ on your phone
You’ve been riding on the fast lane
A what they call "booty call", but you'd rather
"You're living in the fast lane"
I will follow you
I will follow you

Run towards the light you see
Run towards the light you see
Let if follow you, let it follow you
Let if follow you, let it follow you

Ring, I’m ringin' on your phone
You’ve been living in the fast lane
A what they call "booty call"?
You said no, you’re living in the fast lane
Ring, I’m ringin’ on your phone
You’ve been living in the fast lane
A what they call "booty call"?
You said no, you're living in the fast lane

Everyone's mother knows I'm just a girl
Everyone's mother

Imma come out, outside your house
Imma come out, outside your house
And you can't even find but you come out to the sound
Imma come out, outside your house
And you follow, you follow, you follow
And you wallow, you wallow, you wallow
Imma run out your cash
Imma run out your place
Imma run out, outside your house
