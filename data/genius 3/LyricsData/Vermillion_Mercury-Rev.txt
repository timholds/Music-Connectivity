An unseen force behind the turning leaves
Drives them all vermillion and green
You never gave up on me somehow
I don't know why I haven't turned by now

Ooh I know love sounds impossible
Some words are just so hard to say
And there's times you feel unlockable
An' all you ever want
Is someone to try...to open up...and find a way in

Don't ever say you were wrong for me
For you were always strong enough for three
I never let you in my world somehow
I'm asking you to please, allow me now

Ooh I know love sounds impossible
Some words are just so hard to say
And there's times you feel unlockable
An' all you ever want
Is someone to try...to open up...and find a way in

Truer skies beyond the swirling clouds
The other birds are off and flying south
We'll have to make our own way there somehow
An' I'm asking you to please trust me now

Ooh I know love sounds impossible
Some words just take so long to say
And there's times you feel unlockable
An' all you ever want
Is someone to try...to open up...and find a way in

Someone to try...want someone to try, want someone to try, want someone to try...
