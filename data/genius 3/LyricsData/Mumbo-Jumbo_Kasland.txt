[Hook: Cryptic Wisdom]
Everybody's got something on their mind
That they want to get accomplished all the time
But all I hear is talking, talking
You need to do a bit more walking, walking, mumbo jumbo

[Verse 1: Kasland]
Wake up Kas, it's time for you to hear this
Time to take a look at your very own dearest
Friend in the mirror trying to get you on your feet
While you're cooped up in your room doing nothing out of fearness
Hear this? It's the sound of the clock ticking
Time to let it out Kas I know you got a lot hidden
Others blowing up cause they're not giving up
On themselves damn it why can't you see that you're not living
Why am I afraid? I'm living a lie
Can't seem to live so I'm driven to die
You're too afraid to fail and I get that, but
What do you think is going to happen if you don't give it a try
Take a look around at all the things that you've won
Do you want to let that go? That means that you're done
You put your heart in every song, but it bleeds out of none
I hope that James shows up and he screams at you son
Now pick up your feet, walk like a man
Straighten out those shoulders you were taught how to stand
Your favorite rapper rode the ride that you're on right now
Difference is when it stopped he just hopped out and ran
But no not you you are stuck here in traffic
Your future walks by, but you can't seem to grab it
You try to leave your past, but you're just like a magnet
And keep on going back then you're slacking I've had it
Stop looking back man there ain't nothing there
Not your friends not your foes just the pain that you dare
To feel everyday and you still want to pray
That a change will be made, but your brain's out of air
Then you want to wonder why you never make it through admission
And get to be a Freshmen, won't make it there wishing
Can't seem to see that the point is what you're missing
Just this one time won't you shut up and listen

[Hook: Cryptic Wisdom]

[Verse 2: Kasland]
Remember years ago when you let your mind go
Then you came up with something that would finally find gold
You never did a thing that ship sailed through the seas
Then you realized what you did and you fell to your knees
You missed another shot now suck it up and stand
The problem here is that it was just another plan
That you never acted on just like everything else
That's why the only girl you loved went and fucked another man
Now you have yourself a chance, but you can't seem to focus
Your mind drifts off far away into the coldness
You can't fuck up again, but you already know this
You're wanting shit to change then stop being hopeless
Now hear me out
You're stuck on these pills, feeling weary now
Scared of all the voices that you're hearing in your head
Well now you're talking to yourself so you can fear me now
You haven't made it yet, you're dreaming dude
Stop being what you're not, she's leaving you
You're giving up after all that we've been through
Man I know that you can do it I believe in you
I got to scream at you just to get your attention
Even then you barely hear a thing that I mention
You're in your little world with your headphones blaring
That's the same kind of shit that kept your ass in detention
Every single year til you finally gave up
Said fuck an education started trying to save up
To acquire you a studio and begin to chase your dreams
But what was there to say man your mind was made up
Remember what you've learned don't forget that it's sacred
It's time to lose your fear and stop standing there shaking
You don't know who I am well I'm just going to say it
I'm the you of the future that never got to make it
