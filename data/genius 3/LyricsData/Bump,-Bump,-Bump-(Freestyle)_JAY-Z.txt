[Intro]
Yeah Guru
Let's have a little fun with this one
I got another one

[Verse 1]
Nigga your shit is trash
When I see you I'mma beat your ass
You better stop playing with me
I don't give a fuck about no magazine
Don't need radio to do my thing
You see me nigga: bling, bling, bling
Take it to the bridge

[Hook]
Your SoundScan going down
You better off selling them now
Out the trunk, trunk trunk
You better stop fucking around
You're gon' make me chase your coward ass down
With the pump, pump, pump

[Verse 2]
I came into this game
Wanting more paper than Puff
Now I realise Puff paper ain't enough
Last week Bleek puffed Puff paper up
Beans buy a Bentley every week
And I know y'all don't know but G4's ain't cheap
And B she got ride G3
Plus real estate in Miami is highway robbery
Wars cost, I need guns for my robberies
I'm buying tanks, if you're thinking it's just rap
Don't go too far on that verse
Get your whole chest collapsed
It's just the facts
God bless the cats that think I'm a liar
Pick up a paper nigga, read my priors
"Just retire!"
They screaming from the peanut gallery
Not til my salary's like the real Mike Lowry
I kill shit 'til I catch Will Smith
Then I'm running Speilberg down (yes)
Everything I say I do, you can feel my words now
Or read about 'em later, nigga
You don't even know me and you mad
How's it feel to be a hater?
Now I know exactly how it feels to be a Laker
I'm in power in a Maybach with the mitsu towers
With a keyless ignition, eating Chows
A Nobu nigga, merci beaucoup
I'm in France, I meant in Japan
What the fuck wrong with you?
Everybody wanna know my networth
Niggas wake up on my dick, eat some breakfast first
I'm a legend, I ain't even left this Earth
I'm considered one of the best cause I wreck shit the worst
I don't care about no vest when that Tec hit, it hurts
Spinning that Lexus in reverse
Make your next whip a hurse
Best to keep in the verse
If it leaks into the street, I won't sleep
I'mma creep, 'til I rest one of your peeps
And I promise on my Momma, I'm just trying to keep that peace
But I'm an outcast, nigga
So I gotta keep a piece
And cock you and shock it's a security breach
Don't let me reach point break
I hit you, Point Blank
This ain't a movie dog!

[Hook]

[Outro]
Black Album's on the way, I know you heard my footsteps
