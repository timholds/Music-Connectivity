[Hook: Big KRIT]
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready cuz, some days and sometimes, it's harder than it's ever been before
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready cuz, some days and sometimes, it's easier if I just let go

[Verse 1]
My partner hit me one time
Said he felt like killing himself
Ain't much that I could say to him
Except I understood how he felt
It's more to life than drug money
It's more to life than cars and clothes
But when you raised in the wild as a child with the lions and hunters that's all you know
We caught up in a whirlwind of bullshit
That's why it's hard to hear the pastor in the pulpit
That's why these youngsters down to rumble on the corner over numbers with the lumber and they ain't scared to pull it
I thought there was a calm after the storm
Its been category five since I was born
I'm losing friends everyday over strays
It's getting hard to mourn

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
My home girl hit me one time, she 'bout to sell her body for change
Ain't much that I can say to her, I guess that's just a part of the game
There's more to life than fly bags, there's more to life than diamonds and pearls
But when you raised without a father and your mother never bothered, it's hard to stay a little girl
She caught up in a whirlwind of stage lights
She'll do whatever that you ask her if the pays right
Get a lover with no rubber cuz he claimed that he was clean, now she know what having AIDS like
I thought there was a calm after the storm
It's been a category five since she was born
I'm losing friends everyday over pay
It's getting hard to mourn

[Hook]
