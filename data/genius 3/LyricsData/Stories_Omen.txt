Caught in the pain
Everything to lose, everything to gain
Caught in the pain
Everything to lose, everything to gain
So confused, no one to blame
Story of my life, life, life, life
Caught in the pain
Everything to lose, everything to gain
So confused, no one to blame
Story of my life, life, life, life

Stop comparing, but it's so hard
When it's all around me, and I still got no job
Best friend a doctor, other friend a lawyer
Other friend's famous, Oh my God
And they all younger, did they just have more hunger?
Is fate playing hide-and-seek, sometimes I wonder
Where the hell is that life? What's affecting my flight?
Where the hell is my wife? Or at least Mrs. Right
Or at least for the tonight, can I least take you home?
Cause I need to vent on something more than songs
I'm more than what's shown, more than what's known
This woe is me poetry flows in my bones
Recording alone at night, it seems my soul is on ice
I'm a man so I'm supposed to fight
Mr. Dreamer, hope you're right

[Hook]

Can't get respect from the bloggers, can't get respect from the labels
And my own city sleeping on me now, I'm really getting so unstable
Gotta step it up another notch, though I got my eyes on the clock
Never drank, but I swear right now, man I need a shot of the scotch
Need a little puff of the haze, just a little something to blaze
Hope won't work, so I need more for these uncomfortable days
Oh wait, now I'm on tour, and I think that might cure
Or at least sideline everything thus far I've endured
No more woe is me, these moments heaven sent
Chasing my dreams the longest I've ever ran
Tell me why I still feel pain, tell me the shit don't change
Tryna make it to the top, but I stay stuck on this cliff I hang
Thinking about click click bang, but I'll probably miss my aim
I done gave my whole life up, tell me, are you not entertained?
Can't even look up to the sky cause I got too much pride
Wanna know the story of my life? Just take a look in my eyes

[Hook]

Now whether I'm right, or I'm wrong
This is my life, it's gotta be known
Hope you know more with every song
So many stories, stories, stories
Now whether I'm right, or I'm wrong
This is my life, it's gotta be known
Hope you know more with every song
So many stories, stories, stories, stories
