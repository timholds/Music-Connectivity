Now I'm insane, but I must go when I go
What's anything, now I'm insane

Now I'm insane, but I must live when I live
What's anything, now I'm insane. It's sane!

To the bottom, follow me down
Carrying the body to my mind
It's nothing. Going down, going up. I'm free

Utaimashou afureru kurai itsumademo doko made mo

Give me something to believe
Burning body to my mind
It's burning. Going down, going up. I fly

Odorimashou chigireru kurai itsumademo doko made mo

I'm dancing in the hell
I'm singing in the rain

To the bottom, follow me down
Carrying the body to my mind
It's nothing. Going down, going up. I'm free

Utaimashou afureru kurai itsumademo doko made mo
Odorimashou chigireru kurai itsumademo doko made mo

I'm dancing in the hell
I'm singing in the rain

Now I'm insane... Now I'm...

Now I'm insane, but I must go when I go
What's anything...

Now I'm insane, but I must live when I...

Give me something to believe
Burning body to my mind
It's burning. Going down, going up. I fly

Utaimashou afureru kurai itsumademo doko made mo
Odorimashou chigireru kurai itsumademo doko made mo

Now I'm insane, (but) I must go when I go
What's anything.......

Now I'm sane
