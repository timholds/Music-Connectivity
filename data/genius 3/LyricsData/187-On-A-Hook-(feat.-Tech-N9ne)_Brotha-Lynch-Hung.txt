[Hook: C-Bo] 2x
(It's) 187 on a motherfuckin' hook
Niggas out of bounds should'a shook
We banging by the book
Got shot in the back tryna get away
And to a WG it ain't nothing but gun play

[Verse 1: C-Bo]
Buck these niggas, I'm a killer screamin' regime
Deep NAVI's with heat like the A-Team
And when my K scream, it's causin' nothin' but murder
Bucking these niggas making 'em hate me
Yeah, nigga, we don't give a fuck, nigga we thug lords
Connected with Tech N9ne and touched for the thug war
Who got love for these niggas with no love
At all give a fuck guns clutched, only left a ball
I know you heard of me ...wanna murder me
Cause I'm the nigga that cooked the bird (?) in the kitchen
Moms itchin' had the whole gang unwrappin' chickens
Nigga and we was headed for the jack strapped
With a fat gat, all my niggas down to rat-tat-tat-tat
West coast bad boys we was yellin'
Now it's West Coast Mafia regime and thug zellin' nigga

[Verse 3: Tech N9ne]
Nigga to catch this nigga, I'm ready to peel one
Instead of the shoulders I gotta diss toward a niggas grill some
Vigilante and villain regime niggas come with steel guns
Get ready to sleep cause you tripped when you fuck with a villain
Which one of y'all motherfuckers said "fuck Tech N9ne!"
Shady Pacino, turned C-ho when I clutched that N9ne!
Me and my nigga C-Bo Yuk Mezzole not only bust that rhyme!
We can do it illegal so the evil'll give a fuck next time!
Nigga don't you ever spit my name
And thinking that shit's the same
Two thou we switched the game and spit the flame
"Allahu Akbar!" is what I say before I buck y'all
Motherfuck busters like vell-Bacardi-yeah nigga had enough y'all
Get ready to suffer, kneel down, nigga-
Tech N9ne! Killer Klown, nigga
6 feet underground is where you're found, nigga
