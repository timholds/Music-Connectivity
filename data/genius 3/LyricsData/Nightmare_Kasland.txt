[Verse 1]
I’m like the Energizer bunny
I’m a lifelong lasting battery
I used to struggle to write these songs
But now this shit just comes so naturally
I don’t know when I’ll quit stop asking me
You fucks are getting so annoying
If you ask me one more time I swear to God
You will never hear the last of me
I’ll stuff your face ‘til you suffocate
Fuck the wait I’ll bust a grape
Now must I say I’m just insane
And if you don’t like it run away
My life’s a game, you want to play
Our fun can end another day
But you better catch up before I win
You’re losing kid I’m one away
I’m going to say what I’ve come to say
Now drop to your knees and learn to take it
Monster sleeping in my head
And I guess it wouldn’t hurt to wake it
False, it’ll only be worse to make it
Angry to the point that it rips you naked
I promised that I’d never blow
Now watch me take my word and break it

[Hook]
You can’t escape from this place so just stay right there
When you’re trying to fight these demons they don’t fight fair
I look right into the kiddy’s eye like hi there
Welcome to my asylum it’s a nightmare

[Verse 2]
Mr. K. Sleezy has feelings like me
But he was the first damn person to show it
I got the little guy living inside my head
What am I I said it’s a curse and I know it
But I need him by my side to give me the strength
And courage I need to verse my opponent
And pop out, smack him around for a bit
‘Til he’s screaming cause it hurts when I doughnut
“Wait, what about a doughnut?”
A doughnut
Doughnut?
Yeah, don’t you like donuts?
Nah
Have you ever had a Hurtz doughnut?
What the hell’s a Hurtz do… (Punch)
Hurts, don’t it!?” (Hahahahahaha!)
I’m here to stay for rounds to come
So you better pack a lunch marine
Cause boy I’m sick I’m the type to stick
My dick in a Pack-A-Punch machine
Girl I ain’t playing with you, what’s this look like
Call Of Duty, God you’re fruity
Look at you you’re all into me
Pull yourself together hottie oowee

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Speak to the devil then I sell my soul
Pedal to the metal then to hell I go
There’s a fairytale in everybody
Let me tell you the tale of a tale I know
This right here is the story of a man
Who just doesn’t know where the hell he’s been
Or where the hell he is, so tell me this
Can you try to put your mind where your belly is
Try having your thoughts shoved down your throat
All day long you can tell he’s pissed
You want my two cents on a record now
Here’s a penny for my thoughts try selling this
I give my thoughts to the mic and
It looks back at me Like what the hell is this
I’m a second away from pulling a gun
And putting more holes in me than a deli Swiss
Load it, cock it, aim don’t stop it
Point to my head say cheese and shoot
Men look at me like what the hell
Women look at me like he’s a hoot
What got me here is the one thing that I cease to do
But it’s pleasing you
Want me to tell you my biggest secret (yeah)
Well that’s too bad cause I’m teasing you

[Hook]
