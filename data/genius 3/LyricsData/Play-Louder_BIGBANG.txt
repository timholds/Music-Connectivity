Somewhere in Edendale
The late 2 thousands
Among motor roar
And shaky houses

She lies awake
Her heart beating faster
And needs to know
But there's no answer
To why

The whole world's coming down
And I'm not around
To help her
When the whole world's coming down
And I'm not around
All I can do is play
Lalalala louder
Lalalala louder

There's smoke in the city
A fire in the valley
Searching through the ashes
We tend to get irrational
Like nothing really happened
I find it hard to feel
I find it hard to make
The illness disappear

And now
The whole world's coming down
And I'm not around
To help her
When the whole world's coming down
And I'm not around
All we can do is play
Lalalala louder
Lalalala louder
When the whole world's coming down

If there's anything i could do

She lies awake
In the power museum
Where we belong
And now we're leaving

The whole world's coming down
And I'm not around
Her ears are ringing
And the whole world's coming down
And I'm not around
All i can do is sing
Lalalala louder
Lalalala louder
