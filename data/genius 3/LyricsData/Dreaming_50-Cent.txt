[Intro]
(Don't wake me, I'm dreaming)
It feels like a dream

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I'm dreaming big, real big, I got big dreams
I'll kill 'em this year, I got big schemes
It's bigger than coke, it's bigger than dope
My marijuana mentality went up in smoke
I go hard, so hard there ain't nothing harder
Poor or rich, my nigga, I hustle regardless
'Til I die and touch the sky
I'll be trying to get my piece of the pie
Shoot me or love me or hate me or leave me alone
The jealousy's growing cause I'm in the zone
The underground king, I'm on the throne
Cause niggas just ain't on the shit that I'm on
What I've been through shift my mental
It sounds like murder on the instrumental
I tend to spaz, I went through cash
So fast gotta get me some more

[Verse 2: Christopher Williams]
If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
I can't get over the fact that I'm with you
Now that I have you I don't know what to do
Girl, if I'm dreaming I'm dreaming 'bout you
About the things that I'd like to do

[Chorus]
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, don't wake me
Don't wake me, I'm dreaming
Girl, I'm dreaming 'bout you

[Verse 3: Christopher Williams]
If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
I've been waiting for such a long time
For you to say that you would be mine
Now that you're here here by my side
I can't control the way that I feel inside

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone

[Verse 4]
Don't wake me up cause Clean Cut's dreaming
In a deep sleep my mind keeps scheming
I heard she had a man, I said ''so what?''
She be looking skinny then honey get donut
And I wanna taste her, straight up chase her
We can do this now if not then maybe later
Front to back, in fact I keep her screaming
For you I'm fiending, girl, you got me dreaming

[Bridge]
If I'm dreaming about you let's make this dream come true
If I'm dreaming about you let's make this dream of love come true

[Chorus]

[Verse 5: Christopher Williams]
If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete
If I'm dreaming just leave me alone
Turn off the lights and unplug the phone
If I'm dreaming then just let me sleep
Don't wake me up 'till my dream is complete
This dream is just, just you and me
