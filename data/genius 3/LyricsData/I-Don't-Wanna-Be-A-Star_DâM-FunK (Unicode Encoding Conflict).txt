I don't wanna be a star
Cause what I've seen so far
I don't wanna be a star
All I wanna do is create that's all
I don't wanna be a star
No I don't
Just wanna get down with my music
Its all I can do and nothing else
I only want to get down yeah oh
I don't have no aspirations
(?)
No
I swear to God so casually
I don't wanna be a star
Yes its corny what I seen so far
I don't wanna be a star
All I wanna do is create that's all
I don't wanna be a star
I never had any light dreams of fame
Cause some of this music biz can wreck your brain
And yo I ain't got time for games
No way
I just came to do one thing
And that's to funk and to swing
Check it out
Believe me when I tell you
I don't wanna be a star
Cause its corny what I seen so far
I don't wanna be a star
No I don't
Cause it sucks what I've seen so far
I don't wanna be a star
No I don't
Believe me
When I tell you
That I don't want no parts of the bullshit
That these folks are into no
I don't wanna be a star
Cause its corny what I've seen so far
I don't wanna be a star
No I don't
All I wanna do is create that's all
I don't wanna be a star
Cause its corny what I've seen so far
I don't wanna be a star
No I don't
Cause it sucks what I've seen so far
I don't wanna be a star

I don't wanna be a star
I don't wanna be a star
No I don't
No I don't
No I don't wanna be no
Just wanna be me
All I wanna do is be me
That's all I wanna do year
No way
No way
No I don't
Its the truth
I don't wanna be a star

Keep it away from me
All the fake shit
Keep it away
Walk free
Being a star is corny
And I never wanna be one
Naw
I just wanna be this music
That's it, that's all
(?)
I mean it
I don't wanna be a star
Something else
Way deeper
I don't wanna be a star
