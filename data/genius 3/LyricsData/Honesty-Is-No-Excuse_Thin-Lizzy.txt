Up till now I used to pass my time
Drinking beer so slowly, sometimes wine
No God, air, water or sunshine
And honesty was my only excuse
I took your love and I used it

Up till now my youthful stage
Was a useless rage, a torn out page, a worn out gauge
A dirty shade, a big charade, a has been made
And honesty was my only excuse
I took your love and I used it

Up till now my love life
A few sweet kisses, a little missy, a fork and knife
A happy home, a hand to hold, a land to roam
And honesty was my only excuse
I used to take life by the hand and I abused it

Up till now I used to tap dance
Take a girl by the hand
Saying I need your, I need your romance
Oh, I had me some chances
And honesty was my only excuse
I used to take your love and I abused it

Up till now the path of life
Was fair enough
Enough was fair, all was right
But now I know, I see the light
And honesty was my only excuse
