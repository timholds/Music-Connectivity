[Intro: Talay Riley]
Never gonna quit it, better than you done it
I'mma did it, ready to roll, it's all love
I'm a wizard, on this fly shit
Call me Qudditch, I'm on the ball

[Verse 1: Kano]
Yo, man-ah ri-bad man, Jean-Claude the beat
Man-ah refund dem, yeah you already know that
Scene went dance for a minute, but the flows back
Gyal dem they love it real hard, don’t hold back
Break her in half, snap her back like them old hats
Furthermore snap her back like Kodak
Jheeze, don't wear the Gucci but I'm gettin dem G's
And no I ain't a killer but I'm killin MCs
Yeah I'm on that villain shit
And I know a nigga don’t sniff Charlie Sheen but I be on that winnin' shit
And when them fuckers try duplicate this flow
I'll rustle up a new suttum I'll be on my Simmons shit

[Hook: Talay Riley]
Never gonna quit it, better than you done it
I'mma did it, ready to roll, it's all love
I'm a wizard, on this fly shit
Call me Qudditch, I'm on the ball
And I'm a badman on dis ting, ya know
Badman on dis ting, ya know
B-B-Badman on dis ting, ya know
Oh oh, oh oh
B-Badman on dis ting, ya know
Badman on dis ting, ya know
B-B-B-Badman on dis ting, ya know
Oh oh, oh oh

[Verse 2: Bashy]
Really I'm truly my doosie, I said my life's like a movie
I've been all over the Atlas, don't even rest on the Sabbath
Hotels with carpets and cameras, romance, some drama and action
Even when I ain't on set I'm surrounded by actors
But I don't mess with them pussies, I guess that makes me a wanker
I don't mess with those dicks cos that would make me a faggot
Crazy sex with some chicks, exotic ting on my mattress
Talk my Santander account finances with my accountant
No deal, spunked 30 on the whip, cuzzy can you?
S-Tronic now, I'm too lazy for a manual
Red interior, lookin' at Ragu
Symbol on the steering wheel, lookin' at bangles
Paperboy and gyalis, no time to write about dudes
But if you think I said a line about you, it's about you
I don't fear any talk, I don't fear any court, bruv I'll Rafael Nadal you
In the club and we're scoopin up the dirt like a vacuum
Nigga dans Paris, merci beaucoup
Nuff flake here, no curries or shampoos
It's big steaks in here, yeah we're eating in Cairo
And you rappers who pay for views, tut tut tut, shame on yous
Haters, I ain't got no hate for you
See life from a position of money, call it pay per view

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wretch 32]
I promise that it's all L-O-V-E
Met her in the hood, still took her through the city
She didn't know a small plate of food would cost a pinky
Tryna give her faith, now she thinkin' that I'm Diddy
I'm just tryna show you what the other side's like
I don't wear suit, but I got ties
When I couldn't reach my ceiling that's when I saw the light
And even what I divide looks like it's multiplied
Times times times, I don't really spend it
Bet you weren't offended, when I was offendin'
Used to have a bounce, but now I get the checks in
Pussy bring your clit and I'mma fuck you at the entrance
My baby boy can probably buy a baby Range
My little girl rocking Fendi sipping SMA
I got spices of girls
I'mma turn 'em all posh, I’m just tryna live the Beckham way

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Scorcher]
Ever since Top Boy they call me Kamale
And I ain’t done no acting classes
It’s all love so I’m pouring shots in glasses
Getting numbers off a-every fly gyal that passes
Winner flow, bring the verse back
I’m killing this riddim so where's the hearse at
When I’m in the spot you know where the girls at
Tell a hater do me a favour, take your girl back
It’s all love so I’m getting feel-ups
I’m rubbing it in, gettin' my cream up
Dirty money but a nigga's tryna clean up
You ain’t big enough to get a feature, please bruv
Fans all over the globe, that’s what the tour does
Beehive, all you other brothers got a small buzz
So when niggas hate anything that Scorch does
Tell 'em I’m getting paid so it’s all love

[Hook]
