1 - Let me be the one you come running to
Be the one you come running
Be the one you come running to
Let me be the one you come running to
Be the one you come running
Be the one you come running to

Don't cry lady, dry your eyes
You know I want to be the one
To make you feel alright
If you will let me do what I wanna do
Then I will be the one
The one that you come running to

2 - Now wasn't I that special guy
That you could rely on
A shoulder to cry on
If you would give me the opportunity
I'll show you what I'll do
I'll be the one that you come running to

Repeat 1

When your troubles seem to get you down
Before you can even call me
You know I'm gonna be around
Pick up the pieces of your broken heart
I'll fix it for you, because I'm the one that you come running to

Repeat 2

Repeat 1

Repeat 1

Now wasn't I your special guy
That you could rely on
Your shoulder to cry on
If you just give me the opportunity
I'll show you what I'll do
When you come running, running, running to me
When you come running to me

Repeat 1 until fade
