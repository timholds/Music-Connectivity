[Intro: Travis Scott]
I'm, I'm off the molly right now

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
5 mo', 5 in a row
They at ya door from Lamron down to the mo'
Can't get out of my head, can't keep takin' these meds
5 in a row, I want some mo'
5 mo', 5 in a row
They at ya door from Lamron down down to the mo'
Can't get out of my head, can't keep takin' these meds
Like 5 mo', 5 in a row

[Bridge: Travi$ Scott & Lil Durk]
Na, na na na
And I'm killin' all my enemies
Na, na na na
And I'm killin' all my enemies

[Verse 1: French Montana]
On my nose a bandanna, on my neck is a Phantom
All my hoes from Atlanta, all my dogs in the slammer
Talk to Death Row, talk to Tony Montana
Bitch talk on the low, screamin' Frenchie Montana
Time to fill up your head, Henny, fuck that MoÃ«t
Fall asleep in the east, wake me up on the west
Shawty calling me dada, aw no mommy no, no
Throwing up in the Audi after fistin' and menage

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
5 mo', 5 in a row
They at ya door from Lamron down to the mo'
Can't get out of my head, can't keep takin' these meds
5 in a row, I want some mo'
5 mo', 5 in a row
They at ya door from Lamron down down to the mo'
Can't get out of my head, can't keep takin' these meds
Like 5 mo', 5 in a row

[Verse 2: Lil Durk]
Straight up, in that jeep, can't wait up
He ain't say who he say he is, he an actor, he play tough
I just copped me a Rollie, okay I lied, cuz I took it
Do a show in a valley, I tell 'em boys to go book
Fresh out my city, I'm shootin', land in my city, I'm coolin'
Bunch of niggas smokin' Tooka, ride with guns in a Uber
I get caught, I can't go, my lawyer fresh from Jerusalem
Audi R8 logo look like 4 kids hoola hoopin'

[Hook: Travi$ Scott]
5 mo', 5 in a row
They at ya door from Lamron down to the mo'
Can't get out of my head, can't keep takin' these meds
5 in a row, I want some mo'
5 mo', 5 in a row
They at ya door from Lamron down down to the mo'
Can't get out of my head, can't keep takin' these meds
Like 5 mo', 5 in a row
