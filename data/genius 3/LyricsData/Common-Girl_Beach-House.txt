[Verse 1]
You used to live in this part of town
Until you hit the ground
She makes movies where she cries on cue
She still lives downtown

[Chorus]
But it's ok
Cause she's common anyway
And the streets are all filled
With the strangers, pay the bills

[Verse 2]
She's the one with the lazy eye
Promises never come filled
Takes the pills and hides the notices
Cartoon rings of ill will

[Chorus]
But it's ok
Cause she's common in every way
And the streets are all filled
With the strangers, pay the bills

[Verse 3]
Nobody special done a good thing
For somebody else
Taking advantage of that good thing
For nobody else
(Oooooh)
(Oooooh)
(Oooooh)
(Oooooh)
