And then you'll rain down upon all of their blasphemies

Creeping catastrophes always awaiting you

Raise up a mountain of myth disproportionate

False and inordinate

Lead them astray

The torrent around you of terrible thunderclouds

Ceased to protect you from rioting ruffians

Launching you far from the worlds that you'd wrought

To the loosening knot at the centre of everything

There you brought light and a wind to blow suns around

All up and down you the deepening fixtures

And people with posture, and you in their poetry

Gory and gruesome in stories and fiction

And then you'll rain down upon all of their blasphemies

Creeping catastrophes always awaiting you

Baiting and blathering, all that you've gathered

Will crumble together around you again
