[Chorus]
Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We got to love thing
We're talking about

[Verse 1]
The way you looked at me
Tells me you're sorry
You walked by me
Whispering you love me
When I tried to hold you tight
You pulled away
But you wanted me to stay
Instead you ran away
Baby, talk to me let's stop playing games
Don't turn away from me
Just look me straight in the eyes
Don't try to sweet talk me
With those nasty words you say
Baby, just be real and tell me how you feel

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
The way you tricked me
You know that wasn't right, ooh
You tried to hit me
There's no need to fight
Because I gave you everything
I had to give
If you know it's worth the fight
We got to compromise
Baby, talk to me
And tell me what's wrong
Come sit down next to me
And let me feel the vibe you on
Because everything will be alright
But we must communicate
Tomorrow it could be too late

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Because I love you boy
And I need you here
Together we can make this thing work out
To think about
What we could miss
It makes me want to lose my mind

[Chorus]
