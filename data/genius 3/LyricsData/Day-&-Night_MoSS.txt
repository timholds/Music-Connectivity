[Verse 1]
Hey yow Hey yow
I pray to God heaven chanel depends
Says what need to be said
Speak my truth and seek the truth that was said
I pray the sun don't set on my sins
Oh heaven I wait with good intentions but i messed up again
I swear the days are getting shorter and the nights extended for longer
It's like an after I was brought a brighter I never knew closure
I never knew all the addictions would just grow and get stronger
Like supervillains I got them in me I got to get over them
The truth is I kinda like they excite me they broke and just like that
I am to be the likely can kick it we get to
We get to know the ways that we like
Like a bartender that Knows your favorite drink
And they serving you what for free until you stumble
And you say that you know good
Things that will get you in trouble
Get you hang over to the point the sun is rising
And you running for cover duck
A vampire aspiration for a sucker blood
That he shed for us we all can’t retain his lust
Lust lust I lust on sight lust me right
Still I got a lust for the night don’t let it set
Our father who warth in heaven
Hallowed be your name your kingdom come
It will be done on Earth as it is in heaven
Give us our day our daily breath
And forgive us of our traspasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation

[Verse 2]
And when the sun decides to set I can feel my heart
Fought a battle in my chest the choice is simple pass or fail
I guess I’m failing the test It’s all lust and all of us has a choice
To live a life or throw it all away to quiet the noise
The flesh screaming I got demons that I cannot avoid
And to ignore these trees in a part of me
Just like my arms and feet is like diaries
And I got pain that I’m feeling  I got a hole that is bleeding
It needs a plug it needs a version that is evening
Pray that I’m breathing
When the sun rise in the morning comes time
I look up and I start for a sign
But last night when I was creeping body
Waking so asleep and morning is death
Watch the last breath leaving
Even in the sky I start asking why
It's all obvious the truth in all of us
Yet we living a lie don’t let it set
