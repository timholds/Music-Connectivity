[Verse 1: Kasland]
When I was real young, still in Kindergarten
There was another kid everybody picking on him
He would curl up in a corner as the kids were ripping on him
Called him names, he had no friends, but I could never see the problem
Man what was it that this kid did to deserve to be mistreated
I could never understand why all the teachers couldn't see it
Then they threw rocks at this boy while he just cried til he was bleeding
So I stepped up told them beat it I was heated man I mean it
I never could believe it how could these kids be so cruel
He was bullied to a point that he would almost leave the school
Til he finally found a friend when I reached down to help him up
Introduced myself and got to know this kid like hey what's up
You see I had a voice and used it just to make these bullies go
I asked why they would hurt him, he said he didn't know
I never saw a difference between us so I asked
The bullies why they did it, turns out cause he was black

This is the way that things are and
This is the way we resolve them
We are the ones who make choices
To open up our eyes and utilize our voices

[Verse 2: Kasland]
Are we really so quick to just forget just who we are
Or is it that we focus on today and not tomorrow
I look up in the sky and then I wish upon a star
I throw my voice across the world and simply hope that it goes far
Maybe one day we won't be filled with so much hate
That we can all just get along and gays can walk among the straight
I know I talk a lot, but hey I'm just a kid with an opinion
If I keep it to myself I guess the world can keep on sinning
Nah, we let our fear just overcome us
We should take a stand together because power comes in numbers
By the ones, by the tens, then eventually the hundreds
Separate us from the fear and let the hatred come to love us
Time to be some better people, use your voice to set you free
I'm trying to paint a picture perfect so that I can help you see
All the problems in this world so you can paint it for someone
Who's in need to see the truth what you waiting for? Come on

[Hook: Monica Humbles]

[Bridge: Kasland]
We as human beings seem to overlook the screams
Seem to overlook the things that connect us to our dreams
And if really all it means to be united in the gleams
Of this nation is to fear then say what hope it really brings
