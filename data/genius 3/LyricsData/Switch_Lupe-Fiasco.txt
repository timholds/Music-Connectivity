[Intro: Lupe talking]
Yeah, revenge, now what we gonna do right now, a ha ugh, is gonna try a little experiment, just a little experiment, you know what I'm saying, a little science project, you know what I'm saying, I like to call it

[Verse 1]
Switch
You you you, yes let the words woo you
Till you woozy
Let the lyrics subdue you
Massage and soothe you
Move you till conscience lose you
Lu now rules you
You do what Lu do and you'll do beautiful
Switch
I'm the meanest
You the meanest?
I'm the meanest
And I mean this
Now I don't mean this
To sound fiendish
But I'm a genius
You a genius?
And the cleanest
Never seen this
As clean as
My cleanest
From on top
From underneath
From behind
Or in between
Switch
I'm a hustler creeping with my hat low
Niggas know I pack so
What they gonna do that for?
Niggas got my back though
Like answering the back door
Catch you I'm a slap you, leave you redder than the bat phone
Switch
With a little bit of this and a little bit of that
That
Mixed with a little bit of pimp
And a little bit of mac
And a little bit of limp
And a whole lotta gangster lean
I can't be seen
I ain't the King, but a nigga is strengthening
To paint the scene
And take the thing over
Like a soldier, colder than a polar, Got the hood like a cobra, nigga thank the team

Switch!

[Hook]
Switch nigga, this is how I got it
I switch like hydraulic cars
Switch like DeBarge, nigga. (Switch)

(Aight, now remember that, that's a, that was a part of the experiment
I had to set it up so. So don't worry I know what your thinking, I was thinking the same thing
Just, just follow me ok. Watch, ok. Come on now)

[Verse 2]
Murder niggas
Step on my shoes I hurt a nigga
Kill a nigga
Fill a nigga with holes
Call women hoes
Hold up niggas, hold up hoes
Break the calm, detonate bombs
Blow up niggas, blow up hoes
Turn around, smack they moms
Switch
Heal niggas
Educate and build niggas
Instill in niggas itâ€™s real to respect women
Treat'em like they real
They feel, nigga
Watch the birds
Watch Dr. Phil, nigga
Chill, nigga
Go learn a skill, nigga
Aight
Switch
Rims, Mercedes Benz, twenties, twenty-twos, twenty-fours, rose gold, platinum watches, cases of Mo'
Gucci, rubies, mansions, models, VIP, Ferraris, chinchillas, diamond rings, change, Range Rovers, bling bling
Switch
Niggas bust his trains
Pocket full of change
Dimes, quarters, taking orders
Delivering pizzas
Air conditionless, beaters
Hand-me-down sneakers
Silver
Wannabe models won't show me love
And I can't get in the club
Switch

[Hook]
(Ha, it getting good right? Yeah, aight, so check this out
Now go back to the first one, aight, run back to that one
We're going to have a little bit more fun with that one, aight
You ready? Aight. Come on)

[Verse 3]
Switch
Hey hey hey, it's coming back to you
Lu no longer rules you
You can do what you do
Back to your usual
Switch
It's official
It's official
I'm official
As officials
Who got the stripes
And the flags
And the whistles
Switch
Whistle and watch my niggas come
From the underground
Just like Thriller play Bambi
And you gonna hear that thumper sound
Switch
They can't touch the sound
That I'm busting now
It's like a cloud trying to touch the ground
Tough and bound, ever since we're touching down
Jealous niggas catch your feelings cuz I'm hustling now
What?
Switch
They be hating
Switch
They be hating
Switch
What? What? What?
They be hating
Don't give them stage
Switch
What's a nigga supposed to tell them when they up in my face then?
Switch
That you got a cousin that don't mind catching cases
Busting niggas' heads in, slapping niggas' faces
Switch
And he a do it
He a do it
He a do it
And I'll prove it
Cuz I didn't seen it
You didn't seen it?
I'd a seen it
He the meanest
Switch
Ho, ho, ho. Wait
I mean it
I thought you were the meanest
See?
That's why this thing is fiendish
Right, now
Switch

[Hook]

[Outro: Lupe talking]
Yeah, experiment done. I think that was a goody, I think that was a good experiment, I think that was nice. It's a nice little science project
Haha! Revenge! Shoutouts to my homies at asylum. What up? Yeah
