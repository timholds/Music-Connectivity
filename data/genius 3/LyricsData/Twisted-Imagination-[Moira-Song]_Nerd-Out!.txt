[Verse 1]
I've been working in shadows way too long
Gave me all of the blame, when things went wrong
Found my place right here, where I belong, I belong
I've been known to take risks, that the others won't
No I never had the caution others show
Cause there's so much in the world nobody knows, nobody knows

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause they've been trying to keep me silent
But tell me how this feels (let's go)

[Chorus]
My twisted imagination—nation
Yeah
It's more than you'd understand
This mind knows no limitation—tation
Yeah
Got nothing holding me back

[Verse 2]
The Overwatch went and betrayed my trust
When I needed a home, Talon opened up
My experiments show, that there's more to us, more to us
The usual rules just aren't for me
I created some things that you won't believe
There's a new world coming, just wait and see, wait and see

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause they've been trying to keep me silent
But tell me how this feels (let's go)

[Chorus]
My twisted imagination—nation
Yeah
It's more than you'd understand
This mind knows no limitation—tation
Yeah
Got nothing holding me back
(Got nothing holding me back)
My twisted imagination—nation
Yeah
It's more than you'd understand
(It's more than you'd understand)
This mind knows no limitation—tation
Yeah
Got nothing holding me back

[Bridge]
Innovation's my thrill
Can bring you life or can kill (ha-ha-a-a)
Don't fear my ambition, respect my position
Surrender to my will

[Chorus]
(Got nothing holding me back)
My twisted imagination—nation
Yeah
It's more than you'd understand
(More than you'd understand)
This mind knows no limitation—tation
Yeah
Got nothing holding me back
