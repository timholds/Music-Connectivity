[verse 1]
Hey there Tyler
You've got such a pretty face
Seen you hanging at Harry's Place
Lazing in the sun
Ignoring everyone

[verse 2]
Hey there Tyler
I thought I'd seen it all before
You poke your nose around the door
And run across the floor
Ignoring everyone

[Chorus]
You're always fighting with your brother
But it'll be over soon
When you sleep in the afternoon

[verse 3]
Hey there Tyler
No need to be afraid of me
Come and lie across my knee
Stretch your feline form
For here it's safe and warm

[Chorus]
You're always fighting with your brother
But it'll be over soon
When you sleep in the afternoon
