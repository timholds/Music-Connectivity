[Verse 1]
Yeah, we back with that crack shit
Motherfuckers die for, just spittin' facts bitch
Reusing old lyrics not for ya'll attention
The polar opposite, ya'll probably just missed em
So fuck, man I started up this mission
A white heroin fiend with an ego and ambition
Pushed on strong, said "fuck the opposition"
And worked to become more than a juxtaposition

[Hook X2]
Add it up arithmetic, addict up not gettin' sick
That's the trick, man don't call it magic
That's the shit, that keep me in demand like bricks
And if you ain't coppin son, suck a fat dick

[Verse 2]
Spittin' classic even though I'm not raspy
Fuckin crafty man, the way I spit nasty
I'm bumpin' Blastic, feeling 'fan-fuckin-tastic'
Paranoid as fuck, so I act a bit drastic
Advisory parental, intercontinental
I say fuck a lot, but I still kick it mental
-ly ill, fuck stackin' dollar bills
Just tryin' to cop quick to keep away the chills

[Hook X2]

[Verse 3]
One line, ya'll choose who can spit the sickest
Like ya mom spittin' hard after she done sucked my dick bitch
I kick it real slick, if the truth be told
Don't give a fuck if that bitch be old
Here's a tip, if this music worries you
Then you a deaf little bitch that fact is true
Where, who, what the fuck was I talking bout
Oh yeah, pissin' on the fire that was the fuckin' doubts

[Hook X2]
