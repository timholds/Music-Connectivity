*rain and thunder*

[Hook x2: Sauldin]
Now I lay me down to sleep
I, I pray the Lord that my soul he keeps
If I should die, before I awake
I, I pray the Lord that my soul he takes

[Killah Priest]
If I die, may the sky turn forever grey
Neglect the moon of a light, turn the sun beige
May the Lord open up every grave
Every prophet that was slayed
May they roam the earth for thousands days
Give 'em a body of a slave
May the Lord strike this earth with pestilence and plagues
If I ever lay, may they cover me with weed, ash, hip and sage
Merry thug raid, may they bust in gauge
Merry judge pray, when they lower my cage
And my flesh return to wet clay
From which I was made, my bones rot and decay
If I rest eternal, may the Lords send great inferno
Till this day I write my journal
Journal, urban journal
(Lord)

[Hook]

[Killah Priest]
Dear heavenly Father
The reason why I stand at your gates holdin two revolvers
Cuz down on earth I had mad drama
Protect my body from the tabernacle of robbers
I pray that an angel take my body
Before the doctors have a chance to do an autopsy
Buryin me near Bob Marley, or even Haley Salassie
Surround me by his Israeli posse
What I know shocks me, the seven heads of Juliani
Six-six-six, illuminati, and Lord makes shorty mummify me
I put every word in my diary
So in time, every eye can see
Send death to the world, that's haunted
Kill 'em with torment, let the beast rise, that lies dormant
No more life insurance or police warrants, for me

[Hook x1.5]

[Killah Priest]
When I was born gynecologists surrounded my womb
Now I'm gone archaeologists surrounding my tomb
They suit me up in perfume, in that small church room
Don't cry, I be back to earth soon
Felt the fever of thieves in my blood
Born to live after the sunset of the world
If we die of another man's ignorance
Remember Lord, they ain't innocent
Before they acted nigga-ish, tasted hell bitterness
Swallow my tongue, like a liquorice
Though, runnin through his naked wilderness
Mad as a jackal, with the dry mouth
That prowls the grave at the time of drought
Bury me near King David
Somewhere in the oasis
Fill my body with Godly fragrance
May I sleep with the ancient
Feed my flesh to the ravens
Wish death on every peagan
If I finish my night in some gutter with my throat cut
By some fake friends who had me doped up
Fill this whole planet with smoke and such
If I'm murdered like Abrah'
May I fall in the arms of an angel
Fuck a close friend, they can change too
Return to the earth as Gairule, hostin my own funeral
Lookin unusual, may the earth choke and spit up my coffin
Use my body as an offering, God bless my offsprings
(Show him the way)
If I die tonight
(Show him the way)
