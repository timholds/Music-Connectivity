Baby what I feel for you
It's more than pain
It's more than hurt
I need you

Mommy I know
I'm nothing without you
I cherish your love
Girl you complete me

Oh I love it when your near
I miss you when your gone
And when we're all alone
We get it on

I love the memories
You know you're all I need
I'm begging baby please
Don't leave

You can have the clothes
The jewels
The stereo
The car is yours if you want to go

Just leave your love
Just leave your love
I need your love
You can have the house

The pool
The diamond rings
The stocks are yours
Girl take everything

Just leave your love
Oh no just leave your love

Baby don't go
I'm so lost without you
And I'm just gonna find
Life has no meaning

I need you in the night
I need you in the day
What do I have to say

To make you stay
I'll cross a thousand seas
I'll get down on my knees
I'm begging baby please

You can have the clothes
The jewels
The stereo
The car is yours if you want to go

Just leave your love
You can have the house
The pool
The diamond rings

The stocks are yours
Girl take everything
And just leave your love
Oh no just leave your love

I don't have anything
I don't have anything
I don't have anything
I don't have anything baby

You can have the clothes
The jewels
The stereo
The car is yours if you want to go

Just leave your love
Just leave your love
You can have the house
The pool

The diamond rings
The stocks are yours
Girl take everything
Just leave your love
Oh no just leave your love

You can have the clothes
The jewels
The stereo
The car is yours if you want to go

Just leave your love
You can have the house
The pool
The diamond rings

The stocks are yours
Girl take everything
Just leave your love
