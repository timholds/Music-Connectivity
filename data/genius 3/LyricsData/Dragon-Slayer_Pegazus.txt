Wielding a sword forged in fire and brimstone
Wearing an armor and shield of steel
Possessed the heart of a giant
A mortal man stands alone and stands fall

With no magic or powers to aid him
Only with courage and strenght he'll prevail
Sworn to serve this kingdom and country
Eternally, protector of the realm

Dragon slayer, with courage he'll fight
Dragon slayer, in the still of the night
Dragon slayer, on it's flesh he will feast
Dragon slayer, killer of the mythical beast

A morning of mist, his eagle has landed
It's tallons dripping the blood of their prey
The dragon charges bleeding and blinded
The slayer moves on into the affray

With no magic or powers to aid him
Only with courage and strenght he'll prevail
Sworn to serve this kingdom and country
Eternally, protector of the realm

Dragon slayer, with courage he'll fight
Dragon slayer, in the still of the night
Dragon slayer, on it's flesh he will feast
Dragon slayer, killer of the mythical beast

A flash of the blade, it's mortally wounded
The dragon stumbles and falls to the ground
He trusts his sword into the heart of creature
Mounts his horse and rides silently away

With no magic or powers to aid him
Only with courage and strenght he'll prevail
Sworn to serve this kingdom and country
Eternally, protector of the realm

Dragon slayer, with courage he'll fight
Dragon slayer, in the still of the night
Dragon slayer, on it's flesh he will feast
Dragon slayer, killer of the mythical beast
