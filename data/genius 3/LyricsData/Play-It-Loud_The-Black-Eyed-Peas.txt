[Intro]
I pledge, my allegiance
To rhythm, and sound
Music is my medicine
Let the rhythm pound

[Hook]
And play it loud, baby play it loud
Play it loud, baby play it loud
Rock the crowd, baby rock the crowd
And play it loud, baby play it loud

[Verse 1]
I found a love, it's in the music
Drop all your guns, drop all that bullshit
We found the love, inside the instruments
John Lennon, Bob Marley are my presidents
The sound of trumpets wake up people sleepin now
The drummer boy is drumming beats to shake the ground
The violins will pick you up when you are down
The melody will spin around and round and round

[Hook]
And who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from rockin with this sound?
Oh who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from break-b-b-breakin it down?

Gonna play it loud, gonna play it loud
Play it loud, baby play it loud
And rock the crowd, baby rock the crowd
And rock the crowd, baby play it loud

[Verse 2]
Hot beats coming from the city streets
MP3's via internet from overseas
DJ's play 'em, you, dance to 'em, swayin stayin up
All night, zombie life, audio delight, ohh
The sound of trumpets wake up people laying down, oh
The drum and volume playing gonna shake the ground, oh
The violins will pick you up when you are down, oh
The melody will spin around and round and round

[Hook]
And who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from rockin with this sound?
Oh who's gonna stop us?
Who's gonna stop us from break-b-b-breakin it down?

Gonna play it loud, gonna play it loud
Play it loud, baby play it loud
And rock the crowd, baby rock the crowd
Play it loud, baby play it loud

[Outro]
I pledge, my allegiance
To rhythm, and sound

This is wisdom...
A wise man once said
Tomorrow does not equal yesterday
