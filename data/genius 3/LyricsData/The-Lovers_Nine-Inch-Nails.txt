[Part one]

(I can hear you breathing)
I’ve slipped out of time again
Leaving all of you behind
And I’m free
To return to the place where I already am
And have always been
If i just really looked and allowed myself
To see
The confusion is seducing me warm perfect flowing
Wide his eyes
Summer
Hypnotize they see inside of me
Hot swollen skin want me take me perfect embrace
Black and bloody
Rotten and perfect
The center has moved on and all that’s left is free
Finally
Finally
Everyone seems to be asleep but me
Take me
Into the arms of the lovers
Free
Take me
Into the arms of the lovers


[Part two]

Oh i see you floating there
How could i ever hope to forget
Always rearranging, this is
These words are a lie a mirror reflecting in a mirror of a lie
A light shines still always
Shadows in every word
Beneath black eaves
Please don’t leave me here
I could stop it
Maybe i could stop it (if i wanted to)
But i’m not the one driving anymore
I know who i am
But i know who i am
Right?
(Please don't leave me here with them)
Take me
Into the arms of the lovers
Free me
Into the arms of the lovers
Into the arms of the lovers
Please
Into the arms of the lovers
I am free
Into the arms of the lovers
