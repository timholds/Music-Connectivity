I got your love on me baby , leavin' me was yesterday
Oh, I got to be the one ,you won't ever see me running away
Ah , when the day is done and I think of you
I get a feeling I just can't control
Ah, falling in love with you baby 
When I really should be sayin goodbye
And the glow of you livin' inside me
Got me knowin' we can never die
Fallin' in love with you baby
Is like a dream without an end
Shine all your love on me baby
Lead me to your ecstasy
In the heat of the night you can play with me baby
Take me where you want me to be
Ah , when the night is done and I think of you
I get a feeling way down in my soul , ah
Fallin' in love with you baby 
When I really should be sayin' goodbye
And the glow of you livin' inside me
Got me knowin' we can never die
Fallin' in love with you baby
Is like a dream without an end
How can we go wrong on a night like this
When we lie in the heart of your tenderness
Oh don't let go my darlin' 'cause I'm
Fallin' in love with you baby
When I really should be sayin' goodbye
And the glow of you livin' inside me
Got me knowin' we can never die
Fallin' in love with you baby
Is like a dream without an end
Fallin' in love with you baby
When I really should be sayin' goodbye
And the glow of you livin' inside me
Got me knowin' we can never die
Fallin' in love with you baby ...
