The king is in the mirror
The king is in the mirror
Mirror of the king
The king is in the mirror
King Zadek is in the mirror
Mirror of the kings

The king has a contender
A sorcerer reflector
Mirror of the kings
The king has a contender
A miracle reflector
Mirror of the kings

When studied one becomes
The steady one becomes
Oh la oh la oh la la
When studied one becomes
The one who's number is one and one and
One and one and one and one and one and one

You can't catch the king
Can't catch the king
You can't catch the king
Can't catch the king
You can't catch the king
