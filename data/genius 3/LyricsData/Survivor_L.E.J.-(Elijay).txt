Now that you're out of my life
I'm so much better
You thought that I'd be weak without you
But I'm stronger
Thought that I'd be broke without you
But I'm richer
Thought that I'd be sad without you
I laugh harder...

Thought I wouldn't grow without you
Now I'm wiser
Thought that I'd be helpless without you
But I'm stronger
Thought that I'd be stressed without you
But I'm chillin'
Thought I wouldn't sell without you
Sold nine millions...

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'...

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin' !

Thought I couldn't breathe without you
I'm inhaling !
Thought I couldn't see without you
Perfect vision
Thought I couldn't last without you
But I'm lastin'
Thought that I would die without you !
But I'm livin'...

Thought that I would fail without you
But I'm on top !
Thought it would be over by now
But it won't stop !
Thought that I would self destruct
But I'm still here !
Even in my years to come !
I'm still gon be here !

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'...

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'...

After all the darkness and sadness !
Soon comes hapiness...
(Ooh...) If I surround myself with positive things...
(Wooh-Ooh-Ooh !)

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'...

I'm a survivor
I'm not gon give up
I'm not gon stop
I'm gon work harder
I'm a survivor
I'm gonna make it
I will survive
Keep on survivin'...
