(Blackstar;Walker)
Yeah little rock and roller
Tell me how does this feel
Things are never what what they seem
And nothing is ever real
Yeah little rock and roller
I am telling you things never last
One foot in the present
Just a draught from the past
Little rock and roller yeah
All aboard come enjoy the ride
As the rock and roll circus comes around one more time
Hey little rock and roller
There is some good times up for grabs
It is such a pity
Your are stuck in anothers past
Hey little rock and roll
Play another number
Go bargain your soul
Living out the lie
Acting out this rotten roll
