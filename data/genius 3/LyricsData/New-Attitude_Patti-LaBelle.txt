[Verse 1:]
Runnin' hot
Runnin' cold
I was runnin' into overload
It was extreme

I took it so high, so low
So low
There was nowhere to go
Like a bad dream

[Hook:]
Somehow the wires uncrossed
My tables were turned
Never knew I had such a lesson to learn

[Chorus:]
I'm feelin' good from
My head to my shoes
Know where I'm goin'
And I know what to do

I tidied it up
My point of view
I got a new attitude

I'm in control
My worries are few
'Cause I've got love
Like I never knew
Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo
I got a new attitude

[Verse 2:]
I'm wearing a new dress, new hair
Brand new ideas
As a matter of fact
I've changed for good

It must have been the cool night
New moon, slight change
More than to figure, oh
But I feel like I should, yes

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Repeat Hook:]

[Repeat Chorus:]

Feelin', feelin'
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
From my head to my shoes
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)

I'm loving you
(I got a new attitude)
I got a new, new attitude
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)

Everything about me has changed
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
Baby, I ain't the same
(I got a new attitude)

Oh, I got a new
I got a new
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
I got a brand new
Brand new
(Ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo, ooo)
I got a new
