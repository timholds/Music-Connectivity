I watch you spin, from afar
I drink you in, and breath you out (x2)

I know that I’m the type of guy to goof up
But I can make you laugh when I do it
And do ya, you’ll hate me if I kiss a girl beside you
I’ma do say, your face will get wet like a scuba
You can use a tissue, I know that me and you have had our issues
But why? Cause technically I’m not really with you
I know we are together, more often than with others
You know how I feel about relationships, fuck em
Instead of complicating, how bout we do nothing
But continue sucking face and matchin' on that marijuana
And think nothing of it
Take drugs, because as long as I’m a younging
I’ma hate love, fuck love, I’d rather be, under the influence
Of substances instead of falling under the influences
Of some trick, who only takes from me
Leaving me with nothingness
The master plan, just fuck a bitch, shit

I watch you spin, from afar
(Breathe me in, breathe me out
It’s all it was, forget about it)
I drink you in, and breathe you out

Tryina dip fall left with a chip on my shoulder
But a shoulder that bitch give it’s colder
But you are not a bitch, you’re simply just the shit
Chilling with me on my roof, I’ll be smoking last spliff
Sharing on my piss
...tell is what I do to you
The fact that she listens is telling me what I mean with you
Be good together and I kinda wanna be with you
It’s tough catching feelings I hope you the type to keep it cool
Instead of fronting and arguing for the hell of it
Them other girls that always be fronting upon that jealous shit
That’s why I dig you, and I don’t wanna complicate
As I sit and contemplate, I feel we’ll always just remain
Homies, cause I’m still tryina learn from my mistakes
Can’t afford to fall deep and get stuck inside that place
Reluctant to let you in, cause you occupy my mind
Happens all the time, but if you just share, we’ll be fine, a’ight

I watch you spin, from afar
(Breathe me in, breathe me out
It’s all it was, forget about it)
I drink you in, and breathe you out

Exhale, when we kiss, shotguns, remember this
Smoke a bit until your memories are fresher
And then inhale the vapors, so we can quit the stressin
Things get messy, I skip the complications
I’m bout it if you bout it
Don’t need a confirmation
And all the aggravation, and what I gotta prove
If I wasn’t really bout it, would I still be here with you
I’m not some other dude, put that on my mother
Capricorn, shoot girl I’d rather be together
And you were such a scorpio the type to get emotional
You told me that you wanted more
I thought you were delusional, probably just compatible
I’m vibing out your energy
Let it all intensify as soon as you get next to me
And the sex ain’t the same as it used to be
It’s fucked up how some feelings change everything

I watch you spin, from afar
(Breathe me in, breathe me out
It’s all it was, forget about it)
I drink you in, and breathe you out
