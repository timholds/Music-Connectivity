[Verse 1]
Won't you come around Ma
Won't you come around on a rainy day?
I've been thinkin' about ya
I've been on the down trying to make my way
And I don't wanna doubt ya
I don't wanna doubt but it's safe to say
You don't come around no
Say you down to come sail soon
Through all the love and all the nonsense
Keep me caught up like the real life's up in my conscious
When they all be alone again without this
Ball and chain keep my feet on the brake for the boundless
Believe, believe, believe, believe
That's all we need for a minute
You find inner peace
But then it's slipping then it seems like you ain't never perfect Let it breathe
Finding my purpose acrylic paint on my sleeves
And loving with no receipt

[Hook]
And I'm a Trench Town killer going west
Young Dylan, feeling blessed I'm tripping all day
I got caught up trying to flex around women
Say we next, God willing
Hold your breath what's the problem you lose waist
But hey won't you come around ma
Won't you come around on a rainy day?
I've been thinkin' about ya
I've been on the down trying to make my way
And I don't wanna doubt ya
I don't wanna doubt but it's safe to say
You won't come around no
Say you down it don't sound so no

[Verse 2]
You keep me stuntin'
You keep me stuntin'
I need that lovin'
Yeah yeah
Hey, LA to Austin we're very poppin'
Don't care to comment
I don't even dance all Royce
Baby girl sit right back
Never seen her act like that
Homie scared to take down risks
All they wanna know is so flat
Promise I'm gonna get my plaque
Scared I would never wanna look fittin'
Scared I would never wanna look fittin'

[Hook]
Won't you come around
Won't you come around
Ooh I've been on the down
I've been on the down
Aye im never going down no
But hey, won't you come around ma

[GYYPS]

Im kissing this bitches
She gave me a run with my money
I fell in love with the money and all of these bitches

[Felly]

Through all the love and all the non sense
