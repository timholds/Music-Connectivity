Days and nights and nights and days
In silent shades of lazy grays
I call your name

It's all the same. Sitting, staring at the ceiling
Dripping painted pictures peeling
From my walls
The time just crawls

Was it yesterday?
I don't know, was I dreaming (dreaming)
Or did I lose everything
I believed in?
If you could only see what I see

Every time you leave

Imagine a world with no sky
Imagine the ocean run dry
Imagine and you'll see the view
Of my world without you

Imagine no sun and no rain
Imagine that each day's the same
It doesn't matter what I do
In a world without you

Doers doing, thinkers thinking
Lonely lovers lips are sinking
In my tea
They're burning me

Wasted weepin' someone speakin'
Through my head the bed is leakin'
Tears again
And there's no end (no,no)

Was it yesterday?
I don't know, was I dreaming (dreaming)
Or did I lose everything
I believed in?
If you could only see what I see

Every time you leave

Imagine a world with no sky
Imagine the ocean run dry
Imagine and you'll see the view
Of my world without you

Imagine no sun and no rain
Imagine that each day's the same
It doesn't matter what I do
Of my world without you

Imagine
Imagine

Imagine
Imagine

Imagine that the flowers won't bloom
Imagine that I couldn't be with you
Nothing else can get me through
In a world without you

That's my world without you here
That's my world without you there
That's my world without you baby

Imagine ...
