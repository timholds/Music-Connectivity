[Verse 1]
I know it’s warmer where you are
And it’s safer by your side
But right now I can't be what you want
Just give it time

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you and I can make it through the night
And if you and I can keep our love alive

[Chorus]
We'll find we can meet in the middle
Bodies and souls collide
Dance in the moonlight
When all the stars align
For you and I, for you and I, oh

[Verse 2]
I know it’s cold when we’re apart
And I hate to feel this die
But you can't give me what I want
Just give it time

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you and I can make it through the night
And if you and I can keep our love alive

[Chorus]
We'll find we can meet in the middle
Bodies and souls collide
Dance in the moonlight
When all the stars align
For you and I, for you and I, oh

[Bridge]
But for now we stay so far
Till our lonely limbs collide
I can’t keep you in these arms
So I'll keep you in my mind
But for now we stay so far
Till our lonely limbs collide
I can’t keep you in these arms
So I'll keep you in my mind
(Reaching out, I can't feel you now)

[Chorus]
Can we meet in the middle?
Bodies and souls collide
Dance in the moonlight
When all the stars align
For you and I, for you and I, oh
