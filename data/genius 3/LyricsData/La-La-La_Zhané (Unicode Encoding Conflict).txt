[Verse 1]
I can't imagine how it would be without you here
I heard all the people say that you're really in love with me
Please tell me you feel the same way too
That you're still wanting me
If you don't, please let me know
So I can be all alone

[Verse 2]
Day and night, I sit and wait
Wondering if
Will there ever be a day
When I get over your touch
When I get over your love
Will I get over the way you used to love me

[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter how many men I meet
(brings me back to you)
There's something about you
Something about your smile that makes me weak
(brings me back to you)
When you call my name
The sound of your voice, oh boy, it makes me weak
(brings me back to you)
If music were love
The thought of you would always make me sing

[Chorus]
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la la

[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter how many men I meet
(brings me back to you)
There's something about you
Something about your smile that makes me weak
(brings me back to you)
When you call my name
The sound of your voice, oh boy, it makes me weak
(brings me back to you)
If music were love
The thought of you would always make me sing

[Chorus]
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la la

[Bridge]
You're on my mind (You're on my mind, baby, constantly)
I'm in a daze (I'm in a daze so won't you rescue me)
You're in my dreams (You're haunting me, you keep haunting me)
You're all I need

[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't matter
It doesn't matter how many men I meet
(brings me back to you)
There's something about you
Something about your smile that makes me weak
(brings me back to you)
When you call my name
The sound of your voice, oh boy, it makes me weak
(brings me back to you)
If music were love
The thought of you would always make me sing

[Chorus]
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la
La la la
La la la
La la la, la la la

[Outro]
You're on my mind (You're on my mind, baby, constantly)
I'm in a daze (I'm in a daze so strong, won't you rescue me)
You're in my dreams (You're haunting me, you keep haunting me)
You're all I need, yeah
You're all I need
