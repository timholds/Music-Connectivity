When she puts on her cape, everyone's asleep in the house
Not too early, not too late, she knows when the time is right
Out in the air
The city's glowing and there's snow down there
Cold, crisp and quiet, now everywhere
She's got her cape on, she's flying out with all of her dreams
Fit to dreaming this world is easy as it may seem
She's got her cape on and we hide under the covers

I bury my nose in your hair, your little finger's on the button of my shirt
Right around my heart
I'm not going anywhere, when you've been flying, come sleep right next to
Me
Keep each other warm
We're good together, make the lunchbox and sing in the car
I'm not allowed to say anything and it's fine too

Out in the air
The city's glowing and there's snow everywhere
It's cold and crisp and so quiet down there
She's got her cape on, she's flying out with all of her dreams
Fit to dreaming this world is easy as it may seem
She's got her cape on and we hide -

There's fantasy and there's lying, and I need both sometimes
There's tears of joy and there's crying, and I'm with you right now

Out in the air
The city's glowing and there's snow down there
Cold, crisp and quiet, now -
She's got her cape on, she's flying out with all of her dreams
Fit to dreaming this world is easy as it may seem

There's fantasy and there's lying, and I need both sometimes
There's tears of joy and there's crying, and I'm with you right now
