[Chorus]
It overtakes me, It overtakes me
It overtakes me... Oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, It Master-Slaves me
It overtakes me... Oh oh oh I

[Chorus]
It overtakes me, It overtakes me
It overtakes me... Oh oh oh I
It overtakes me, It Wakes and Bakes me
It overtakes me... Oh oh oh I

[Verse 1]
You know that it isn't real
You'll disappear in a black hole
You know that it isn't real
Floating out of control. Oh Wow

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
And I'm there, looking up at the sky
And I'm scared, thinking about the way that I
Don't understand anything at all
And how it overtakes me... and I am just so small
Do I stand a chance?
