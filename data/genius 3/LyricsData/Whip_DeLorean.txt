[Hook 2x]
Yeah
Ima whip like i never whip, Ride like i never rode
With this liquor in my hand, feeling like the man
She just wanna see these bands while she living on that pole
Understand!
Ima dip like i never dip, fly like i never flown
With this liquor in my hand, feeling like the man
She just wanna see these bands while she get it on the flo'
Understand!

[Delorean - 1st Verse]
Pardon the pimping, we politicing for paper
Started off looking baggy, now we be getting it tapered
We sounded like dreamers, now its no longer these fables
Autobiography…. Can't let nobody alter me
Following me through this harmony soundtrack to the artery
Cognac is calling, cutting corner for comedy
Look at me na
Can't explain it go figure me out, boy we drink you under the table by any amount
I Sip like i never sip, got a zip from my folk told me not to trip
We getting it in hills tonight, mama get a lift
Tell them hating ass niggas stand a foot from a cliff
Feel a drift, from the click that name dropping for bopping
Kubiak with the doobie rap, give them bitches no options
Whats popping? Im saying
Im fluent whenever drape me in ruby and bezzles
Im cooler than ever, watch me just do this forever

[Hook - 2x]
Ima whip like i never whip, whip. Ride like i never rode
With this liquor in my hand, feeling like the man
She just wanna see these bands while she living on that pole
Understand!
Ima dip like i never dip, fly like i never flown
With this liquor in my hand, feeling like the man
She just wanna see these bands while she get it on the flo'
Understand!

[Big K.R.I.T. - 2nd verse]
Shit…
All reign K.R
Im I.T. with this AR
Play games till the pay off
You rookies better play ball, cuz we all playoff
Then we pro bowl, then we pop bottles in slow mo
Touch down like what na, seem like y'all need new goals
Windows tinted, thousand count linen, fuck on Egyptian cotton
She bougie but she still bopping
Bitch I dig you all the same
Introduce yourself to my friends, hell i forgot your name
Because your girlfriends got girlfriends and they pearl swirl like hurricanes
Instagram my lifestyle, look at all these skylines
Toast to all the shit that i bought and shit im about to buy
Price tags, like whats that? I ain't tripping on those numbers
I dodge the winters, in december, just to buy the summer
Trip to Sweden turn 24 hours days into 36
Broke never suited me but being rich a perfect fit
Bi-lingual "Wo ai ni" - i hear that from my asian bitch
Life i live is C'est Si Bon
Shoutout to Eartha Kitt
(whip like i never whip)

[Hook 2x - DeLorean]
Ima whip like i never whip, whip. Ride like i never rode
With this liquor in my hand, feeling like the man
She just wanna see these bands while she living on that pole
Understand!
Ima dip like i never dip, fly like i never flown
With this liquor in my hand, feeling like the man
She just wanna see these bands while she get it on the flo'
Understand!

[Delorean - 3rd verse]
Dipping in dollars daddy, we doing it daily
Pushing a 100, haters be pushing up daises
Sipping the finest liquor she bout' persuade me
Im aiming at women sunny im gunning for ladies
Pay me just like you weigh me don't take me to court
Im 6'4 oh lord don't play me for short
Just came off the porch, do like a player suppose
I drop on the first go get a whip on the 4th
Dip it in chrome then i go whip it some more
I got it, got it yo cotton be itching a ho
She live on that pole, mama name lira she cold
She counting them bands right to this lyrical flow
Fully stunting never caught me riding dummies
Im smarting than these boys Im well equipped
I make em yell church when i park no fellowship
Bring the light straight to the dark for better shit
Lets embellish it

[Hook 2x - DeLorean]
Ima whip like i never whip, whip. Ride like i never rode
With this liquor in my hand, feeling like the man
She just wanna see these bands while she living on that pole
Understand!
Ima dip like i never dip, fly like i never flown
With this liquor in my hand, feeling like the man
She just wanna see these bands while she get it on the flo'
Understand!
