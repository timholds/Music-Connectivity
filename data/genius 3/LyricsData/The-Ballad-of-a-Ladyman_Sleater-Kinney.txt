[Verse 1]
Eye cream and thigh cream
How 'bout a get high cream?
Nothing I do smoothes out the feelings of being used
Ballad of a Ladyman

[Verse 2]
Freak that I am, live in Japan
Let's rock with the tough girls in this part of the world
Take a photograph
Portrait of a Ladyman

[Chorus]
Are we holding on to our pride a bit too long?
Are we breaking on guitars?
Are we breaking you apart?

[Verse 3]
They say I've gone too far with the image I've got
And they know I'd make a mint with new plastic skin
And a hit on the radio!
Temptations of a Ladyman

[Verse 4]
I could be demure like girls who are soft
For boys who are fearful of getting an earful
But I gotta rock!
I'd rather be a Ladyman!

[Chorus]
Are we holding on to our pride a bit too long?
Are we breaking on guitars?
Are we breaking you apart?

[Post-Chorus]
How many times will you decide?
(You sit at home with an alibi)
How many lives will you define?
(In case they call and ask you why)
How much control should we give up of our lives?
(All you do is go, "ooh ahh ohh"
You're out of control but saying, "ooh ahh ooh")

[Chorus]
Are we holding on to our pride a bit too long?
Are we breaking on guitars?
Are we breaking you apart?

[Post-Chorus]
How many times will you decide?
(You sit at home with an alibi)
How many lives will you define?
(In case they call and ask you why)
How much control should we give up of our lives?
(All you do is go, "ooh ahh ohh"
You're out of control but saying, "ooh ahh ooh")
