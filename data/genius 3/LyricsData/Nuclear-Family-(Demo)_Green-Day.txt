I'm gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round!
Like a Ferris Wheel like its breaking down
Drinking's Angel's piss, gonna crash and burn
I just want some action so gimme my turn

Like a Chinese Government conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family
Staring up at you

It's lookin' like another bad Comedy
Just as long as it comes in Hi-Fidelity
For me too

Can you hear the sound comin' over the hill?
Gotta move my feet! it's comin' in for the kill
Ba-baby, baby it's a blowout!
OH YEAH!
Like a Nuclear Bomb
And it won't be long
'till i detonate

Like a Chinese Government conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family
Staring up at you

It's lookin' like another bad Comedy
Just as long as it comes in Hi-Fidelity
For me too ALL RIGHT!

WOW!

I'm gonna ride the world like a merry-go-round!
Like a Ferris Wheel like its breaking down
Screa-screa-screamin' Bloody Murder! OH YEAH
Like a Nuclear Bomb
And it won't be long
'till i detonate

Like a Chinese Government conspiracy
It's the death of a nuclear family
Staring up at you

It's lookin' like another bad Comedy
Just as long as it comes in Hi-Fidelity
For me too
