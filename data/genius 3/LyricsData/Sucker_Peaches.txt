Thought you were a problem
Thought you were a problem
Thought you were a problem
And you're a stretcher case baby

Say you could kiss like a dream
Say your kisses like peaches and cream
But while you're here
That don't mean a thing
'Cause you're a stretcher case baby

Thought you were a problem (problem)
Thought you were a problem (problem)
Thought you were a problem (problem)
You're a stretcher case baby

Make a little floor for the 30 year old whore
Soon you'll be let out
Not for your ecstasy but
It's your autopsy

Thought you were a problem (problem)
Thought you were a problem (problem)
Thought you were a problem (problem)
And you're a stretcher case baby

Sucker wanna pay so what do you say?
I'm gonna scream
You caught a brick in your face
That's why
You're a stretcher case baby

Thought you were a problem (problem)
Thought you were a problem (problem)
Thought you were a problem (problem)
And you're a stretcher case baby
Thought you were a problem (problem)
Thought you were a problem (problem)
Thought you were a problem (problem)
And you're a stretcher case baby
You
