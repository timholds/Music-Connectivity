[Verse 1]
When you're alone, lying in bed
I wonder what goes, inside of your head
Or when you're awake, then fold your spread
Then iron your clothes, and toast your bread
With thoughts occur, with pictures come
You cleaned your plate, just scraped the crumbs
You grab your coat, you grab your phone
You head to work and start to zone
Tell me where does your mind go?
What do you see through the blindfold?
Is it your future, is it your past?
Does it makes you stress, does it make you laugh?
You sit at your desk, you day dream
But tell me do you see the same things?
The times pass, the days change
And all this time I'm still wondering

[Hook]
Is it me, is it me, in the feelings that you hold in?
Is it me that you think of when you're flowing
Is it me, is it me, in the feelings that you hold in?
Is it me, in between all your moments?

[Verse 2]
You're more than the one, I don't believe in list
Don't care how the world's perceiving this
These hurricanes, catastrophes
Don't mean a thing when you're my fantasy
Get help to change my reality
Your voice is such a beautiful sight to see
I know it's cheesy, but please believe me
No way get imagination would deceive
Talk to me long, talk to me right
My manager don't talk how she like
But she don't know you quite like I do
Other boys call but you be lying to them
You see your phone flash line two
And once again, I have found you
The times pass, the days change
And all this time I'm still wondering
