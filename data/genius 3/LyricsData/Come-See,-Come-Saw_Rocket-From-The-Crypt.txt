Well, come see, come saw, come cruelty
When it's hungry, it's gonna fight. (gonna fight) (or gonna bite)
And it chalks one up so hasty
If you do, it just might. (just might)
Well come see, come saw, come here boy
You're someone that we like
So drop the bark of abusing
Cause if you do, you're dead now. (dead now or good night)

We don't share ??
?? to please
We don't take another step
?? abusing ?? drink I take ??
We don't want to play ??
??
Now, they're useless
Come see, come saw, come dead ahead

Hold our hands like yous do
No matter, feels good, it ain't right. (ain't right)
And when your sweat drips, what we groove to
And abuse you, alright (alright)
Come see, come saw, come here boy
You're something that we like
So get back to the basics
Cause you know we just might

We don't share ??
?? to please
We don't take another step
?? abusing ?? drink I take ??
We don't want to play ??
?? Now, they're useless
Come see, come saw, come dead ahead
Although it's useless
Come see, chop our heads
Now, they're useless
Come see, come saw, come dead ahead
Although it's useless
Come see, come saw, come...

We don't share ??
?? to please
We don't take another step

Now, they're useless
Come see, come saw, come dead ahead
Although it's useless
Come see, chop our heads
Although it's toothless
Come see, come saw, come dead ahead
Now, they're useless
Come see, come saw, come...
