[Verse]
Falling over, bending backwards
My mind's a fracture of all the things you do
Looking over, feeling awkward
I'm over thinking, time is falling through


[Chorus]
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful, I'm bashful, I'm bashful
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful, I'm bashful


[Verse]
Getting over myself, looking forwards
Will do my utmost, to impress you
Maybe make some money, buy a cream Skoda?
It's not a flying palindrome but i guess it will have to do

[Chorus]
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful, I'm bashful, I'm bashful
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful, I'm bashful

[Bridge]
I know I'm really young to you but I want to prove
You may think what I say isn't true
I understand, you may misconstrue
I'm ... to you, ... to you
So... baby back to you

[Chorus]
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful, I'm bashful, I'm bashful
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful, I'm bashful, I'm bashful
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, I'm bashful
A countenance accountable for the lack of mental in my bones
I'm bashful, still bashful
But I'm flexible
