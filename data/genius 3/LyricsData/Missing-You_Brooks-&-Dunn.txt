[Verse 1]
Everytime I think of you
I always catch my breath
And I'm still standing here and your miles away
And I'm wondering why you left
And there's a storm that's raging
Through my frozen heart tonight
I hear your name in certain circles
And it always makes me smile
I spend my time thinking about you
And it's almost driving me wild
And there's a heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

[Chorus]
I ain't missing you
Since you've been gone...away
I ain't missing you
No matter what I might say

[Verse 2]
There's a message in the wire and
I'm sending you this signal tonight
You don't know how desperate I've become
And it looks like I'm losing this fight
In your world I have no meaning
I try so hard to understand
And it's my heart that's breaking
Down this long distance line tonight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
There's a message that I'm sending out
Like a telegraph to your soul
And if I can't bridge this distance
Stop this heartbreak overload

[Chorus]

[Outro]
I ain't missing you[x2]
