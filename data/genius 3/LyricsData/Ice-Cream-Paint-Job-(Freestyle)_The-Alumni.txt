[Intro:]
DJ Break 'Em Off
Hood certified you bastards
Free Radio, you motherfuckers

[Verse 1: Big Sant]
Big Sant, Go-rilla
Top chopped off, won't find nothin' trilla
Pimpin' makes ya hard bitch, I'm 'bout my skrilla
Two bad bitches, chocolate and vanilla
I was candy paint pimpin' down 6th street Texas
East side of Austin, rippin' up a Lexus
Mississippi mack shit, backflip, roof off
T-Top old school, movin' like a U-Haul
Who do I ball? Boss hog, big dog
3rd Coast all star, rims big, tint doors
(?) gonna go hard, you thought wrong
I was on my 4th coat of butterscotch, ice cream paint job
Who ya with?
Girl get up in if you never seen doors that remind you of Benz
I'mma win, they took a loss
She took a look and saw a boss

[Hook:] x2
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Cream on the inside, clean on the outside
Ice-Ice-Ice cream paint job

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
Mr. Ice Cream Man what they call me
Sittin' in a bucket of vanilla I was crawlin'
Tryin' chill dash, seats marshmallow
Pop my top, school double yellow
Butter-pecan keep her on the scene
I really dig your flavor shawdy, cookies and cream
Rock and Roll lean, sprinkles I be toppin' them
White and Brown, shawdy pink, real neapolitan
Baskin' like Robbin and them, Ben and Jerry too
Chopper in the trunk, don't make me strawberry you
He ain't said nothin', do it myself
When she saw me in the club, made her ice cream melt
How much ice cream left?
They like Krizzle what they call you
Yea my swag Blue Bell, shawdy, you should leak it on you
Wrist deep freezer, chain ice cold
Dunk on 28 inch oreos
My ride
