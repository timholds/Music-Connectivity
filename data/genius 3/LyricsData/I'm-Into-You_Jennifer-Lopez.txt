[Intro: Jennifer Lopez & Lil Wayne]
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (uh)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh (yes)
Na-na-na-na-na-na na-na-na-eh
(Miss Lopez, uh um)

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Hi, I’m Tune,  the man on the moon
I live on the beach, get the sand out you're shoes
And all of that changed since I met you
So we can leave that old shit in the restroom
Young Money!

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopez]
You got me and I could not defend it
I tried, but I had to surrender
Your style got me under the spell
Let me no other choice but to get down

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez + Lil Wayne]
It’s too late, it’s too late
It’s too late, it’s too late
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
When I look into your eyes, it’s over
You got me hooked with your love controller
I’m tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah

[Verse 3: Jennifer Lopez]
Listen, now I’m strong, baby, I bring the fire on
Sharp shooter, you can call me "The Zion"
I’m not the one easy to get to
But all that changed, baby, when I met you

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez + Lil Wayne]
It’s too late, it’s too late
It’s too late, it’s too late
You got it, you got it
You got it, you got it

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
When I look into your eyes, it’s over
You got me hooked with your love controller
I’m tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah

[Verse 4: Lil Wayne]
Okay, I’m into you, like you never knew
I’m falling for you, baby, I need a parachute
Pussy so wet, I need a wetsuit
You’re way too fly, I could be your jet fuel
Now tell me what you like, I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, you can overwhelm me
It’s too late, it’s too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
When I look into your eyes, it’s over
You got me hooked with your love controller
I’m tripping and I could not get over
I feel lucky, like a four leaf clover
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah
I’m into you, I’m into you, I’m into you, yeah
