[Verse 1]
It started in your heart
It started in my dreams
You took up all your time
You took up everything

Stars in the mirror
Always look so big
And every night I wanna do it

You started in your top
You never went that way
You took up all your time
You took up everyday

Stars in the mirror
Always look so big
And every night I wanna do it

Upside down, you turn me on
It's like fire to the flame
It's like fire to the flame

[Hook]
And we'll dance the night away (4x)

[Bridge]
And everything, and anything
You just don't have 'em yeah

[Verse 1]
