No I won't be saved
No I won't be saved

Heart is in my mouth
As I turn my face away
And I walk down the deserted streets
Desolate and grey
Nothing more to say
Whispering your name
Under winter skies
Imprisoned by the thought of you
Captured by your eyes
Mesmerised

No I won't be saved
I will always be enslaved
No I won't be saved
In my heart your name engraved

I'm down on my knees
In a willing sacrific
I won't confess my transgressions
I won't repent my vice
I'll pay the price

No I won't be saved

I will always be enslaved
No I won't be saved
In my heart your name engraved
No I won't be saved
I won't be saved
No I won't be saved
I won't be saved

The visions come at night
I feel I'm hypnotised
I tremble as I fall into
The furnace of your eyes
And out of sight

No I won't be saved
I will always be enslaved
No I won't be saved
I will love you to the grave
No I won't be saved
I will always be enslaved
No I won't be saved
In my heart your name engraved

Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
Falling down
