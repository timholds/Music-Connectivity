An *** perched on the counter
But my mind always wanders
Rapids brought me home.Since I saw you up there in the cupboard
My leafy heart grew fonder
To your self I want to show
Looking at your glow all day and night
Despite you being out of reach
None of this, I beam with delight
I'm stuck on you honey
I'm stuck on you, yeah
X2
You're my gold at the end of the rainbow
My pot of gold
You had my heart and slam drunk
Then we get confused
Be together
When loves starting to break down
It will last forever
I'm stuck on you honey
I'm stuck on you, yeah
X7
I'm stuck on you honey
I'll stick with you
