Where are we going this fine morning?
What are we doing this fine day?
We're doing the same as every morning
We're staying inside on this fine morning
Staying inside on this fine day
We'll stare at a screen like every morning
And outside the window spring is here
We're going to hibernate all year
Under a pile of A4 snowflakes
'Cause we're the new generation
We are the battery human
But we were born to be free range
We're got the, the whole at our fingers
We've got the whole world in our hands
We get the blues as we grow richer
'Cause we need to fix our loose connection
Out in the natural World Wide Web
We're humans evolved in three dimensions
We were tuned in by natural selection
And we need to go online each day
But inside we don't get no reception
So join the new revolution
To free the battery human
'Cause we were born to be free range
We are the new generation
We are the battery human
But we were born to be free range
