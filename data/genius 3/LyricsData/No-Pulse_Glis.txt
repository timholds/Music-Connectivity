You've been away
How does it feel?
You hide inside a space
When nothing's real

You lost your turn
We moved ahead
The only voice of comfort's
Inside your head

You tried to get away
Away from me

No pulse
You're lying on your back
Just can't get ahead because
You're running off the track

No pulse
You're lying in your bed
Just shooting at the targets
So you better play dead

You always get what you want
You never get what you need

No pulse
You're lying on your back
Just can't get ahead because
You're running off the track

No pulse
You're lying in your bed
Just shooting at the targets
So you better play dead
