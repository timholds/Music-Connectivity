Drivin down the road with a couple more miles to go, Im so close but they dont know, got some freaky hoes and weed to blow, rock the cleanest clothes.My life different from every single kid you know, places i go out on my own, hoes stay blowin up my phone but i wanna be left alone. Doin shows every 4 or 5 cities in a row hit me with some dough cause they know im bout to blow. You can always say no if you wanna lay low but you look so good you need to get up on that floor. Dont you feel good? Dont you feel great? I feel so fly and i hope you can relate. Got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee. Its the same old dude but a brand new me. I been up and ive been down, thought i was the coolest motherfucker around. But im just another face in the crowd, i said im just another face in the crowd. They tell me its impossible to do it I'd be stupid if i tried but im using a maneuver im just movin them aside. Im just tryna make some music for the ride listen to it when you drive destination you arrive. Russell Crow its a beautiful mind, imagine what ill do with some time usually find me chillin up in jupiter Im so happy you mad some khakis of some sags, moms said you can see my ass and she laughed blindfolden in a turn pike hopin I dont crash. stashin the weed under the passenger seat hope these 16 wheelers dont crash into me. People takin pictures when I pass in the street. Zoom by all fast in my seat belt now you know how we felt.Dont you feel good? Dont you feel great? I feel so fly and i hope you can relate. Got some brand new shoes and a brand new tee. Its the same old dude but a brand new me. I been up and ive been down, thought i was the coolest motherfucker around. But im just another face in the crowd, i said im just another face in the crowd
