[Verse 1]
Stranded, lost inside myself
My own worst friend and my own closest enemy
I'm branded, maladjusted
Never trusted anyone, let alone myself

[Chorus]
I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

[Verse 2]
Elected, the rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot
No meaning and no healing
Self-loathing freak and introverted deviot

[Chorus]
I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

[Bridge]
Say whatever, oh, whoa
Say whatever, oh, whoa
Shoot!

[Verse 3]
Stranded, lost inside myself
My own worst friend and my own closest enemy
Elected, the rejected
I perfect the science of the idiot

[Chorus]
I must insist
On being a pessimist
I'm a loner in a catastrophic mind

[Outro]
I'm gettin' pissed
I'm a worthless pessimist
I'm a loner in a claustrophobic mind
