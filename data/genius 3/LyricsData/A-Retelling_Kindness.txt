I saw the photos
The mess in the flat
Our wedding albums
That we’re not getting back

Two days in bed
From image alone
Turn off those old songs
They remind me of home

Speak now my children
With different voice
Learning new language
From the neighbourhood boys

You won’t know our garden
But you won’t fear the gun
Our fruit trees unpicked
The paint fades in sun

Songs go unspoken
Torn books unread
Phones go unanswered

A dialling tone

The doctor is sailing
A coast line recedes
The twilight is fading
A life begins
A life begins
