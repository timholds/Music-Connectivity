Seems like everyday you cross my mind
Even after such a long long time
I still think about the way you smile
It tears me apart to know that it won't ever be the same again
No it won't ever be the same again

Now I'm sorry that I left you
I can't go back
I can't change anything
I'm sorry that I said "so long"
I never meant to hurt you
Sorry I waited so long

Not really sure what I'm doing back here
Why I stayed away for all those years
I guess I had to try to find myself
I'm the only one to blame
No one else can ever make it all go away
Or make up, make up for all my mistakes

Now I'm sorry that I left you
I can't go back
I can't change anything
I'm sorry that I said "so long"

Now I'm sorry that I left you
I can't go back
I can't change anything
I'm sorry that I said "so long"
I never meant to hurt you
Sorry I waited so long
Sorry I waited so long

If I could do this all over
I'd want to go back, I'd want to go back
If I could only start over
I'd take it all back
I'd take it all back for you
I'd take it all back for you

Now I'm sorry that I left you
I can't go back
I can't change anything
I'm sorry I said "so long"

And I'm sorry that I left you
I can't go back
I can't change anything
I'm sorry I said "so long"
I never meant to hurt you
Sorry I waited so long
Sorry I waited so long
Sorry I waited so long

That I waited so long
