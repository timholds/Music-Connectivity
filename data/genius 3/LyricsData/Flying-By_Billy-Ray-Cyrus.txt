[Verse 1]
It's bottles and bibs, rattles and cribs
Three am's again and again
Comfort the cry
Man, it's flying by

[Verse 2]
Swings and slides and tricycle rides
Skinning up knees and falling out of trees
It's like it's never gonna end
But it's flying by

[Chorus]
You better hold on tight to those little lives
In the blink of an eye it's out of sight
I know, I know to go so slow
But it's flying by

[Verse 3]
Then it's braces and boots and bad attitudes
Boys and phones and every change in moods
Trying times, man, but you'll survive
And it's supposed to be home at ten
You're late again
Where the heck you been
When you're yelling and screaming
It don't seem like it's flying by
But it's flying by

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
There they go on their own
Flying by
You're waving good bye with a tear in your eye
I know, I know you go so slow but it's flying by

[Verse 5]
They come back home and what do you know
Them kids have got some kids of their own
You can't believe how much they've grown
And where the time's gone

[Verse 6]
You look in the mirror there's gray in your hair
You're wondering how the world did that get there
It just ain't fair how it's flying by

[Chorus]

[Verse 7]
When it's hospital beds
Last words said, did I do enough
Holding hands and being there for the leaving

[Verse 8]
It's a line of cars parked on a hill
Family and friends perfectly still
A prayer and a song as they lowered it down into the ground

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Yeah, it seems so slow but it's flying by
It's flying by
It's flying by
It's flying by
Enjoy the ride
