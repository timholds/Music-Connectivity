[Chorus][x2]
Think you got to keep me iced, you don't
Think I'm going to spend your cash, I won't
Even if you were broke
My love don't cost a thing

[Verse 1]
When you rolled up in the Escalade
Saw that dub you gave to the valet
Knew that it was game when you looked at me
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling

Saw you later in the corner booth
Raising up a toast so I would notice you
But your hard to miss think you outta know
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control

All that matter's is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 2]
When I took a chance, thought you'd understand
Baby, credit cards aren't romance
So you're trying to buy what's already yours
What I need from you is not available in stores

Seen a side of you that I really feel
Doing way too much, never keep it real
If it doesn't change, got to hit the road
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys I've got to go

All that matter's is
That you treat me right
Give me all the things I need
That money can't buy, yeah

[Chorus][x2]

[Verse 3]
You think the money that you make
Can substitute the time you take
To get the keys into my heart
Then you can win my heart, and know what's in my heart

I think you need to take some time
To show me that your love is true
There's more than dollar signs in you
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart

[Chorus][x3]
