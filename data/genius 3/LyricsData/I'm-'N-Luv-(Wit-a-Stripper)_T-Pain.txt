[Intro: T-Pain]
Goddamn, little momma'
You know you thick as hell you know what I'm sayin
Matter fact
After the club you know what I'm talkin' 'bout
Me and my niggas gone be together you know what I'm sayin'
I ain't gon worry 'bout them really though
I'm just lookin' at you, yeah, you know
You got them big ass hips god damn!

[Verse 1: T-Pain]
Got the body of a goddess
Got eyes butter pecan brown I see you girl
Droppin low
She comin down from the ceiling to the flo'
Yea she know what she doin' (yea yea yea)
She doin' that right thang (yea yea yea yea-eah)
I need to get her over to my crib and do that night thang
Cause I'm in love with a stripper

[Hook x2]
She poppin, she rollin, she rollin
She climbin that pole and I'm in love with a stripper
She trippin, she playin, she playin
I'm not goin nowhere girl I'm stayin, I'm in love with a stripper

[Verse 2: T-Pain]
Out of all the girls she be the hottest
Likin' the way she break it down I see you girl
Spinnin wide
And she lookin' at me right in my eyes
Yea she got my attention (yea yea yea)
Did I forget to mention
I need to get her over to my crib and do that night thang
Cause I'm in love with a stripper

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Mike Jones]
She's every man's dream, she's God's gift to Earth
Women they love 'em too, that's what you call a woman's worth
See I love all the strippers, because they show me love
They know I never pay, it's free whenever I hit the club
But I can't even lie, the girls are here so fly
She slidin' up and down that pole got me mesmerized
Mike Jones don't ever trick but goddamn she thick
I can't lie, I must admit

[Hook x2]

[Verse 4: T-Pain]
She can pop it she can lock it
Teddy Pendergrass down I'm bout to see this sexy girl
In my bed
She don't know what she is doin' to my head
Yea She turnin' tricks on me (yea yea yea)
She dont even know me (yea yea yea-eah)
I'd have got her over to my crib to do that night thing
Cause I'm in love with a stripper

[Hook x4]
