(simon says put your hands on me)
Listen close, gotta know, pay some attention
Don't ya know, you should know, I'm in control
Lend an ear, try to hear, take some direction
Direction, (direction), direction

Follow the signs
See them flashing in the sky
I'll be your guide
Let me come inside

If you go with the flow, take it slow
You could be my baby
Simon says to do what I say
If it's good, then we could, and you would
If you really want me
Simon says to do what I say

Simon says put your hands on me
Simon says you can freak with me
Simon says you can come real close
(uh-uh, uh-uh, not that close)
Simon says we can dance all night
Simon says you can make it right
Simon says I'm in control now, and we can roll nowâ€¦

Pace yourself, brace yourself, it's not complicated
Like the game that we played back in the day (back in the day)
Now's the time, don't go wrong, let's just get faded (faded)

Follow the signs
See them flashing in the sky
I'll be your guide
Let me take a dive

If you go with the flow, take it slow
You could be my baby
Simon says to do what I say
If it's good, then we could, and you would
If you really want me
Simon says to do what I say
If you go with the flow, take it slow
You could be my baby
Simon says to do what I say
If it's good, then we could, and you would
If you really want me
Simon says to do what I say

Don't you really wanna put your hands on me?
Don't you really wanna get freaky?
Don't you really wanna come up real close?
(oh yeah, that close)
Don't you really wanna dance all night?
Don't you wanna stay â€˜til the morning light?
(come on, come on!)

This isn't like other games that you played
Not just a typical game of charades
See where you move and the closer you'll get, what's next?
Just how far we go
Just how much we show

If you go with the flow, take it slow
You could be my baby
Simon says to do what I say
If it's good, then we could, and you would
If you really want me
Simon says to do what I say
If you go with the flow
Do what I say
If it's good then we couldâ€¦
If you go with the flow, take it slow
You could be my baby

Simon says put your hands on me
Simon says you can freak with me
Simon says put your hands on me
Simon says you can freak with me
Simon says put your hands on me
Simon says you can freak with me
