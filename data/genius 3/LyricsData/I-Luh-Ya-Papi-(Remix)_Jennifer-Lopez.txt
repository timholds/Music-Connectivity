[Bridge 1: Jennifer Lopez]
I put it down for a brother like you
Give it to you right in the car, that's you
We can first give you some of this, that's you
And you're all loving that J.Lo, true

[Verse 1: Jennifer Lopes]
Hold up, I can get you thrown up
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun up
All the time I hear her talk
Put a pin in it, now I'm ready, let it rock
Keep it number 1, that's easy mathematics
Keep it number 1, baby, ain't no static
Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at these legs
No brakes, go green, no red
If you wanna kill the body, gotta start with the head
Put it on you, I'mma need about 4-5 beds
Cause I love my papi

[Bridge 2: Jennifer Lopez]
I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you, and I need you know
Ain't had none like you in a while

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi

[Verse 2: Jennifer Lopes]
Ole 24 hour
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it
You can drop it how you want, I ain't trying to call Miley
I'm lovin' me some you
Started from the bottom, baby, then we went roof
Cause I love my papi

[Bridge 2: Jennifer Lopez]
I didn't see it, but I see it now
Think I love you, and I need you know
Ain't had none like you in a while

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi

[Verse 3: Big Sean]
Do you love me? Do you swear?
Am I still the one? Even when I'm not there
Cause you know how it go and go
When you wanna go and go
Have you seen what's her face?
Is her number in your phone?
And your answer's yes and yes
But you still say no and no
Even though I know you know
I know I know you know I know
You know? It sound dumb-de-dumb-dumb
They say what we want's wrong, fuck it
Least know what we want
And it sucks to see you cry
Know a brokenhearted girl could make the whole world drown
And even though your makeup smears
Man I'm the one that's been the clown, why the fuck we around?
Cause girl you know I got that jaw drop shit
Plus I know your insecurities, that mall cop shit
I give you that screwface shit
Bring the ugly side out, two faced shit
Tryin' all new ways shit
One night turn into a few days shit

[Verse 4: Jennifer Lopez]
I think I love just who you are
We haven't grown apart, this is just the start
Where life begin all the way to the end
And we started as friends, boy I do love

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
I luh ya papi, I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
I luh ya papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
Yeah, that my papi
I luh ya, luh ya, luh ya, luh ya papi
