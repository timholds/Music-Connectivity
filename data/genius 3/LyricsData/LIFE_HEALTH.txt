[Verse 1]
We lie awake at night
We're tired of waiting
Too high to sleep
Too tired to try

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is strange
We die, and we don't know why

[Chorus]
I don’t know what I want, know that I don’t know what I want
I don’t know what I want, know that I don’t know what I want
No, nobody knows, nobody does, nobody knows
No, nobody knows, nobody does, nobody knows

[Verse 2]
We lie awake at night
We're tired of waiting
Yeah life, is pain
But I'm afraid to die

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We fall apart
It's not our fault
We fall apart
Life is strange but it's all we've got

[Chorus x2]
