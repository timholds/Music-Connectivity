[Verse 1]
Good morning, my child
Stay with me a while
You not got any place to be
Won't you sit a spell with me
You've got diamonds for eyes
It's time for you to rise
And evaporate in the sun
Sometimes it can weigh a ton

[Chorus]
Keep all your crows away
Hold skinny wolves at bay
In silver piles of smiles
May all your days be gold, my child

[Verse 2]
A necklace of leaves
Spirits in the trees
And drown all the clocks 'til there's none
Little ambient in the sun

[Chorus]
Keep all your crows away
Hold skinny wolves at bay
In silver piles of smiles
May all your days be gold, my child

[Verse 3]
Good morning, my child
Stay with me a while
And evaporate in the sun
Sometimes it can weigh a ton

[Chorus]
Keep all your crows away
Hold skinny wolves at bay
In silver piles of smiles
May all your days be gold, my child

[Outro]
May all your days be gold, my child
May all your days be gold, my child
May all your days be gold, my child
