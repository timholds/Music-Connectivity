Caramel kisses you send my way
I won't complain just don't go away
(Repeat)

You made my heart melt the other day
When we laid by the fire in the middle of May
It was so romantic I'll say
When you gave me your love in your caramel way

Caramel kisses you send my way
I won't complain just don't go away
(Repeat)

Many times before and many times again
You'll recall to me the reasons why
You are more than my friend
It's not only because you were there for my kids
It's the simple things like your carmel kiss

112:
Oh, living life with you can be so right

Loving you through the night
Your love is so amazing, baby (boy your love is so)
Never have I felt a love like this
Baby I can't resist (I can't resist)
Something about your kiss, something about your kiss (So caramel...)

Caramel kisses you send my way
I won't complain just don't go away
(Repeat)

Caramel kisses, caramel kisses
Caramel kisses, don't go away
Caramel kisses, caramel kisses
Caramel kisses, don't go away

Caramel kisses you send my way
I won't complain just don't go away
(Repeat)
