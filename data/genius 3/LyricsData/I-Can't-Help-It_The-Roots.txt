[Hook - Mercedes Martinez]
I, I, I Can't Help It, I, I, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It
I, I, I Can't Help It, I, I, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It
I Can't Help It, I Can't Help It

[Verse 1 - Malik B]
Live with it, that's how I survive with it
Talk jive with it, you take a dive with it
Connive with it, depart and arrive with it
Harsh thrive, that's why it's part I with it
I did it, make rhymes in five minutes
Mind of a dentist, crimes of a menace
Press rewind, see what you find in my image
Take you niggas back to the line of the scrimmage
'Riq, you know we pull a freak with the flow
Talk's cheap, that's why we speak with the dough
Ill technique show I'm sleek with the flow
It's cold outside, nigga, sleep with the snow
I tweek in the low tone, freak with the ozone
I can't help hiding my secrets that's so known
I only do what I got to cause it's possible
And climbin' over whatever's known as an obstacle

[Hook]

[Verse 2 - Black Thought]
Ugh, I Can't Help It, maybe I'm selfish
Maybe the way I'm runnin' is becomin' a health risk
All I can see is smoke through tortoise shell
Gazelle 650's, I'm feelin' like I'm makin' a sales pitch
My head already so heavy, it's makin' the scales tip
I got my own pressure and got everyone else's
I'm rehabilitated, still feelin' rebellious
Candidate of heart failure, more pills then Elvis
In a layer cake, half-chocolate, half-velvet
I'm listenin' to some Howe Melvin
I got too many options, there's so many toxins
Yo, ain't no really tellin' what we killin' ourselves with
I lit a cigarette and inhaled it
I'm thinkin' of some rhymes more iller then a threatening ailment
I'm on some bomb threat in the mail shit
Because of all the things I dealt with, nigga, I Can't Help It

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Porn]
I never said I'm ready to die, but I accept it
Never said I'm ready for war, but I'm protected
I don't even know when it's comin', but I expect it
Lost all semblance of hope, so now I'm left with
Nervous conditions, addictions, in addition
To vixens that mixed in with the wrong crowd
My life is on a flight that's goin' down
My mother had an abortion for the wrong child
With the time I felt love, that's gone now
Been replaced by purple rains and some storm clouds
Misery love misery
So why make friends? Let's make some enemies
And now I got a habit that wasn't meant for me
Now I'm in a marriage that wasn't meant to be
One more reason to change identity
The cars, the crime, K's, penalties

[Hook]
