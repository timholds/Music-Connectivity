Yall don't wanna see Chris The Lyricist drop
That ain't never gon' happen, I ain't never gon' stop
Put my album out, it ain't never gon' flop
I came from the bottom, now I'm reaching for the top
Tell you one thing about running from a cop:
Rap songs don't tell you that you gon' get popped
Everything was fine 'till you once get shot
Now you bleeding on the block
End up like Pac
How do I do it? Where'd I get my skill from?
Citizen of light, telling truth, I'm a pilgrim
I stay in the light, residence is the kingdom
Never dumb it down, it's my choice, it's my freedom
I could say what I want and I'm looking, weeping, seeking
Holy Trinity baby, I ain't talking 'bout a threesome
I ain't showing weakness, defeating me is just blasphemy
The best has to be CiNo, you can ask for me

I ain't even scrap when I rap, I ain't trapped
You know Chris The Lyricist, yeah I'm back on the track
Tryna get smacked so fat on the map
People getting jealous for the skill I don't lack
Enjoying all the gifts I'm receiving and I'm giving
I ain't never gonna quit, I ain't leaving, I'm just living
I'm the equivallence of the real Genesis
Positive side, man I'm not the trebulance
People messing with the Revelation is irrelevant
I follow God, but I'm too hard to be celibate
I'm telling Mr. Letterman there's trouble with my brotheren
I ain't quitting, giving up or settling for nothing, and
People getting scared, frightened, hiding and running
Talking "Hip-Hop lost it's soul", but it's real and abundant
I'm a mere MC spreading wide and endlessly
With a fantasy there's a spot in Hip-Hop made just for me!
