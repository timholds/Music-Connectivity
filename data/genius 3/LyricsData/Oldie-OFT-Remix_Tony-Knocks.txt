[Verse 2: Tony]
14 years old with the nerve of rappin' on this oldie beat
14 years ago mama pulled a nerve tryna deal with me
A black annoyance playin' outside always runnin' in these streets
Thought I was runnin' these streets till I came to reality
A tragedy, that's what its come up to since I'm on this beat and
Tragically, killing beats is not how its set up for me so
Magically, I'll just kill this this verse with a couple sylllabes
A sylllabe, syllables or ambigrams you feeling me?
Said I need a better mic, I'll just stick with my potato
Long as my verses are killin' that's as far as my raps will go
Stick to the producing game, that's all I ever hear
Sorry, I can't understand, there's money stuffed up in my ear
I'm poor for now but pretty soon I'll be up on the morning news
Tellin' ya'll 'bout my childhood blues, and how all I watched was Blue's Clues
But right now I'm just tryna' live, Brooklyn is hard for a kid
Music helps me stay active, from this world I'm evasive
