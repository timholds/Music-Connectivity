Love, love will come find you
Just to remind you of who you are
Oh love, it will forsake you
Threaten to break you, take what you got

Everybody laughs, everybody cries
Oh it could hurt you baby
But give it a little try
See that's the thing about love

Friends, sometimes will blind you
Sneak up behind you, you can't give enough
Then life, it will embrace you
Totally amaze you, so you don't give up

Everybody laughs, everybody cries
Sure it could hurt you baby
But give it a little try
See that's the thing about love

Oh tell me that I'm not the only that's going through it all
Oh sometimes I feel like I'm the only one going through it all
But it's time, oh it's time for me to shine
Hey, so it's 'bout time, oh it's time for me to shine

It's my time, said it's my time, for me to shine, oh oh oh
It's my time, it's 'bout time for me to shine

'Cause everybody laughs and everybody cries
Sure it could hurt you baby
But give it a little try
'Cause that's the thing about love

That's the thing about love
That's the thing about love
That's the thing about
That's the thing about love
