(Hook)
Trials and tribulations
Until the Lord comes back
It's gonna be that way
My life of trials and tribulations every day

[Boogy Nikke]
Now let me put you on game about this trial and tribulation situation
Gotta know how to pin it when you feel it
Close as ? to trial or the one and only
Nigga, let your heart be the jury
Keep it real when it ?, baby
You gotta know how to roll on situations
Good or bad, just like niggas because your eyes - they never lie
And tribulations to me, that's for my enemies bleed
When my pistol whip three-eighty, put the ?

(Hook)

[Mo! Hart]
Don't have to know someone
I claim to have faith
And yet and still doubt is standin' right in front of my face
Tonight, you showed me your life
Tomorrow, I can start to make right all my wrongs
Plus all the harm that I've caused
It's on - I had to realize quick
That there's a down side to this life shit
A lot of times I have tendencies to throw hellified fits
Sometime life gets a little bit hard
And I can say it's really left me kind of puzzled
Scarred (puzzled, scarred)

(Hook)

[Tony Tone]
Just look at my life and plenty situations that I go through
These trials and tribulations and they got me facin' all this evil
What to do? See much ? around me
And jealousy and envy don't make it no better
Playa haters, you ain't even on my level
Because I'm searchin' for peace
Don't let me harm thee
Why you wanna test and tempt a Hustla like me?
Even though we born in this world that's full sin, it's so easy to sin
The hardest part is not givin' in to the wicked ways of the demons' role play
Everyday is different, complication, so what's goin' on in this nation?
I guess that's life
My life, my life, my life of trials and tribulations

Until the Lord comes back
It's gonna be that way
My life of trials and tribulations every day
Trials and Tribulations
My life...
