[Verse 1]
Old boy at the bar with the stagger in his step
Looks like he's been rode hard and put up wet
Heartache's on him like stink on a skunk
He's fightin' off lonely, tryin' to drown it with a drunk

[Chorus]
Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops, or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock

[Verse 2]
Yeah, think he's still a little green, ya'll, he's fresh off the farm
Some pretty little thing put a whoopin' on his heart
He's walkin' to the left, leanin' to the right
Talkin' to himself, puttin' up a fight

[Chorus]
Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops, or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock

[Bridge]
He needs a long rope, boys, cut him some slack
Every now and then you gotta act like that

[Chorus]
Let the cowboy rock, let the good times roll
This is where the hurt stops, or where the whiskey flows
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock

[Outro]
Let him drink every drop, go, go, go 'til he drops
Let the cowboy rock
