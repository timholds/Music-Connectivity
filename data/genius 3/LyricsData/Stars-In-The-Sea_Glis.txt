The sky falls down
Outside my window
The world spins 'round
Oh it must get better

The sky falls down
It streams past my window
The calm resounds
Oh it must get better

The sky falls down
It streams past my window
The tide resounds
Oh it must get better

What heaven'd you fall from
What heaven'd you fall from
Falling down down down on me
Down down down on me

[We can get past it love
We can get past it love
We can get
We can get
We can get past it love]

Stars fall down on me
