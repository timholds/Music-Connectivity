[Verse 1]
My taxicab's waiting
Wish I could hold you one last time
After all we had together
There's gotta be a better way
Of telling you goodbye

[Chorus]
If I had a horse
I'd ride off in the sunset
If I had wings, I'd fly off
In the sky so blue
If I had the time, I'd spend my
Whole life dreaming
But I'd wake up, still in love with you

[Verse 2]
Be in Baton Rouge by morning
Hope your missing me by then
I'd like to be the kind of memory
That makes you want to take me back
In your arms again

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Some night when you get lonely
Will you still remember me

[Chorus]
