No need to hear your voice
Or see your face
To know that you are with me
No need to kiss your lips
Or hold your hand
To know that you can feel me
I know that you can feel me

When I look to the stars
I know just where you are
You're looking down upon me
(You're looking down upon me)
When I look to the stars
I know just where you are
You're looking down upon me
(You're looking down upon me)

No need to get locked up
Inside the past
I know that isn't changing
No need to let you go
Or say goodbye
I know that you'll be waiting
I know that you'll be waiting

When I look to the stars
I know just where you are
You're looking down upon me
(You're looking down upon me)
When I look to the stars
I know just where you are
You're looking down upon me
(You're looking down upon me)
On the other side!
On the other side!

I've got to
Find a way
To keep my pain from burning
Down to the bone
I've got to
Find a way!
To keep my pain from burning!
Down to the bone!
Down to the bone!

When I look to the stars
I know just where you are
You're looking down upon me
(You're looking down upon me)
When I look to the stars
I know just where you are
You're looking down upon me
(You're looking down upon me)
