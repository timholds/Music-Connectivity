This time , I'm coming home
I gotta say I'm sorry
She was my one mistake
The last one I'll ever make
I broke you down
I told you lies
And in my way I made you love me
And through it all , there's gotta be
We go through those changes with

One love is better than many
Who cares what magic dream
There might have been
I'm lonely for one love
I live without any
Your love , the dream 
Make it real

This time , I'm someone else
I'm not the one who hurt you
You are my destiny
The love light inside of me
And who am I , if not for you
An empty soul with no tomorrow
Smiling eyes or starless skies
We go through those changes with

One love is better than many
Who cares what magic dream
There might have been
I'm lonely for one love
I live without any
Your love , the dream 
Make it real

Just give me
One love is better than many
