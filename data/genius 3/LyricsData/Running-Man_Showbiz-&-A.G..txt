[A.G.]
Homicide came by 3 times this week (3 times)
Consider me mute cause a nigga won't speak (nope)
They said they wanna talk, just got a few questions
Yeah right, I'm from the street, and I learned a few lessons
So upjump the boogie, grab the weed and some cookies
Not the kind you bake, the kind you make to triple up your profits (let's go)
I been a product of my hood since Spofford
Held down the projects, ain't the nigga to box with
But every knock at the door is stressin' me out (Why?)
Cause when they catch me they not lettin' me out
My baby mama said they had photos and documents
Witnesses say I'm the shooter like Stojakovic
And I was wit a man, they said I killed a man
Will the jury have reasonable doubt?
I ain't Jigga man
And the TV keep callin' me a monster
With no morals, If they only knew I did it for honor

[Hook]
(So)
Life is hard when a nigga on the run
Can't eat, no sleep, on the low, no fun (no fun)
Shit is real when a nigga on the run
So (so) run mufucka, run mufucka (Run, run)[Rev run]

So now it's me and my bitch, my ride and my pistol
It's always a chick that ride or die with you
They say I'm deadly with a toaster
Can't grind like I'm supposed to
With my face on a poster
Lookin' over my shoulder

Every time they talk they relivin' the moment
And your peeps'll rat you out for a bonus
Hurt, don't it?
I love my baby mama they might run in there
Or maybe not, cause the cops keep comin' there (Run, run)
And the families of the victim solemnly swore revenge
Saw my homie at the light, caught him slippin' in his Benz (Damn)
No lovers (No lovers), just friends (Just friends)
I hit the skins now I'm gone with the wind (Run, run) (Yup)
And that's my law, if you sleep, you fall
Bitch might wanna call, take the reward
Just the son of man, at large with a gun in hand
A wanted man, so they call me a runnin' man

[Hook]
Life is hard when a nigga on the run
Can't eat, no sleep, on the low, no fun
Shit is real when a nigga on the run
So run mufucka, run mufucka (Run, run)

Life is hard when they got you on the run
Can't eat, no sleep, on the low, no fun
Shit is real when you livin' on the run
So run mufucka, run mufucka (Run, run)
