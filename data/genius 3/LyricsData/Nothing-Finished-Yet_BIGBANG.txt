Maybe I'm just waiting for the right time
To come along
Birds don't sing because they have answers
They sing because they have songs
Baby bay how could you forget?
Have not forgotten just not finished yet
So what have we got?
We got a lot of nothing finished yet
How could I forget
We are eiffel tower high
Shaky like a hollywood hillside
Norwegian winter long
Birds flying across the ocean
The dirty war is in our song
As true as any slip of your tongue
Some put on wetsuits others a wedding ring
No need to say anythingjust feel better
I'll be waiting I'm still wainting
Baby bay how could you forget?
Have not forgotten just not finished yet
And we know...
We got a lot of nothing finished yet
How could I forget
We are eiffel tower high
Shaky like a hollywood hillside
Norwegian winter long
Birds flying across the ocean
The dirty war is in our song
As true as any slip of your tongue
