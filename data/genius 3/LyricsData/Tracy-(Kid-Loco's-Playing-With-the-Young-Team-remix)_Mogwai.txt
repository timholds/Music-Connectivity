We gotta, we gotta do something about this
When do you think you could make it over here? How long?
I could try and get there... 25 minutes maybe
Right
I'll try
OK
But we got to sort this out
OK. I'm just gonna go. I'm going to head off just now and just try to speak to some people about this
Well, you gotta do something
Yeah
'Cause if we don't take care of this then... I don't even want to think about it

Hello?
Hi, Colin
Hiya
It's Martin
Hi, Martin
I'm sorry to bother you
It's alright
But we've got a bit of a sketch going on here
What? What?
Well, it's pretty hard to explain
So tell us. What?
Right. We were down at Vics... and Stuart and Dominic got into a bit of a row
Mhm
And Stuart was getting a bit stroppy with Dominic and it ended up with Dominic punching Stuart and walking out
Mhm
Saying he's not coming back. Stuart's saying that he's out... and stuff like that
Right
Stuart's away as well
Where's Stuart away to?
He just phoned his dad and left
And is John still there?
No, he went away with Stuart for some reason. To try and calm him down or something. It was a full bloody sketch, man. I don't know what to do. We've this thing on Tuesday
Right. Kind of limited to what I can do, right?
Yeah
