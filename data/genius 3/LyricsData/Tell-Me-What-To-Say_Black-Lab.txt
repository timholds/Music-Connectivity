Tell me what to say
And I will say it to you

I take one for the heartbreak
One for the headache
Two for the constant tears
I take one for the blindness
One for the foolishness
Trying to keep you here

I would stop waiting
Stop crying
Stop breathing in, too
While you stay away so long

I would stop calling
Stop writing
Stop faking
Stop denying you're as good as gone
But I dunno

So you just tell me what to say
And I will say it to you
I would do it for you
I would burn this house down

Tell me what to say
And I will say it to you
I would do what you do
I would burn us to the ground

Even on weekdays
Even on Sunday
Even in the blackest nights
Even when you touch me
I know you don't love me
And, uh, can't make it right

I would stop waiting
Stop walking
Stop trying to start you talking
Or say your old goodbyes

I would stop drinking
Stop feeling
Break down and start believing
You might change your mind
Well, I dunno

So you just tell me what to say
And I will say it to you
I would do it for you
I would burn this house down
Tell me what to say
And I will say it to you
I would do what you do
I would burn us to the ground

Hey, well, I dunno
So you just tell me what to say
And I'll say it to you
I would do it for you
I would burn this house down

Tell me what to say
And I will say it to you
I would do it for you
I would burn us to the ground
