You just call out my name, and you know where ever I am
I'll come running, running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall, honey
All you got to do is call and I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend

When you're down and troubled and you need some love care
And nothing . No, nothing is going right
Close your eyes and think of me and soon I will be there
To brighten up even your darkest nights

You just call out my name, and you know where ever I am
I'll come running, running to see you again
Winter, spring, summer, or fall, baby
All you got to do is call and I'll be there
You've got a friend
