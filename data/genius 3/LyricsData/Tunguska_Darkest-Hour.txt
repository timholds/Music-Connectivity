[Verse 1]
On the threshold of life as we know
In a chasm cascading to the core
Where nothing seems real anymore
In between the obtuse and obscene

[Chorus]
So let the rains come down and explore
The possibility that it all ended that day
And like all you dark clouds you skeptics
Denying your true nature, look away

[Verse 2]
Past the concrete and the steel
Flowing down to the valley below
Drawn out for 99 years
Splitting the seas
This terrestrial being

[Chorus]
So let the rains come down and explore
The possibility that it all ended that day
And like all you dark clouds you skeptics
Denying your true nature, look away

So let the rains come down
Well let the dark clouds gather around

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Dormant beneath us, what was will be
Dwelling within us, what is will be no more
No more

And maybe it's not all what we built it up to be
Sustaining scientific prophecy
