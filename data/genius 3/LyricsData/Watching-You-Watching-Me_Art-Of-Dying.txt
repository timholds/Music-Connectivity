I'm watching you sleep and are you awake anymore
Can you hear me are you dreaming
And hand out of reach truly impatient like the flower
Do you see me through the reeling
How will I fall with all your conditions at my feet
How will I know it’s okay
I am watching you watching me
And healing with time is like watching paint dry
Or March rains wash away all the feeling
Is seeing believing
How will I fall with all your conditions at my feet
How will I know it’s okay
How will I fare with towering expectations over me
How will I know it’s too late
I am watching you watching me
I never knew I would find you
I never knew I would have to let somebody in
How can something so easy be so hard
