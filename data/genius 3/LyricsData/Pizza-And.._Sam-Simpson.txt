Loosely handling looseys lucid dreaming til I'm loopy loony
Follow the truth loosely cooky truly too beast
On my two feet swinging toolies to abuse beats
Got y'all bumping toxic like camel clutch
Camping outside abrego house get you camera's up
New York area faggots get your cannons up
Stamina stammered up the ladder madder matador rapper move work from here to panama
My purpose on this earth to pick earth pick on earthlings cuz I'm perfect person perverted
She swallow me 100 percent  my cock worth money
Lil Ceasars and pornography racking my brain constantly
Bout to cop a piece cuz we never copping peace copper left a copper in piece
I put 2 in between this ho take her home smash hoping I don't cop the cs
What a day kid a spitting arrays of verbs more verses than the Analects way
What to say thoughts clouded by pax vapes
Out for more loot to collect put two in your vest get gratuitous sex best protect your head stick out your neck like a car pet just another step
To get preyed on those I hate on get embraced with napalm
Slapped up like a nigga got 8 arms
Your drive Paul Walker all authors awestruck came through awkward
Turned down all offers unimportant emcees think they attacking my fortress
Cunning man I'm snapping like the rubber band
On my hundred grand sonning niggas like the rubber banned
What don't you understand
Rolling papers while bumping ben folds
Yesterday sticky playboys today my girl the centerfold
Date her take her home statistics show
I could buy os for all these niggas too cuz my bullets stay in foes
Stay low we coming for your neck your check respect
We exert tecs to help cuz it foul out bro
Put niggas to sleep get with bucks like those
Other niggas reverse debts big as Wallace
Compute the cream and repair my wallets
Booking shows my feelings want me to wall it
Come through the kid's place with a thizz face
Blue dream in the suitcase yelling til I'm blue faced
