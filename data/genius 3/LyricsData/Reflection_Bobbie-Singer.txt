Song - Contest`99:
AUSTRIA
Performed by Bobbie Singer
Written by Dave Moskin
When I'm sad
I need a shoulder to cry on
And when I'm bad
You know that I am better
When you're gone
You're the one that I am thinking of
And when I come
It's to you that I run
There's no need to be lonely
I'll be there every time for you
Isn't that the way it's supposed to be
Sometimes memories will have to do
Don't you recognise me
I'm the one that you have seen
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
They say it's long way to heaven
But they are wrong
'cause heaven is you
And if I fall
From grace everlasting
There you are to make everything new
And we can fly forever
Wrap yourself around my emotions
We can only make it better and better
Don't ever think to doubt my devotions
Don't you recognise me
I'm the one that you have seen
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
Don't you recognise me
I'm the one that you have seen
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
The reflection in your eyes
