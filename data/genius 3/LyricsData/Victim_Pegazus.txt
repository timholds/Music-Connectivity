Darkness shining through
Blinding my eyes, stealing my soul
This cannot be true
It's not my time, not my goal
Reaper stalking me
Stealing my sleep, then running away
Lost reality
This world you can keep, I'm leaving today

Falling into another day of despair
Calling, I know I'll have to pay a certain price

Problems weighing down
Into the night, hear me scream
World keeps spinning round
No assistance at all, a demented dream
Demons distribute pain
Extracting a price, my reality
Victim of disdain
My heart turning black, please set me free

Falling into another day of despair
Calling, I know I'll have to pay a certain price

Victim, of a neurotic world
Victim, nowhere to hide
Victim, got to get out of here
Victim, it's time to die

Darkness shining through
Blinding my eyes, stealing my soul
This cannot be true
It's not my time, not my goal
Reaper stalking me
Stealing my sleep, then running away
Lost reality
This world you can keep, I'm leaving today

Falling into another day of despair
Calling, I know I'll have to pay a certain price

Victim, of a neurotic world
Victim, nowhere to hide
Victim, got to get out of here
Victim, it's time to die
