[Intro: KAMAU]
Good Lord
What you don't say, what you don't
I did it just for you
I did it just for you
I did it just for you
And you just don't care
(YEBO)

[Verse 1: KAMAU]
All them other dudes by your side
You can let them ride off to the sunset
I'm a sunrise
Why don't you want to collabo-llaborate? (Hey!)
Even though I make mistakes, oh yeah
I'm not a bad guy
I ain't all put together
But if you stick around
You gon' see I'm getting better and

[Chorus: KAMAU]
I did it just for you
I did it just for you
I did it just for you
And you just don't care
I did it just for you
I did it just for you
I did it just for you
And you just don't care

[Verse 2: KAMAU]
Mmm this could be a Cinderella story for a fella
If you let a brother come and spend a minute
With you only got a penny and I got from my loafers
Bet if I got something worth a penny, I can invest and
I'd be the best investment you've ever made
I'm invested but you don't care
It's interesting that you don't care
But you care about some less interesting guys
Those guys are wack (Wack!)
Just bring it back
Bring it back to me cause

[Chorus: KAMAU]

[Bridge: KAMAU]
Get that drank (Get that drank!)
In your cup (In your cup!)
Sip that drank (Sip that drank!)
Lift it up (Lift it up!)
Point your fingers (Point your fingers!)
At your boo (At your boo!)
Say 'baby I did it' (Baby I did it!)
Just for you (Just for you!)

[Verse 3: No Wyld]
If you got a minute can you spend it on me? (On me, on me)
Gotta get in 'fore I blow up and I got moneys
Cause you know I'm gon' get it (Gon' get it, gon' get it!)
Yeah, you know I'm gon' get it (Gon' get it, gon' get it!)
Come get it, don't sweat it, celebrate, confetti
Show me love when you're ready
'Til then I'll be chillin'
Speak cause you know I can't read my ions
Can't spend more time unless I [?]
Gotta wait for the stars to realign
You said 'it's all about time'
Girl, I just got signed
Why you gotta be all you, all you?
Soon it's gonna be all me, all me
You gon' see that it's too late and
You gon' say 'I wish we dated'
But I love you so I'm waitin', stop!
Procrastinatin', start appreciatin'
It's not too late

[Chorus: KAMAU]

[Break: KAMAU]
Baby, I did it (Baby, I did it)
Just for you (Just for you)
Baby, I did it (Baby, I did it)
Just for you (Just for you)
Did it, did it (Did it, did it)
Just for you (Just for you)
Did it, did it (Did it, did it)
Just for you (Just for you)

[Chorus: KAMAU]
