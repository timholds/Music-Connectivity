[Verse 1]
I don't want let it pass it through the
Pressure in my head
I don't wanna marinade in it (in it)
Again and again
And if I let it in to me
I get a rod in there
And its gonna ring through me
Again and again

[Refrain]
Half of me is melting away
Half of me never goes away

[Verse 2]
Wanna show you the new me
Show you I'm still here
Gonna let it ring through me cause I know you hear
I know you hear

[Refrain]
Half of me is melting away
Half of me never goes away
Away
Half of me is melting away
Half of me never goes away
Away

[Bridge]
Look at you
Just you with me
Sliding by just to the side
Oh, and its right
Our love's inside
Sliding by just to the side

[Refrain]
Half of me is melting away
Half of me never goes away
Away
Half of me is melting away
Half of me never goes away
Away
