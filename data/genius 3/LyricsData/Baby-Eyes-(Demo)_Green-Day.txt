Year of the rat, last of the litter
Somebody shot the babysitter!
They say my middle name is danger
The kind you keep away from strangers

I say woah!
I'm out of control!
Oh baby when i see your pretty face
I say woah!
God rest your fucking soul!
'cause baby, baby i was born to kill!

I pulled the trigger from the shooting stars
I am the motor in your crashing car!
I am the cherub in the Arab spring
I am the bullet in your magazine

I say woah!
I'm out of control!
Oh baby when i see your pretty face
I say woah!
God rest your fucking soul!
'cause baby, baby eyes
Oh baby eyes
Well baby I was born to...kill!
