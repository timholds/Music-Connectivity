Intro

Chorus:

(love) they want to take from your heart
(lies) they´ been lying from the start
(drugs) my neighborhood is unsafe
(spies) they´ recordin´ what you say
???
(eyes) and they watch you from the sky
(guns) and they be killin´ over ones
(why) because the devil is alive
(rise)

Verse 1:
Let my mind take over
How I´m gonna act like my mind ain´t older?
Try´n to be a better man, make a new folder
How we gon´ fail wit´ a god on our shoulder?
How is it? the child gifted
The way he make the music and my style fit it
Huh, so how is it the style isn´t
Exposed to the masses? we now fix it
Left my wallet in el segundo
But I ain´ really care, I ain´ got no ones though
I´m knockin´ the front door
I used to practice in the mirror but ain´t no one know
I was never all alone
They watched me in the mirror and they listened to my phone
I hear it in the tone: they spyin´ on me
Sometimes I be funny and i leave that shit on roam
