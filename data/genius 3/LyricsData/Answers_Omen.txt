[Hook: Ari Lourdes]
Searching for you, searching for you

[Verse 1: Omen]
For so many years, I've been struggling, fighting this battle
Searching out for my enemy as he hides in the shadows
Poisons me, cloud my vision, can't keep my eyes on the sparrow
Mama been telling me since I was young that I was a pharaoh
But I feel like a slave, so isolated and caged
Inside, I fill up with rage, I'd rather pull out the gage
I'm so passive aggressive, wish I was half as expressive as all of my peers
But I'm lost in my fear, Oh Lord
I'm sick of playing the victim, sick of blaming the system
Sick of dreaming, debating, hoping, waiting, and wishing for things to change
Waiting for perfect, perfect never came
Me and my enemy the same in the mirror
We all the same in the mirror
Can't hide your pain in the mirror
Enemy came in the mirror, and I was calling for help

[Hook: Ari Lourdes]
Is there a God? If there is, I'm calling searching for you
Is there a God? If there is, I'm calling searching for you

[Verse 2: Omen]
As I stare into this mirror, my eyes illuminated
Cause for the first time, I see who I was truly hating
All of this time, you wasn't hiding from me
You was laughing in my face, what was I becoming?
I see the truth shown, I see the roof's gone
And I done learned that what I reap sown
I see the wolf inside the sheep's clothes
All of this time that I was blaming her, blaming him, blame the devil, blame my kin
All this time I'm blaming them, and so easily never taken responsibility
Looking inside my enemy, finally found the enemy in the mirror
Looking inside the mirror, images getting clearer
Mental is getting purer, I feel the change in my attitude
For everybody I blamed, now there is gratitude
Loving what I see in this mirror, smiling back at you
That procrastination before gave me battle wounds
But now I'm back in tune

[Hook: Ari Lourdes]
Is there a God? If there is, I'm calling searching for you
Is there a God? If there is, I'm calling searching for you

[Omen]
Only I can stop my dreams
My only enemy is myself
I look to the sky and I scream
More than ever need God's help
Only I can stop my dreams
My only enemy is myself
I look to the sky and I scream

[Verse 3: Omen]
My childhood was wholesome, but somehow I became lonesome
And I was longing for something more
But something more don't just show up at your door
Didn't wanna hustle for it, my desire premature
But the struggle made me desire more
So my desire poured out my pores
I was all for it, and I was asking God for help
God said I had the power within myself

[Hook: Ari Lourdes]
Searching for you, searching for you
Searching for you, searching for you
Searching for you, searching for you
