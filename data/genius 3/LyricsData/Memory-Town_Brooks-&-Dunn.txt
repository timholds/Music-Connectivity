[Verse 1]
There's a house down on the corner with the porch light on
And a window I can look in and see you're always home
Waiting for me with the lights low in your silk night gown
Somewhere on the outskirts of memory town
Past the stop-light there's a desert where my Coupe Deville
Roars down a lonely highway and it always will
The wind is in your hair and we're nowhere to be found
Two spirits on the boulevard of memory town

[Chorus]
I can pull the shades and feel your lips they're touching mine again
I can watch the shadows of the moon slow dance across your skin
Hold you in a place where lovers never say goodbye
Every moment comes alive, when I go down to memory town

[Verse 2]
Round the corner there's an ocean where the waves roll in
And a feeling that you only feel when love begins
We lie together in the sand and watch the sun go down
I close my eyes and smell the warm salt air in memory town

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
There's a house down on the corner with the porch light on
A window I can look and see you're always home
Waiting for me with the light low in your silk night gown
Somewhere on the outskirts of memory town

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Take me down
To memory town
