Wasted away, no time to kill
Or be the owner of things
So swept away, by modern toys
Man finds no time to kill, honestly

By the light of my lantern sigh, saturnine
I and I caution, i'm so old
I lean on a shoulder so low
I trip on shadows of oceans and echoes
Solidified, a man alone
Lost hearts can fall so low
Stripped down, spit out
Now all I have is my honesty, honestly

Chipped this stone
Cloaked this face
Blessed being this cyclone saved
Self-sacrifice, these winds create
Drinking as if I'm starved for shame

By the light of my lantern sigh, saturnine
I and I, caution, i'm so old
I look for someone to cry to
Floating on thoughts of trapdoors and arrows
Criticized, I stand alone
Asking, please release these chains
Passed down, crashed out
I simply don't have the energy in me

Crucified, deified
Pulled apart so all can see
Bleed me, need me
Watch me wash away
I need the coldest hearts to start beating again
The ripple through the window warming me
Bleed me, need me
Watch me wash away
I need the coldest hearts to start beating again
The ripple through the window warming me
Bleed me need me
Watch me wash away

By the light of my lantern sigh, saturnine
I and I, caution, i'm so cold
I look for someone to cling to
And find myself trying to catch my own shadow
Solidified, a man alone
Lost hearts can fall so low
Stripped down, spit out
Now all I have is my honesty, honestly
Honesty, honestly, honesty
