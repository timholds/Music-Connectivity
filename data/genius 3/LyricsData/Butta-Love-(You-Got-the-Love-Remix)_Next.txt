	Makin' divine for the mil'
	I hit Nairobi in the back of my bogies
	and her heels
	Territory, orgy, tell my dory my story
	tell Heather, might hunt her
	and I smoke like fuggle
	Passed a stage of acne
	Put that ass on Pappy
	Tell Janet she can jack me
	If she smack me
	Like I'm fresh outta Attica
	For Tera to compare it, tell I meet her in France
	So, hit a stance while I'm grabbin her
	Let me rub the nappy, dug out till' I'm thug out
	Pop that left, that right, that rock they but out

	Can you see me later? let me see yo' feet for real
	Mix your mouth with your fingers

	from yo' hittable thighs to your kissable feet

	Verse 1:	
	I came in the door, said it before

	CHORUS(x2):
	You've got the love that I want

	Discovered the right wisdom
	Cause' say that she tight fit em'
	Started out with just a night with em'
	No expro shit
	overwhelmed with her gold fit
	And show chips
	Flashy, nasty, elegant and classy
	Love the way she talk trashy
	Politic like embassy
	Bought our future, never judgin on the past be
	Now shore in
