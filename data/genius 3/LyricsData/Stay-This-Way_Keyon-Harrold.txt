Times like this, seem rehearsed
Times like this, shine like golden
Carry on i love you
Nights of bliss

And as time, unfolds into an illusion
The present is a memory
Just be still, and stay this way

Forever young, time is ecstacy
Most people search and never feel this way
But when i saw your face, i knew
I knew, that it was you
I offer you, my through and through
You save my heart, and make it new
An act of sacrifice, if i should go astray
You'll always know, you have my soul
Just like the wind plays with the flames
You mesmerise a foolish game
Be my only memories, just be still
And stay this way

Just be still, in the mist of this day ... place
When time dont matter
And our thoughts can just be scatters
We sail away in this beautiful serenade
And that bouquet you've thrown, never lands
Living the first day i touched your soul, over and over and over again
I promise to be gentle with these sutures to patch your heart
And calm that bruising from the past experiences of life
And that shade that dimmed your light
I hope you shine like the supernova in this zenith
If i could i would say this backwards to show you that i mean it
It mean i you show to backwards this say i could if zenith
You know what im trying to say
I just hope that when all the world leaves me be, that you choose to stay
And that we can rendezvous in paradise, if either of us pass away

Stay this way, stay this way, stay this way

And as time unfolds, into an illusion
Your presence is a memory
Just be still, and stay this way
