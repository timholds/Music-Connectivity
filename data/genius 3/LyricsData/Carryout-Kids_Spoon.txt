[Verse]
I was a carryout kid we lived another life
We knew the things that we did would somehow prove right
We lived for joyless love and god above and here in the room as it burned to a tomb and set the city alight
Flames ignite
But now I work everyday
I get things done
I check the gas in the tank go to the movies and to the bank and stay well hid
Aw carryout kids oh what we did
And that's right I couldn't read her the rights
I couldn't live the life x2
Aw no aw no my mathematical mind
Now I know now I know now I know the world of magazine life magazine life magazine life
Because I work everyday
I got to get things done
And I can't give myself a rest on the way to getting blessed for getting a nun done
But carryout kids we meant what we did

[Outro]
I know it wasn't polite setting the city alight
Now I know now I know I want to life the life I want to roam the rights
Now I know now I know I want to live the life
Now I know now I know now I know I want to live the life
