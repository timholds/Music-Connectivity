[Verse 1]
The sprinklers are coming on
It’s early morning
I’m thinking of a dream I had
While the lawn drinks the day ahead
In these places I can breathe
I feel highways, I hear the sea
And everything I've ever seen
In all the windows of the world come to visit me

I get sick, I get well
But am I ever better? I can never tell
I move papers, I straighten shelves
I move and straighten I refuse to fail
And I'm as happy as I am small
I look for reasons I call down the hall
All the good men in the world won today
And in one big bomb all the war on earth went away

[Chorus]
No white and blue or Senator Joe
No aim indian, no demonstration
No Mao Tse Tung or holy kingdom coming
Revolution of no one
No collective voice or salvation
No cry to the sky, just a low hum
No neighbors wife or television
Revolution of no one

[Verse 2]
I tell you you're pretty
Like it’s something you did
We move through the fog like cameras
In the cool grey days that mean summer’s coming
You sound so sure, be sure for the both of us
If you didn't hear me the first time what I said was
All the wars in the world were won today
And in one big bomb all the good men on earth went away

[Chorus]
No white and blue or Senator Joe
No aim indian, no demonstration
No Mao Tse Tung or holy kingdom coming
Revolution of no one
No collective voice or salvation
No cry to the sky, just a low hum
No neighbors wife or television
Revolution of no one
