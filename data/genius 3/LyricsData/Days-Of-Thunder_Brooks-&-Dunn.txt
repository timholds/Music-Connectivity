A lot of trucks lined up down by the lake
Drinkin beer on the back of the tailgate
Boys from the valley wanna start a fire
Hey baby what you wanna do tonight
The only fear a rebel heart knows
Nothing to do and anything goes

Looking back on those days of thunder
Shake my head and I have to wonder
How we ever made it through that
Every night your taking me back
Desert road and a restless wind
Ain't it good to feel that way again
Here we are the way we were
And those days of thunder

That ole Ford is sure fast on the draw
Out gunned the Chevys and out run the law
Out skirts of town looking down on the light
Waitin for some kind of lightening to strike
The cars and the bars and the songs we knew had changed
The fire burns the site of her still remains

Looking back on those days of thunder
Shake my head and I have to wonder
How we ever made it through that
Every night your taking me back
Desert road and a restless wind
Ain't it good to feel that way again
Here we are the way we were
And those days of thunder

Looking back on those days of thunder
Shake my head and I have to wonder
How we ever made it through that
Every night your taking me back
Desert road and a restless wind
Ain't it good to feel that way again
Here we are the way we were
And those days of thunder
Those days of thunder
