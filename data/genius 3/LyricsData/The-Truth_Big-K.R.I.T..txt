Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Grandma told me that
The truth is so plain to see, yeah yeah, she used to tell me that
The truth is so plain to see, I always felt like, the truth is so plain to see
I always felt like, the truth is so plain to see, you should of known that, cuz we spitting the truth and nothing else

[Straight bars: Big KRIT]

Wake up, nothing to do but get my cake up
Praying to my Savior hoping he ain't out favors
Grandma praying for the end Lord come and take us
Head buried so deep in the word that she don't pick her face up
I'm feeling just the same, the heat of hell on my soul
Wondering will it rain?
Prepared to do some dirt but never what they do for fame
Forever paralyzed cuz I've dealt with so much pain shit'll drive a man insane
A little off my rocker
I told my girl I felt like dying it didn't shock her
More like she related
That's why my song take care of momma was such her favorite
She had to leave the room once I played it
The weed and the pills and the drink medicate it
But Willie Hutch start singing, she can't take it
Her pain runs deep too deep for me to chase it
So I let her vent my anger on me cuz I can take it
Cry now smile later cuz this ain't forever
She finds comfort in my confidence but I know better
The devil is all around me in the form
Of ski mask pots and pans Glocks and mason jar
I'm scarred, never would've known it would be this hard
To be a righteous man, in the city of God
In awe, of all the lack of remorse for your brother man
Because you riding in a Porsche and I could understand
If you tried once before to lend a helping hand
And he rejected it with force but if he reaching out
And you deny him of a torch that was passed to you
How could he ever run his course?
And I was feeling like I might rob me a nigga
Cuz even hero's sometimes relate to the villains
Ain't nothing worse than being fed up with your living
Too broke to pay for your own fucking existence
Yeah the truth

The truth is so plain to see (X3)
