[Verse 1]
Left me crying in a gypsy's arms
That [?] mans don't own my charms
She leave me a fortune 'cause I was a fool
She had me cursing like a big old tool

[Chorus]
I ain't never coming back
Got my heart ready for attack
Baby you can't bring me back
'Cause I'm no fool for you

[Verse 2]
'Cause Daddy Longlegs crawl down my back
Psychedelics but a way [?]
My baby's fortune was a [?]
Buy a [?]

[Chorus]
