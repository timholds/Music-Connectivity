Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing?
Oh, I guess that I'm doing fine
It's been so long now
But it seems now, that it was only yesterday

Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away

How's your new love?
I hope that he's doing fine
I heard you told him
That you'd love him till the end of time
Now, that's the same thing that you told me
Seems like just the other day

Gee, ain't it funny, how time slips away

I got to go now
I guess I'll see you around
Don't know when though
Never know, when I'll be back in town
But remember, what I tell you
In time you're going to pay

And it's surprising, how time slips away
