Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's all right because I love the way you lie
I Love the way you lie
That ain't the whole story
I've been stuck with jobs no one else, would take before me
Cuz I had to
Debt was going up
1-800 numbers started to blow me up
I knew I had to make it
Without music in my life I'm naked and homeless
So if I'm down and hurt
Are you Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry (I'm not afraid to take a stand)
That's all right because I love the way you lie (Everybody come take my hand)
I Love the way you lie
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you love the way you lie
Lately I've been dealin with haters
And people sayin I'll never make it
But I'll just use it as fuel to my heart
To keep it beatin
No I'll never be the reason I'm not succeeding
Or will I ever sell out or settle less than I'm needin
Cuz I've been there before and I can be there again
If I don't work for more it'll happen again
And if I'm down and hurt
Are you Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's all right
Because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry (I'm not afraid to take a stand)
That's all right because I love the way you lie (Everybody come take my hand)
I Love the way you lie
We'll walk this road together, through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just let you know that, you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road...
Yeah I love the way you lie
Uhh
I'm not afraid not afraid not afraid not afraid
Just let me burn
