[Intro]
Aye, yuh, yuh
I just called you on ya
I just called you on ya cellphone
I just called you on ya cellphone, aye
Yuh, aye

[Hook]
I just called up on your cellphone, aye
I just checked up on your location then I saw you wasn't home, aye
Now I'm running out of breath just to make it home, aye
Now I'm running out of breath just to-
I'm steady calling to your cellphone
Asking "where you at?", aye
Girl you know I hate it when you leave, bring it back
Pray, I hope you bring your cellphone
Keep and play it fair, aye
Girl you know I hate it when you leave, bring it back

[Verse]
Aye, okay
See my life just an illusion
What we doing? What's the motive?
I just spent too many goddamn bands in my pants
Can't control me, now you know me
Girl now I'm going somewhere that you never knowin'
Hold it slowly, aye, damn
I'm the man in my city, baby girl
Yeah, you know me, went from thirty people shows
Now out the nation, world tour
Been like all around the globe
All these hoes say they adore me but I had to bring it back
Where's it at? Yeah, it's that
I probably had to relapse off the flat
It was that, now I'm off like no other
Motherfuck em' if they hating on my squad
Damn, they broke, we flexin' hundreds
I just pulled up in that ghost with the most
All that fuck shit, what's up shit
I'm all up in the function, what's up shit
Now you hit my line as if you were mine
Bitch, I'm dead ass shit
Never could I love you like no other
Never love a bitch
Never could I love you like no other
Never love a bitch

[Hook]
I just called up on your cellphone, aye
I just checked up on your location then I saw you wasn't home, aye
Now I'm running out of breath just to make it home, aye
Now I'm running out of breath just to-
I'm steady calling to your cellphone

Pray, I hope you bring your cellphone
