I fell for anything that seemed mysterious
I was obsessed with the piece that wouldn't fit
I felt so caught inside of you - we made a trap and we lived in it

You never cover up
You never make it hard to get close
Oh, what have you got me into?

Where’s the virtue in being bored again?
Do these cigarettes serve to keep our mouths in check?
Why are we here? Do you wanna leave?
When you roll your eyes can you tell me what do you see?

I wanted you cause you stood out from the rest, I wanted you cause you said you don’t belong here
That you could find a better place but I think there’s something wrong here

You never cover up
You never make it hard to get close
Oh, what have you got me into?
You never cover up
You’re only calm when you feel adored
Oh, what have you got me into?

Trap the things you are not meant to keep
Keep them far from all that they desire
You love it just because it’s out of reach, kept farther and higher
Throw it out when you’re used to it or set it on fire
I know what you want the world to see but aren’t you tired out?

I wanted you cause you stood out from the rest, I wanted you cause you said you don’t belong here
That you could find a better place but I think there’s something wrong here

You never cover up
You never make it hard to get close
Oh, what have you got me into?
You never cover up
You’re only calm when you feel adored
Oh, what have you got me into?
