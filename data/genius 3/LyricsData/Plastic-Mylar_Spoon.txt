[Verse 1]
Inside the wall, I wasn't sure
Way things turned-out was best they could be
I'm working today and yesterday
Still got some time and I can have some I've lived for

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, are you part of the motion-ment?
I want to be part of the movement too
I just don't find myself giving a fuck
About the things that I have to do when I see you

[Chorus]
Well, it'll get you like it's got me
It cuts my teeth and then it, like I said
When I first saw her, I thought I knew her
Now I know I don't just wish I did

[Verse 2]
And she could be able to take me far
So come over my house and say
Save my life, plastic mylar
I'm assuming you'll put me right
I'm assuming you're not a
And she's got a place that is cool so far
And I haven't seen her perfections
For my plastic mylar
I'm assuming you'll put me right
I'm assuming you're out of sight
To John, David and Sean and D
Rocky and Lou and Kim and her sister
And two jobs later, Jerry B
Ratour Magalinto, Marilyn Ruth

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And she could be able to take me far
So come over my house and say
Save my life, plastic mylar
I'm assuming you'll put me right
Well, I'm assuming you're out of
And she's got a place that is cool so far
And I haven't seen her perfections
For my plastic mylar
I'm assuming you'll put me right
I am assuming you're out of sight
