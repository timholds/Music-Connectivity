[Intro: Bob Marley - Wake up and Live]
Life is one big road with lots of signs
So when you riding through the ruts, don't complicate your mind


[Hook: Young Craw]
Oh Tell me why life seem fast
I'm just tryna take my foot off the gas
I'm just DUI driving tryna follow Gods plan Oh Oh
[3x]I'm just DUI driving
The rocky road apart of his plan

[Verse 1: Young Craw]
My mama got fuck my daddy got a nut
But it was crazy tho cause all I got was bad luck
Skin of of bronze hair like sheep's black wool
They cross a nigga but my spirit still full
Call me nigga but understand yall definition real dull
N.ever I.gnorant G.oal G.etting A.chiever oh
I feel like God I’m just leading my disciples
Got caught up with this shit cause I can be somebody grateful
Don’t fuck with Judas cause he slicky slimmey play it raw
Real greedy so I’m doubt him like Thomas dawg
I try to tell’em the truth but the crucify me
Son of God so in the end they all gone feel me
When I'm dead and gone 300 yeah they go remember D
Who always played for keeps cause I'm a young prodigy
Man I swear that I use to wanna be so tough
Until I learnt keeping it real with yourself is enough
Yeahhhh, And I got problems the size of California
Some it make you wanna ride dirty don't it
They say the rocky road apart of his god damn plan
I drink hen and blow weed to keep from going insane

[Hook]


Excuse me for doing what I was taught not doing what the hell I don't know
Just feed your brain either way it go
Sense a lil boy I always knew I had it coming
Moral of the story you could come from nothing and  have something
Aye hold up we all got the same 24 hours dawg
Will you use yours or abuse your and in up losted
Nigga get in the whip and talking bout they hot boxing
Cause it been a long week and the devil wannabe the hot topic
But I don't listen pay attention and trying not to swerve
You could ride with the devil and in up on the curve
Mix the brown with the white chase it with real and fake I guess I'm DUI tonight with gods faith

[Hook]

[Outro: Bob Marley - Wake up and Live]
Life is one big road with lots of signs
So when you riding through the ruts, don't complicate your mind
