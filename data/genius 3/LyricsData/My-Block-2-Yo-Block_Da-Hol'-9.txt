[Hook: 1-Kemo  2- Kaos]
1- From my block to yo block
I'm on that Eastside
2- Who is heard or what about them
On the Eastsiiiiiiiiide
1- From my block to yo block
I'm on that Westside
We're undercovers wit them bulletproof vests right
From my block to yo block
I'm on that Southside
Derty expecting bout a g string on his mouth now
From my block to yo block
I'm on that Northside
Where them gorillas thurl wig-splitters let them sparks fly

[Verse 1: Kemo]
Kemo STL wit a little man bustin off his adrenaline rush
Take it to the eastside ATL, that's the only sets where they protect they guts
And they snuffed in dust, when we're takin them cats to where your bone busted rest
For the sufferin season, whole 9 represent for the region
Like American legion, bein up every weekend
Somebody tell me the reason birds postin fly south for the weekend but
Instead they comin from Alabama to Cleveland
For my ducks to the beacon, homes sparkin up like Cheech and Chong
Hit the west, smoke some of that ses you'll probably pass out when it reach your dome
In the 6-1-9, and the 3-1-0, and the 8-1-8
That's San Diego, Compton and Pasadena make no mistakes
When you in they hood, they let 'em burn, they throwin them thangs
They ain't no good, they smokin on sherm, they claimin the game
I take it on back to the midwest wit my gang, wit the money in sets that came
I lay my head in the EstroVoud Strech just to rest my brain

[Bridge: Kaos]
They speedin, left speakers rollin up to the spot
And we do it like you do it in St. Louis, its hot

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kaos]
This for them ballas and thugs sittin on them dubs
Slangin Nap Boy and Girl in Pittsburgh back down in Florida
My dertys copped them pounds in H-Town
In Birmingham, Oklahoma, Chi-Town and Orange Mount
Split Clairdale all day, and in M.L.K. where we roll
70 down town, Jackson, Columbus, Charlotte, Dayton, Memphis, Repo
There's too much traffic in Dallas and Nashville
The ones who keepin them humps in they trunk, rollin up them blunts in Jacksonville
What about P.R.E., Louisville, Wichita, Springfield
Montgomery, Gainesville, Little Rock and Greensville
Baton Rouge, Lafayette, KC, Miami and New York
D.C., Mississippi, New Orleans, Phoenix and Detroit
Philly, Milwaukee, Atlanta
Charleston, Columbia, Savanna
Puerto Rico, Carolina, Plain Rolley, Orlando, Tampa
Can't forget about Nasty Nani, South Bin, Mobile and Cali
Urbody in that valley and urbody in that piece like Oww
Now where you at? (NORTHSIDE!)
Where you at? (SOUTHSIDE!)
Where you at? (EASTSIDE!)
Where you at? (WESTSIDE!)

[Bridge: Kaos]
They speedin, left speakers rollin up to the spot
And we do it like you do it in St. Louis, its hot
