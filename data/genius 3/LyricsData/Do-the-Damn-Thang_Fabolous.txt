Look
I Can See Da Niggas Stuntin to dis right now
Not Now
But Right Now Yea yea chea
Look Look Look

Its no love for the other side fuck those tricks
Pop a glove on the side and buck them pricks
Birds love how brother truck lean sick
I been one of them boys since way back when
This was way before a nigga brought weight packs in
So if I spray mac 10's
Bet you niggas lay back like you in the Maybach Benz
Yea I make crack grands
But ain't a damn thing funny
I keep a pocket full to do the damn thing money
I keep it comin wit bottles of champagne honey
So keep it bouncin till you pull a hamstring honey
This pimps betta have a doctor for me
I got them tricks standin like dey gotta problem wit me
I got them boys slangin rocks in the lobby for me
I'm rich bitch, ballin just a hobby for me

[Hook]
Gotta Pocket full of money

We can't hide the money here

Nigga Matter fact I ain't fat joe but I can make 'em lean back
Save your ammo dont waste it
