It was a cold black night
When my mama passed away
It was a cold black night
When my mama passed away
Now I'm all right
Remember the cold black night
It was a green great day
When my papa passed away
It was a green great day
When my papa passed away
But I'm all right
On this cold great day
It was a cold black night
When my mama passed away
It was a cold black night
Now I'm all right
But my mama has passed away
