[Verse 1: Dels]
Brick upon brick, the city’s getting taller
Public space gets smaller, violate the order
Sonic acrobatics, watch me flip the beat, slaughter
Dragging both feet in the rain, street stalker
Reporting live from the 149...
Where drunk heads are slurring, muttering lies
Sirens, a logo for crime
Red and blue lights spin away in the night
My heart whispers “You Love I”
And the hands on my watch spin back, no lie
I tumble down the stairs in reverse, take flight
Then the fair drops back in her purse, oh my
Raindrops go back to the clouds, in time
With this beat that’s stuck on my mind, Dark sky
Feeling upbeat, I’m sound, despite
Everything that’s bringing me down on this night

[Verse 2: Dels]
I’ve run out of shout, a fight breaks out
Chips exchanged for pounds
I step down in reverse on the pavement
Then the cigarette grows
Pondering life’s lows I scroll through my phone
A text goes back to it’s sender, I’m no longer vex
Even though I lost my wallet, dancing, moshing to Ghetts
Foreign feet scuff up the creps
As me and the boys lust the opposite sex
Garage tracks spin backwards, they sound abstract
As I retract the conversation that saps
Back into my lungs like Nicotine extract
They never found the baggie in my backpack
As I enter the bar for drunk laughs
I feel a nervous feeling that won't last, there’s no scars
We tumble down the path with no class
Getting smashed is the task, as our hearts ask...

[Verse 3: Dels]
Alone on the couch, a piano fills the background
London’s burning down, got the news on with no sound
Seeing dark images, the youth in revolt
They lost hope, long ago, throw ‘em rope
On the top floor disconnected from the City
On the balcony so the winds of change hit me
Holding onto railings like roller coaster handlebars
Looking at the stars gazing, heard my Nanna laugh
Second hand echoes sing praise to Allah
As I sip the bourbon and dip my brain in black matter
Back washing all my troubles in a tumbler
Mind is numbing up, my phones buzzing up
My boys calling me...
It’s Dean saying turn on the news
London’s on fire, covered in red hues
Inspired by Goddard, it starts with the ending
Spitting new wave the conclusion is pending
