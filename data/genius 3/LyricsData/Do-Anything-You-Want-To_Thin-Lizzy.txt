There are people that will investigate you
They'll insinuate, intimidate and complicate you
Don't ever wait or hesitate to
State the fate that awaits those who
Try to shake or take you
Don't let them break you

You can do anything you want to do
It's not wrong what I'm saying, it's true
You can do anything you want to do
Do what you want to

People that despise you
Will analyse then criticise you
They'll scandalise and tell lies until they realise you
Are somebody they should've apologised to
Don't let these people compromise you
Be wise to

You can do anything you want to do
It's not wrong what I'm saying, it's true
You can do anything you want to do
Do what you want to

Hey you
You're not that puppet on a string
You can do everything
It's true
If you really want to
You can do anything you want
Just like I do

You can do anything you want to do
It's not wrong what I'm saying, it's true
You can do anything you want to do
Do what you want to

Hey you
You can do
Hey you
Yes, you

Elvis is dead
The king of rock and roll is dead
Elvis is dead
