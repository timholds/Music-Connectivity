[Verse One]
Last chance for victory and I got it
I’m giving my all, every song, episodic
Been giving a chance, show me love, philanthropic
Got out of a daze, stepped away from the hypnotic
Like a patient, waiting for a surgeon
Give me back my life; I’m sick of being a burden, that’s for certain
Dark lyrics and stories, they tell you where I come from
I held back from winning, but now I want some
And it’s not a request it’s a demand
You’re hearing it now I’m telling you first hand
I feel like I’ve been judged by my pigment
They better let it go because I’m here and I’m staying, damn it, commitment

[Bridge:]
Ya’ll know I’mma do it
They know I’mma get it
It’s the league of champions, they told me I’m admitted
I’m destined to be different so I speak within the silence
Taking over the stage
Moment of vibrance

[Chorus:]
You hear the crowd screaming? (I took it all)
No longer in the clouds dreaming. (I took it all)
The stage is now home
I cleared out the space and now it’s called the zone
I’m taking it all
And it’s all for me (x3)
Ooh, I’m taking it all

[Verse Two:]
What’s better than this? You can’t find it
Think so? You’re misguided
I’m here so you’re reminded what a real man looks like
Instead of what you heard
I stand behind pride and the meaning of my words
When I step up on the stage it’s a party
I could be at Bradley, and still feel the energy of Milwaukee
Man of the hour, I’m ready to take it
Audience of fans that call me the fan favorite
I spent a year on a mixtape, who does that?
I feel like I lacked, so I had to make a comeback
Still, I’m active like Bill, Mr. Huxtable
(I’m not bragging, I’m comfortable)

[Bridge:]
Ya’ll know I’mma do it
They know I’mma get it
It’s the league of champions, they told me I’m admitted
I’m destined to be different so I speak within the silence
Taking over the stage
Moment of vibrance

[Chorus:]
You hear the crowd screaming? (I took it all)
No longer in the clouds dreaming. (I took it all)
The stage is now home
I cleared out the space and now it’s called the zone
I’m taking it all
And it’s all for me (x3)
Ooh, I’m taking it all

[Verse Three:]
It’s Jwill, and Indigo Breeze
Cold body, polar, like I live in cold trees
People say my lyrics are chill
But I might take over and call it over when I step into the light
Red-eyed, intelligent, I’m Mr. Incredible
How I take break & still sticking to the schedule?
I’ll always make it known that I need this
Coming for the throne, and when I take it I’mma seize it
