Think I'll just fall to pieces
If I don't find something else to do
This sadness never ceases
I'm still in love with you
My head, it keeps on reeling
It's got me in a crazy spin
Darling, darling, darling
Is this the end?
Still in love with you
They say time has a way of healing
Dries all the tears from your eyes
But darling it's this empty feeling
My heart can't disguise
After all that we've been through
I try my best but it's no use
I guess I'll keep on loving you
Is this the end?
Now that it's all over, woman
There's something I think you should know
Baby, baby, think it over
Just one more time before you go
Call on me baby
If there's anything I can do for you
Call on me baby
Help me see it through
I'm still in love with you
BBC Version:
By now you must be lonely
You've been busted once again
You haven't got a penny
And you're feeling at the end
Just call on me baby
If there's anything i can do for you
Just call on me baby
I'm going to help you see it through
I'm still in love with you
The sunny days have drifted
And it's getting oh so cold
Your spirit can't be lifted
And your body starts to fold
So don't you just sit there crying
'cause soon you're going to mend
Things won't be so bad now baby
Once you know that there's a friend
