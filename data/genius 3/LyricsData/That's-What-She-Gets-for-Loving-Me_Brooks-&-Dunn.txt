[Verse 1]
She said what she wants is a man to be faithful
A true heart somebody willing and able
To stay by her side through thick and thin
A tender touch every now and then
She's not hung up on fairy tales
Or some dream at the bottom of a wishing well
Fancy cars or diamond rings
What she wants most are the little things

[Chorus]
That's what she gets
That's what she gets
That's what she gets for loving me

[Verse 2]
At times I lay awake at night
Stare at her laying by my side
Knowing there in her heart as she sleeps
She can forever count on me

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Whatever turns her on
I'm here to do it
Till the day they write my name in stone
I'll live to prove it

[Chorus][x2]
