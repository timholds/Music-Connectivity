[Hook: Kano]
I﻿ put on for my city like Jeezy
If you ain't from here, go home, E.T
Certain man don't rep the city right
Leave the boy alone I'm just living life
So you can tell Westwood, bomb it
MistaJam wheel it
Target gunshot it up like sniper
Make the whole crowd flash lighter
And niggas going spaz again

[Verse 1: Kano]
I tell them
Pussy I'm the realist
Three-stripe Adidas
Don’t make me take it old skool on some RUN DMC shit
Pum pum, yeah nigga beat it
So wet make nigga a sea sick
Champion never been defeated
Money ain't a thang
Jay Z can appreciate

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Kano]
Everybody's like take em back to 95
Fuck that take em back to 99
1 year prior till I rhymed the mic
Original but everyone Wiley-fied
And I was on the hypest hype
Tempa T...ARMS
Beats... BOMBS
Eskimo...DANCE
De-Ja, Storming, Sharky Major
Akademiks tracksuit, shiny green Pradas
But trust me nobody harder nobody faster nobody smarter
Nobody fucking with the master flow didada nobody but carter
And who gotta beats pon hard drive Mikey bingo tell a man gala
Cause, them a just see money man an old school baller, Carlton Palmer

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Wiley]
Brain usage slow thinkers, amongst the fastest
I’m elusive, but I’m here amongst the masters
Sweet tooth so firstly I'll be munching afters
I do it full hearted, I ain’t down with halfers
You will lose your soul tryna copy artists
This ain't 2-4, so they the ain't the hardest
Them spitters are like furniture, they might need a varnish
Some are like salad without the garnish
I ain't gonna hoist them up like a harness
Leave em down
I’m a G, star, what am I gonna feed em now
(Why?) Said they were cool before
I said no then, I don’t believe em now, wanna talk like there’s a new G in town
I told em I see the c﻿ in clown
But I sure can't see a new G in town
And a whole decade of music consistent
That’s why I put the “c” in crown (crown)
I put the “c” in crown
Wanna test? Then you’ll see me around
No soundboy can test wid da barrin'
When I’m on a track no breezin around (around)
Still got a better street value, like 3Gs of the brown
Music is my first girl, but she don’t mind when I’m sleepin' around

[Verse 4: Wretch 32]
I remember when he had crackers, bulla bread
And mummy had to scrape cheddar
Now in December, I can make it mayweather
I tell her take a cheap shot like mayweather
And I ain't a cheap shot at mayweather
I told her bend down, I'm a straight fella
See I can get serious but I play better
You know me, I put on for my city
Cause they throw me dirty money and I turn it to Diddy
Clean as a whistle
Blowing through the ends
Traktor just bought wretch a Mercedes Benz
This verse ain't a threat
I'm ready for anything
This year I've been nominated for everything
Hence why I ain't giving out no wedding rings
You married music, nigga, I'm selling it
Now I take better trips
I'm on the beach with an ice cream seeing jellyfish

[Verse 5: Scorcher]
I put on for my pussy-clart city
No pussy can't see me
All these man are mini-me's
No pussy can't be me
Why? I rep my city right
Rest In Peace, Mike, carr, it's fucking Thriller time
Popping bottles like it's mother fucking Miller time
I don't chase bitches, I just get my lizzie right
My niggas really ride
I'm from a part of the city where there's a million crimes
Some of my dogs, them are killers but I'm just living life
P-manamanamana
Sit up on da riddim, I ride the words, yeah
When I'm on the fly then all the girls come
I'm old school jungle-ist
Roll with all the hustlers
I'm just here for music but
They just want the customers
Yeah
And I'm way too boasie, carr
My chain is a Dolci
And your babe says she knows me
I'm all about the boxers
Call me Shane Mosley
Scorcher couz, you're spazzin' out (kano)
K, tell 'em ???

[Hook]

'Ey yo Kan'
Oi tell 'em
Oi tell 'em
Oi tell 'em leave it to the big boys
Yo, you know, I'm talking like nine out of ten flows are nothing
I mean nothing
Blaow, blaow, blaow, blaow
