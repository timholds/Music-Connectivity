(feat. 3LW)

[3LW] Ohh.. hey Naughty..

[Treach]
Oh where's my kitty kat, where's my kitty kat at
Welcome to our party, sexy likkle shorties
"Written On Ya Kitten" lickin lime from my Bacardi
Rub it on my body, kiss and twist and barley
Ask the don dada to to dat song
While I ooh-ah, ooh-ah - how I do that so long?
On the DL real baby, swell a dub crazy
DJ rewind that Naughty with that 3L-Dub baby
I move simple, just as sooth mix'll move gentle
I give ya mother-mm-mm, goose pimples goose pimples
Ain't the last brother passed over
I be the bastard of the year, y'know that calf punchin back brother
N-A-U-G-H, T-Y, B-Y
Na-Na-Na, NATURE, not cause I hate ya
Master the matress, flip an' go backwards
One kiss on your cheek will make you backflip to Chadwick

[Chorus: 3LW]
It feels good to ya (good to ya)
Let me see how you rock wit it (rock wit it)
Ride the beat baby, drop wit it (drop wit it)
And don't worry bout a damn thang (and don't worry bout a damn thang)
It feels good to ya (good to ya)
Let me see how you rock wit it (rock wit it)
Do your thing, come close wit it (close wit it)
And don't worry bout a damn thing (and don't worry bout a damn thang)
Feels good..

[Vinnie]
(Naughty.. Naughty..) Hey.. ever since back in the day
From "O.P.P." down to "Hip Hop Hooray"
Who invented party anthems that ease stress away?
You got drama, never mind that
Naughty by Nature, 3L-Dub, all star tracks
We got that flavor that make your hands clap, toes tap
And crossin cultural and generation age gaps
Never can you fade that
We make your body like rock to this
Everybody's block party's gonna wop to this
So to the family here's another one
And all those haters who ain't thinkin we still havin fun
Better throw your towel in son
How many years have we proved we can do this?
How many people we inspired to pursue this?
Well if you wanna test the mental the truth is
Naughty by Nature makes that Feel Good music

[Chorus]
[Treach]
Dang, Dang, I don't wanna go
The party ain't a party if it ain't... Naughty
Body to body dance... Naughty
Oh lordie, its IIcon and Naughty
It's the groove move more of us hate, come on tour with us
IF everybody smiles it makes the whole day glorious
Sliiiide left, sliiiiide right
Throw your hands high - I know that's right!
Now I strong, we ride strong, double IIcons
Gonna stop hurtin better let bygones be bygones
Sliiiide left, sliiiiide right
Dance ya spine out, wind let me find out
Ooh-ah Ooh-ah, outdoor with indo'
Aiyyy-yo! Drop the keys out the window
We got the wally with my yardies we partyin
Cause, after the party its the after-party and..

[Chorus]
[3LW]
Feels good, feels good, baby clap your hands (Hey, Hey)
Feels good, feels good, baby clap your hands
Feels good, feels good, baby clap your hands (Hey, Hey)
Feels good, feels good, baby clap your hands
(Hey, don't worry bout a damn thang)

[Chorus: w/ variations]
