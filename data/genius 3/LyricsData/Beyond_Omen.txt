[Verse 1]
Follow me down the yellow brick to the project steps and the ghetto
Though my conscious slept in the Death Row
I was born here, left in a death hole
All of my friend are gone in the wind, tossed in the pen, lost, and they all live in sin
Robbing the kids slaughtered, offing their limbs, darkness is calling all of our kin
But hell is just so handsome
It touch 'em, then romance 'em
It bust 'em down and ask 'em if they like some private dancing
So many times I've tried to run away, but I can't outrun hell
It's here to stay, wish I had wings on my back to fly away
Had wings on my back to fly away

[Hook]
I just wanna fly away, far, so far
I just wanna fly away, far, so far
I just wanna fly, just wanna fly away
Just wanna fly away, just wanna fly away
I just wanna fly, just wanna fly away
Just wanna fly away, just wanna fly away

[Verse 2]
Living inside a broke household, mommy and my papa can't get along
So I live in a basement and sit alone
I hope y'all never see what I been shown
Everyday, striking her face, fighting away, screams in the night and the day
Ike-ing her face, go and get her knife and her mace
Sweet nine millimeters she be hiding in a safe
But she say he's so handsome, she love him
She romance him, she bust him down and ask him if he like some private dancing
So many times I've tried to run away, but I can't outrun hell
It's here to stay, wish I had wings on my back to fly away
Had wings on my back to fly away

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
For the beat of the drum, I'd sleep on the sun
Hold heat deep at the feet of the gun
Low key creep with the reaper of the numb
Your life and then I feast on the young
Twice, let it leap from my tongue
I'm a writer, no need for my lungs
For the Beatstreet and people in slums
I'mma go knee-deep in the beat and beyond

[Bridge]
In the beat and beyond, in the beat and beyond
In the beat and beyond, for the Beatstreet and the people in slums
In the beat and beyond, in the beat and beyond
In the beat and beyond, for the Beatstreet and the people in slums

[Hook]

[Outro]
I just wanna fly away
Somebody help me find some way to escape from the pain
I just wanna fly away
Somebody help me find some way to escape from the pain
I just wanna fly away, far, far, far, far, far
I just wanna fly away, far, far, far, far, far
