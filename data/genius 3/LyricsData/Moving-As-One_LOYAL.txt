[Intro]
So gather what you need and meet me by the ashes of the tree
So gather what you need and meet me by the ashes of the tree
So gather what you need and breathe
We’ll move as one
The paint they use to fool you in I use to smear across our face
We’ll move as one
The coins they made to hold you in, I'm out
We’ll move as one

[Chorus]
Closed eyes, instincts lead
Each touch, we’ll grow strong
Closed eyes, instincts lead
Each touch, we’ll grow strong
As long as we’re moving as one
Closed eyes, instincts lead
Each touch, we’ll grow strong
Closed eyes (find peace), instincts lead (with war)
Each touch(keep us), we’ll grow strong (awake)
As long as we’re moving as one
As long as we’re moving as one
Closed eyes, instincts lead
Each touch, we’ll grow strong
Closed eyes, instincts lead
Each touch, we’ll grow strong
Closed eyes (find peace), instincts lead (with war)
Each touch (keep us), we'll grow strong (awake)
Closed eyes (find peace), instincts lead (with war)
Each touch (keep us), we'll grow strong (awake)

[Chorus: Choir]
Closed eyes (find peace), instincts lead (with war)
Each touch (keep us), we'll grow strong (awake)
Closed eyes (find peace), instincts lead (with war)
Each touch (keep us), we'll grow strong (awake)
Closed eyes (find peace), instincts lead (with war)
Each touch (keep us)

[Bridge]
Our Heat
Our Heat
Our Heat
Keeps us through the night

Our Heat keeps us through the night
As long as we are moving as one
(Our Heat)
As long as we are moving as one
(Our Heat)
As long as we are moving as one
As long as we are moving as one
As long as we are moving as one
(Our Heat)
Keeps us through the night
(Our Heat)
As long as we are moving as one
As long as we are moving as one
As long as we are moving as one
