[Verse 1]
Looking at the clouds in the sky
Floating image in my mind
Land of beauty and land of peace
Now I wonder where this place is from
The evidence is everywhere
I start to run, now I'm scared
Strange beings all around
Come everyone to this place I've found

[Chorus]
I'm feeling psyched to be walking
I wonder why
All my joys could be open
No more cries

[Verse 2]
My eyes are clear and now I'm cured
Don't you wanna be for sure?
I know my rights I'm allowed to die
So I'd rather swap your different guise
It's in my head if you will find
Mother love from all mankind
You look above and then you shout
No other way to say your head is alright

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
