[Verse 1]
Waiting in a room
All dressed up and bound and gagged up to a chair
It's so unfair
I don't dare to move
For the pain she puts me through is what I need
So make it bleed

[Chorus]
I'm in distress, oh, mistress
I confess, so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please, don't make me beg
For blood, sex, and booze you give me

[Verse 2]
Some say I'm disturbed
It's what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned from a girl called "Kill"

My head is in the gutter
Thank you, sir, strike up another
Mandolin of discipline
Throw me to the dogs
Let them eat my flesh down to the wood
It feels so good

[Chorus]
I'm in distress, oh, mistress
I confess, so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please, don't make me beg
For blood, sex, and booze you give me

[Verse 2]
Some say I'm disturbed
It's what I deserve
Another lesson to be learned from a girl called "Kill"

[Chorus]
I'm in distress, oh, mistress
I confess, so do it one more time
These handcuffs are too tight, well
You know I will obey
So please, don't make me beg
For blood, sex, and booze you give me

I'll show you a real time!
