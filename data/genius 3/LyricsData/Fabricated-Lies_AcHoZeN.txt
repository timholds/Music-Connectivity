[Verse 1: RZA]
Allyo, life bring changes
Man lose, man gains it
The flame is lit a pure heart sustains it
Persecuted for the truth
God is no spook
From all attachments to life the wise man withdrew
Blessed be the child who has his own
The glance of a smile, the greatest charity known
They can never stop the light we bring
Or the love we bring
They can never stop the song we sing
From the darkness God comes
They genocide the older
Told lies to the young
Fed us poison to eat
Made us slaves to meat
Trapped in purgatory
They erased our whole story
With no chance of release
Here comes the two, two double deuce with the truth
Plus we got the books and the facts and the proof

[Verse 2: Shavo]
Scorn, since birth born
I mourn critical time told tales
Beyond political
Realize in truth, educate in youth
Unified, worldwide, manifest genocide
A million-plus souls
My past contains holes
Judgment day is here
For you the bell tolls
False pride, can’t hide anything
Strong words we swing
You can never stop the songs we sing
Bless you Abbot for the wisdom, loyalty you bring
Marches led by the wicked souls evicted
Removed, systematically ejected
Evidence ignored, withheld, undetected

[Verse 3: Kinetic 9]
Again, loot was the aim
For this group of people slain
Decimated more than half now
You do the math now
Systematic slaughters
Dispensed on mothers, fathers
Brothers, sister, cousins
Friends, sons, and daughters
Who are starved, beat, and raped
Commemorate on this date
Set in April 24th now
Who can relate to this word, genocide
A word that’s been described as
A race denied until this day confide
For the truth has been refuted
In the mind it resides
Of those executed
And we won’t let this ride
Of this immoral justice we have come to expose
Achozen are the people from the pits of hell who rose
They said there’d be no sequel
But here this story goes
And we have come to teach you
Hoping we reach you now
Immoral justice we have come to expose
Achozen are the people from the depths of hell who rose now
