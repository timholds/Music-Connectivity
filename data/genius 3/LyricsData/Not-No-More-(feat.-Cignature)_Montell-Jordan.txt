Can't, I can't babe

Why don't we just leave it alone
And go our separate ways?
For some reason we don't get along
I miss those yesterdays

I don't know why I love you so
Trying so hard not to let you go
Every time I say go
I walk back through the door

I can't live like this anymore
No broken promises anymore
I won't even wish anymore
Not no more, not no more

You say you're walking out the door
You confuse me every time
I wish you just stick to it
Stop playing with my mind

Let me go on with my life
'Cause all we do is fuss and fight
And then make up like it's alright
But baby, not tonight

I can't live like this anymore
No broken promises anymore
I won't even wish anymore
Not no more, not no more

No, no, no, no, no, no, no

We can't live like this
We break and then we make up
It's like we can't resist

See every time I walk away
I walk back in your life
When we say that that we're leaving
Don't believe it, why we can't decide?

I can't live like this anymore
No broken promises anymore
I won't even wish anymore
Not no more, not no more

Hold on, hold on baby
If you let go then I'll let go
We can't live like this anymore
If you let go then I'll let go
We can't live like this anymore

You let go and I'll let go
We can't live like this anymore
You let go and I'll let go
We can't live like this anymore

If you let go then I'll let go
We can't live like this anymore
If you let go then I'll let go
Can't live like this anymore
If you let go then I'll let go
We can't live like this anymore

Not no more, not no more
