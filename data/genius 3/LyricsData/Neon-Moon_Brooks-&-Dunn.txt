When the sun goes down
On my side of town
That lonesome feeling
Comes to my door
The whole world turns blue

There's a rundown bar
Cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two
Way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losing you

I spend most every night
Beneath the light
Of this neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for
The lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I think of two young lovers
Running wild and free
I close my eyes
And sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room

No telling how many tears
I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies
That I've lied
Telling my poor heart
She'll come back someday
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for
The lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

The jukebox plays on
Drink by drink
The words of every sad song
Seem to say what I think
This hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end

Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light
From a neon moon

If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for
The lonely
To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

To watch your broken dreams
Dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon
