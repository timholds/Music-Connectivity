This is going out to all my cheefers out there
My children of the corn worldwide
I know they got points in time ya'll life
And ya'll feel like the weight of the world is on your shoulders
And everything that could go wrong just go wrong
And just make it feel like uh..

I just wanna get high and smoke my life away
All I wanna do is smoke my life away
So I shield my mind, I see no other way
All I wanna do is smoke my life away

There's so much trouble going on in my life
I don't even know where to start
It's those trials and tribulations and they ain't nothing nice
It's enough to tear your soul apart
Ya'll in the, me and my woman had an argument
Then she turned and slapped me in my face
Ya'll hear me on, I don't know what the fuck is going on
But I guess it's just one of those days

I just wanna get high and smoke my life away
All I wanna do is smoke my life away
So I shield my mind, I see no other way
All I wanna do is smoke my life away

I like to get my hustle on day and night
Cause that's how I stack my dividends
Out on these streets it ain't no wrong or right
So in essence I ain't got no friends
That's why I live my life all by myself
Cause your friends will get you everytime
Yeah, when it comes to money everyman for himself
So I'm always in his state of mind

I just wanna get high and smoke my life away
All I wanna do is smoke my life away
So I shield my mind, I see no other way
All I wanna do is smoke my life away

Ahh yeah, all my niggas out there
Breathing buds to break it down, smoking and blow all night long
This for them times when you feel like
You gon' have to bust cap in a muthafucka
But it ain't even that fucka serious nigga
Just go around nigga, be ride in this
Just feel this shit
