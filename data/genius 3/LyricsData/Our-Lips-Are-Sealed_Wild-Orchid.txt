We've got a secret, but our lips are sealed
We've got a secret, but our lips are sealed

Can you hear them they talk about us
Telling lies, well that's no suprise
Can you see them, see right through them
They have no shield, no secrets to reveal

It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play-hey-hey-hey
Our lips are sealed

There's a weapon that we must use
In our defense, silence
When you look at them, look right through them
That's when they disappear, that's when we'll be feared

It doesn't matter what they say
In the jealous games people play-hey-hey-hey
Our lips are sealed
Pay no mind to what they say
'Cause it doesn't matter anyway-hey-hey-hey
Our lips are sealed

We've got a secret but
Our lips are sealed

Hush my darling, don't you cry
Silent angels-forget their lies

Can you hear them they talk about us
Tellin' lies, well that's no suprise
Can you see them, see right through them
They have no shield, no secrets to reveal
