[Verse 1-will.i.am]
This is that original, this has no identical
You can't hack my digital, future aboriginal
Get up off my genitals, I stay on that pinnacle
Kill you with my lyricals, call me verbal criminal
Send you to that clinical, subscribe use of chemicals
Audio and visual, can't see me - invisible
I'm old school like biblical, futuristic next le-vel
Never on that typical; will I stop? Oh never, no

[Hook-Fergie]
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won (now baby)

[Bridge 1-will.i.am]
Don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it
Now baby don't you stop it, stop it

[Verse 2-Apl.de.ap]
You could call me crazy man, everyday I'm partyin
You could find me at the club, poppin bottles minglin
Ladies dancin to the jam, actin naughty, man oh man
Got me in the mood again, afterparty partyin
Yeah I keep it happenin, takin shots whatever man
Party like a veteran, music is my medicine
You won't find me settlin, can't be stopped I'm steppin in
Keep it goin 'til the end, yeah that's right here we go again

[Verse 3-Taboo]
I'm that one that lights it up, we red hot like firetrucks
Burn that book cause that's whassup, tell that DJ turn it up
We droppin, that music, for people all around
Keep rockin, head knockin, cause they can't shut us down

[Bridge 2-will.i.am]
And ain't no stoppin, we gon' keep on rockin
Baby ain't no stoppin, you can not stop us now

[Hook-Fergie]
I ain't gonna stop until I'm done (don't stop it)
I ain't gonna quit until I've won (now baby)

[Bridge 1-will.i.am]
Don't you stop it, stop it

Now baby don't you stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it)
You can not stop us now

[Fergie]
