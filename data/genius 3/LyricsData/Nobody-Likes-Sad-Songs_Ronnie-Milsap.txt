You've seen the way I entertain a crowd
I use to pack 'em in for miles around
And I play the happy songs that made 'em smile
Why'd you want to go and change my style?

Nobody like sad songs, the ones about goodbyes
Songs about broken hearts with tears in your eyes
Nobody like sad songs, since you went away
Seems like sad songs are all I can play

The crowd gets restless and they drift away
Lately no one wants to hear me play
I tried to do the songs I use to do
Ah, but then I think of you

And nobody like sad songs, the ones about goodbyes
Songs about broken hearts with tears in your eyes
Nobody like sad songs, since you went away
Seems like sad songs are all I can play

The boss just told me, "Ronnie, things aren't going well"
Hes gonna let me go, I can tell
He said, "What happened son, you had it made
Why'd you change the way you played"

Cause, nobody like sad songs, the ones about goodbyes
Songs about broken hearts with tears in your eyes
Nobody like sad songs, since you went away
Seems like, seems like sad songs are all I can play

Nobody like sad songs, the ones about goodbyes
Songs about broken hearts with tears in your eyes
Nobody like sad songs, since you went away
And it seems like sad songs are all I can play

Nobody like sad songs, the ones about goodbyes
Songs about broken hearts
