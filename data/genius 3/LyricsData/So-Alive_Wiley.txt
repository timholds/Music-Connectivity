[Hook: Syleena Johnson]
I'm loving every minute
Loving every minute of this life
I feel so alive
I feel so alive

[Verse 1: Wiley]
Put the flag in the sign
Toast of my achievement
I'm turning on the music frequent
So far so good with the numbers and actions
Looking at the figures eastern
Within a hundred 40k in a week
That's the kind of form I was seekin
Bad luck for songs I was leaking
Now when I eat tell 'em all what I'm peeking
Done the under crown battle and beefing
Burn rays didn't get paid that's free chip
Now I have a tone and the roads look teeth in
Until I thank God that I been here
I ain't given up till I get there
On a beat 2 children and a dead chair
Came back made it I sat down I'm still Wiley
But I got kids now

[Hook: Syleena Johnson] (x2)

[Verse 2: Far East Movement]
Always on the grind no breaks in the 'lac
LA in a dash, pumpin that bass in the back
Lean back, can't believe where we at
Just yesterday, slanging cd's like crack on the streets like rats
Now rats wanna buy my cheese all good, you can eat the jag
I'm bumping my own shit
I still can't believe it
Been winning so hard
My stripes is bleeding my adidas
I'm living all out and I want you to feel it
From the paper to the speakers
To my prayers, Thank You, Jesus

[Hook: Far East Movement] (x2)

[Verse 3: Far East Movement]
Round the world then back again
More hits more chicks no accidents
You absent, no access
Here to speak as bleed when I might check
Mic check 1, 2
I bless the beat hot too
As uncle Snoop he was there too
On a world tour, where were you?
Every day I'm trucking promise I won't stop for nothing
My heart beat here like percussion
But I love it all or nothing
Poppin' dish with the wakers
See I went in with the Lakers
Put my dreams down a paper
But paper bring out the haters

[Hook: Far East Movement] (x2)
