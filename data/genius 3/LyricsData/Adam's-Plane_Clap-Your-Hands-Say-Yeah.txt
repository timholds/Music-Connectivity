When Adam's plane went down in Rome
I thought I was the last to see him
Standing all alone on the sidewalk
Maybe I was too young to know
Maybe I saw a bit of me in him
And in the strange wind whipping all around us
We began ordinary citizens
Washed up and so what?
Born late
Too late
God, it seems we've been stumbling a bit

When Adam's plane went down in France
I just covered up his body
I'll admit I didn't know what I was doing
Maybe I should have looked ahead
Or lived only for the moment
With a bit of red wine
He stumbled in to meet me
Who am I to complain?
Washed up and so what?
Born late
Too late
God, it seems we've been stumbling a bit
But Adam says, "I'm fine."

When Adam's plane went down in Oklahoma
I had nearly forgotten all about him
There was no blood
He had no holes cut through him
Still I looked away
Let me try to explain
He's still alive and he's haunting me
We may end caged animals
God, it seems we've been stumbling a bit
But Adam says, "I'm fine."

In a way, we looked over our shoulders
In a way, made it hard for ourselves
In the sky is a bird that considers
Where to fly and nobody else
In a way, we were old to begin with
In a way, made it hard for ourselves
In the sky is a bird that considers
Where to fly and nobody else
