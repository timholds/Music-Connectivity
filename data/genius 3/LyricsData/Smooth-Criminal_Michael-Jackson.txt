[Verse 1]
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

[Break]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom

[Break]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Bridge]
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A Smooth Criminal

[Verse 2]
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
He's leaving no clues, left behind him
And they have no way of knowing
Of the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

[Break]
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Bridge]
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A Smooth Criminal

[Chorus]
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom, Annie

[Post Chorus]
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

[Bridge]
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A Smooth Criminal

[Outro]
Annie are you okay? (I don't know)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (I don't know)
There's a sound at the window (I don't know)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? (I don't know)
He came into your apartment (I don't know)
Left bloodstains on the carpet (I don't know why baby)
And then you ran into the bedroom (Help me)
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie, (Daggonit)
Annie are you okay? (Daggonit baby)
Will you tell us that you're okay? (Daggonit baby)
There's a sound at the window (Daggonit baby)
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie
He came into your apartment, (Daggonit)
Left bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down (Daggonit)
It was your doom Annie
