From underneath the outback
To somewhere close to hackensack
Here we come
You got ugly buildings
And shitty culture
But here we come
Ooh.. never thought you'd see us
In this position
And now we are taking you out

You can't see us but we're there
That's what makes you stop and stare
You wonder what it's all about
We're bringing you all
Slowly to the boil
We've got fire and oil

So maybe you can't understand
Any kind of mission
Against capitalism and television
Slowly we come
And now we're taking you out

You can't see us but we're there
It's what makes you stop and stare
You wonder what it's all about
We're bringing you all
Slowly to the boil
We've got fire and oil

Fire and oil
Fire and oil
Fire and oil
Fire and oil
