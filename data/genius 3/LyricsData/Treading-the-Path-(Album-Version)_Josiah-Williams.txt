[Verse One:]
Tell me to be a man again, instead of living like a mannequin
Taking the back end road, running... Panicking
I packed again and put the luggage in the truck
But really I'd be lucky if you even gave a [...]
I put you through a lot of shit... Bull
And verbally I gave you a fist.... Full
You know I never meant it...
Anger reacted, made me demented
That's all it was

I spent many nights mentally locked
I took an aim at the core... Centrally shocked
I had a sit down with let down, a court date with sorrow
Hoping for a chance to look in the eyes of tomorrow
I hope the sense of sight
Doesn't vanish in the flicker or the movement of a star in the night
I promise that I won't forget the sound
Of the wind as it looked at me slowly and turned around

[Verse Two:]
You told me I've been letting you down, and I know it
A bundle of emotions that I own but won't show it
Hiding in the fear of a mistake that once happened
But can't seem to address the mess, what's happened?
All I do is yell, vandalize and scream
At memories on walls that are written but unseen
I try to tell the truth but let the truth be told:
I'm a product, disposed of soul and unsold
Take the anger and move it from inside of you
Kick me in the heart and do the same things that I do
Tell me that I'm useless and ruthless
And when I go to war, I'll be battling where love, peace & truth is
My mistakes are unbearable, and even if I'm hurt...
Compared to you it's incomparable
I promise that I won't forget the sound
Of her body as she looked at me slowly and turned around

[Verse Three:]
If I take away the keys would it mean something?
I can't breathe, my breath found a stream
Running. Because flow isn't the better of words
Unless I, smoothly climb this ladder of verbs
Action. Then take off, can't brush the mistake off
Too easy to carry but too heavy to shake off
Can't take it. I'm lost... Gone... You left me
I could walk the road forever... It's still empty
