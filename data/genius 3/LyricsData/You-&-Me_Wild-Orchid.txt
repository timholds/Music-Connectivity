You know I love you baby
You know I love you boy

Now that we've traveled through mountains
Now that we swam through the sea
I'm sure we can go just a little bit further
As long as there's still you and me

Ahead I can see a few showers
Maybe we'll weather a storm
It's my turn to watch as you sleep by the meadow
I'll keep us both safe from all harm

Just as long as I know that you're here with me
We can crumble the mountains divide the sea
If we try than we can, if we stick to the plan
Of L-O-V-E as long as there's still you and me
You and me, you know I love you baby
You know I love you boy

Now that we've traveled through mountains
Now that we swam through the sea
I'm sure we can go just a little bit further
As long as there's still you and me

Side by side, hand in hand we'll keep moving
Temptation might call out my name
You'll be the first to say go ahead and answer
And I'll be the first one to say

Just as long as I know that you're here with me
We can crumble the mountains divide the sea
If we try than we can, if we stick to the plan
Of L-O-V-E as long as there's still you and me
You and me, you know I love you baby
You know I love you boy

Now that we've traveled through mountains
Now that we swam through the sea
I'm sure we can go just a little bit further
As long as there's still you and me

The magic that's found in dreams
Is the music you put in me
We'll build castles up in the sky
That's the power of you and I

As long as there's still you and I
As long as there's still you and me
You know I love you baby
You know I love you boy

Now that we've traveled through mountains
Now that we swam through the sea
I'm sure we can go just a little bit further
As long as there's still you and me
