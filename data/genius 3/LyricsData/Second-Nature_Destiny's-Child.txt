[Intro:]
Second nature
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey
Second nature

[Verse: Beyoncé]
Why does love always seem so very hard?
It's such a struggle
To win the reward
Because we're playin' with the wrong cards
But I think I've got the winnin' hand
There's something different about you, babe
That tells me I can
I say it's easy for the things that I do;
Never a question
Always a pleasure to
Love you, love you, love you

[Pre-Chorus:]
Baby, I won't say no
The love that you give is so
I'm hooked and I can't let go of this love

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
It's so natural
So natural to give my love
It's so easy (easy like second nature)
Second nature (second nature)
It's so natural
So natural to give my love
Like no other
(Simple like second nature)
Second nature (second nature)

[Post-Chorus: (Beyoncé)]
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey, (Ooh... hey, baby, baby)
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey

[Verse: Beyoncé]
Thinkin' of you is the breath that I take
Just for your love, I can't wait
I could never think twice
It wakes me up in the mornin'
And in the middle of the night
And with a smile on my face
I'm ready

[Pre-Chorus: (Beyoncé)]
Baby, I won't say no (won't say no)
The love that you give is so (give is so)
I'm hooked and I can't let go of this love

[Chorus: (Beyoncé)]
It's so natural
So natural to give my love (Give you my love)
It's so easy
Second nature
(second nature)
(Second nature)
It's so natural, so natural to give my love
Like no other (I know, I know)
Second nature (Second nature)
It's so natural
So natural to give my love
(Oh, baby, baby, it's so natural to give you every bit of my love)
It's so easy
Second nature
(Second nature)
It's so natural
(It's so natural!)
So natural to give my love
(To give you all of my love)
Like no other
Second nature
(Second nature)

[Post-Chorus:]
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey
Ooh, ooh, hey, hey...

[Outro:]
Ooh-ooh, hoo, ooh
Hey, hey (Second nature)
It's so natural, baby
To give you all of me (Second nature)
(Second nature)
And if you want it, then you got it (Second nature)
Baby
(Second nature)
(Ooh, oh-oh)
(Second nature)
Second nature
(Second nature)
Second nature, hey, yay
(Second nature)
Second nature
(Second nature)
