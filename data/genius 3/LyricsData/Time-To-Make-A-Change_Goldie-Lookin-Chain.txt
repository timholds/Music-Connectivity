Time for the GLC to make a change innit

Lookin' back, times they was whack
I used to steal from my grandma, my style was so slack
Nothing i could do to stop sucking on a brew (?)
If I kept on this way next stop was the glue
Had to get away, had to find a way out
So I raised up my fist and gave a GLC shout

Tidy

Lookin back, I was on the edge
But I had to make a pledge
To the GLC, cos you knows they'll set you free
And if you open your eyes you can see
You knows it
1983 to the present day
Safe as fcuk
Knows it

Yeah, the GLC saved a lot of people's lives
Stopped a lot of people getting stabbed with big knives
All these people here in one big crew
... (?) between me and you
We wanna stop all the violence on the streets
We wanna get the kids together
Wanna make 'em feel sweet
We gotta stop all the stuff thats goin' on
... (?), and smoke on a bong

GLC GLC (serious)
The only thing in life what could ever save me (respect)
GLC GLC (38 double D Killer, ... (?)
The only thing in like what could ever save me (2000 AD)
GLC GLC (the rod (?))
The only thing in life what could ever save me (Benwa Balls)
GLC GLC (One Step Down)
The only thing in life what could ever save me (Burnside)

GLC knows it

2000 AD

2000 AD was a bad boy you see
That's what they said back in early '83
It wasn't my fault, my father was a boozer
He used to beat me up and said I was a loser
But times they have changed
My style's less insane
Cos I sees the light in the Goldie Lookin Chain
Big shout out to DCI Burnside
Billy Webb

You fcukin' knows it

You know, sometimes I go into Pil late at night
I sees robbings and beatings
People smokin' draw
I think, there's gotta be a better way man
Ya know, I think it's time for the GLC to make a change
It's time to make a fresh start
Like Biggie n 2Pac, innit

GLC GLC
The only thing in life what could ever save me
GLC GLC
The only thing in life what could ever save me
GLC GLC
The only thing in life what could ever save me
GLC GLC
The only thing in life what could ever save me

Lookin back, times was strange
Like Barry Bethel makin the change
Blastin through, using tablets and pills
At community centres I got the skills
But now we gets together in the GLC
And smokes loads of fags and has cups of tea
You gotta do it
Join in too
Like YTS when you're smacked out on glue

Oh son, the days of the 9 bar are over
It's all ounces and quarters now clart
Serious man, I'm serious
There's no room for gangsters on the streets no more
There's no room for beatin's or fightin
It's time for chillin' innit

Fresh

Lord of lords
King of kings
Concrete lion in Newport
Screwface
Fcuk knows who screwface is
Razz as fcuk
Heavy flow
