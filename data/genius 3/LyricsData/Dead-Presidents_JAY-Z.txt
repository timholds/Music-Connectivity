Presidents to represent me
I'm out for presidents to represent me
I'm out for dead fuckin' presidents to represent me

[Verse 1: Jay-Z]
While others spit that Wonderama shit, me and my conglomerate
Shall remain anonymous, caught up in the finest shit
Live out my dreams until my heart give out
Involved with cream, you know exactly what this shit's 'bout
Fuck y'all mean? Handlin' since a teen, I dish out
Like the point guard off your favorite team, without doubt
My life ain't rosy but I roll with it
My mind was fine 'til the dough hit it
And told me that the Mo' did it
And now it's kosher, shit is so Hasidic
I blow a digit on a diamond in a minute but no bitches
Watch how I'm walkin'
'Cause even the thoroughest niggas be narc'in
Tryin' to strike a bargain, hopin' that they might get pardoned
Shit I'm involved with got me pins and needles
And my cerebral breeds the wickedest evil
Thoughts that this sport'll feed you
Peep facts, in the game so deep fiends could catch ya
Freeze off my knee cap, can y'all believe that?
Got the city drinkin' Cristals, re-up the fee
Rappers goin' broke tryin' to keep up with me
My rise to riches surprised the bitches: think harder
You know this nigga: Jay-Z, Shawn Carter
G.S. the fuck up, dress the fuck up
Watch me shine like a Breitling, begets the fuck up
All rhymers forget it like Alzheimer's
Small timers, I said it, I'm addressin' all dramas; talk to me!

[Verse 2: Jay-Z]
So sick of niggas, "I want money like Cosby" â€“ who wouldn't?
This the kinda talk that make me think
You probably ain't got no puddin'
Niggas got them kinda dreams from Jay
You in the streets, nigga, make your moves, get your mail
Niggas'll coast in the SL but can't post bail
Niggas'll roast a L but scared to throw your toast, well
I'm here to tell niggas it ain't all swell
There's heaven and then there's hell, niggas
One day you're cruisin' in your 7
Next day you're sweatin', forgettin' your lies
Alibis ain't matchin' up, bullshit catchin' up
Hit with the RICO, they repo your vehicle
Everything was all good just a week ago
'Bout to start bitchin', ain't you?
Ready to start snitchin', ain't you?
I'll forgive your weak-ass: hustlin' just ain't you
Aside from the fast cars, honeys that shake they ass at bars
You know you wouldn't be involved
With the underworld dealers, carriers of MAC-millers
East Coast bodiers, West Coast cap-peelers
Little monkey niggas turn gorillas
Stopped at the station, filled up on octane
And now they not sane and not playin', that goes without sayin'
Slingin' day in and day out
'Til money play in, then they play you out
Tryin' to escape my own mind, lurkin' the enemy
Representin' infinity with presidencies, you know?
