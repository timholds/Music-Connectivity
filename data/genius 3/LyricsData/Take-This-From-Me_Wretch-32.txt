[Intro: Wretch 32]
Woo
Now, now I'm a man with strong beliefs
And that's something that no one can ever take from me
Or you
Now, you may only be the employee
But that don't mean that your boss can take your integrity
Or your passion
And remember
They can never take your soul

[Verse 1: Wretch 32]
Listen, I reckon they'll have to take my life
Before they ever get to take my pride, I won't go down
They ain't seen how the great's designed
I don't break, I just change with time, I've got my own sound
My own style is fashion, my own drive is passion
I'm in the seat with the driver strapped in
On the beat like the hi-hats clapping
In the street like the sirens flashing
Where the police are tryna direct action
Cuh they can't flip the script
The cliffhanger's got a hell of a grip
Cuh when we get banged up, they know we ain't telling 'em ish
Cuh they can waste our time, that don't mean they can take our pride, no
They can't take our style
We're so fly, they can't take us down, I'm so right
And power to the queens cuh you make us proud
Cuh you won't never let them take your crown, you know why?
Cuh it takes a king just to lay you down
And if you take him in, then he has to take you out
And that's the way to live, I just have to say this now
We've been making it, now we have to say this loud

[Hook: Badness]
They could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
No, no, they could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
No, no, they could never take this from me
They could never take this from me

[Verse 2: Wretch 32]
Uh, cuh British Gas are just taking liberties
The bailiffs are on, tryna take my dignity
But they can't even take my Freeview, I taped the preview
More chance tryna take my similes
My metaphors make me spiritually the best
I'm lyrically obsessed, I'm literally a wretch, yes
The labels are tryna rape the industry
But they could never take me physically, no homo
The bank don't wanna take no interest
Until they wanna take the interest, that's so low
And I ain't even scraping big cheques
A couple grand, now they wanna make me invest
My son's my life, his mum's tryna make him mad at me
She's tryna take my sanity
But I ain't gonna lie, I've been breaking gradually
The vibe, like, faded rapidly, it's over
And I don't even know what it's over
But deep down, I know I'm a soldier
Becuh alcoholic drinks only make me sober
So they could never take me over

[Hook: Badness]
They could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
No, no, they could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
No, no, they could never take this from me
They could never take this from me

[Bridge: Badness]
Cuh we never let them take every penny that we make
Or we're never gonna break these chains
And we come from the estate where there's never any change
So you know we have to scrape these plates
Cuh we never gonna break these chains
And we never gonna pay these rates
Cuh we never gonna pay, and we never gonna pay
And we never gonna pay this rate

[Hook: Badness]
They could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
No, no, they could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
They could never take this from me
No, no, they could never take this from me
They could never take this from me

[Outro: Badness]
Take this
They could never take this
No, no, they could never take this
No, no, they can't take this
They could never take this
They could never take this
Could never take this, no
They could never take this
Take this
They could never take this
