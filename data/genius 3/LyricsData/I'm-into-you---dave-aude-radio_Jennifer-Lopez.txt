Na na nananana nana na-eh
Ahem, Hi, I'm Tune, the man on the moon
I live on the beach, get the sand out ya shoes
And all of that changed since I met you
So we can leave that old shit in the restroom
Ok, now I'm into you, like you never knew
I'm falling for you baby, I need a parachute
So wet, I need a wetsuit
You're way too fly, I could be ya jet fuel
Now tell me what you like
I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, than you can overwhelm me
It's too late, it's too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race
Young Money!...
You've got me and I could not defend it
I tried but I had to surrender
Your style got me under the spell
Left me no other choice but to get down
It's too late (it's too late), it's too late (it's too late)
It's too late, it's too late
You've got it (you've got it), you've got it (you've got it)
You've got it (you've got it), you've got it
When I look into your eyes, it's over
You've got me hooked with your love controller
I'm trippin' and I could not get over
I feel lucky like a four leaf clover
Cuz I'm into you, I'm into you
I'm into you, yeaaah
I'm into you, I'm into you
I'm into you, yeaaah
Nana nananana nana-na-eh
Listen, now I'm strong baby I bring the fire on
Sharp shooter, you can call me the zion
I'm not the one easy to get to
But all that changed, baby when I met you
It's too late (it's too late), it's too late (it's too late)
It's too late (it's too late), it's too late
You've got it (you've got it), you've got it (you've got it)
You've got it (you've got it), you've got it
When I look into your eyes, it's over
You've got me hooked with your love controller
I'm trippin' and I could not get over
I feel lucky like a four leaf clover
Cuz I'm into you, I'm into you
I'm into you, yeaaah
I'm into you, I'm into you
I'm into you, yeaaah
Nana nananana nana-na-eh
I'm not burning and I'm feeling you boy
Get it on if you feeling my world now
I love the way that you moving
And I'm listening to how you grooving
So if you need me, just call on the cruise
We can be whatever that you want in the news
Boy, cause I'm on it, you on it, we on it
So baby just tell me now
When I look into your eyes, it's over
You've got me hooked with your love controller
I'm trippin' and I could not get over
I feel lucky like a four leaf clover
Cuz I'm into you, I'm into you
I'm into you, yeaaah
I'm into you, I'm into you
I'm into you, yeaaah
Nana nananana nana-na-eh
Cuz I'm into you, I'm into you
I'm into you, yeaaah baby
I'm into you, I'm into you
I'm into you, yeaaah
