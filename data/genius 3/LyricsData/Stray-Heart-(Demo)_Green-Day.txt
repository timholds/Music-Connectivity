I lost my way, oh baby, this stray heart
Went to another, can you recover, baby?
Oh you're the only one that i'm dreamin' of
Your precious heart
Was torn apart by me
And you? You're not alone
Oh, now im where i belong
We're not alone, oh i'll hold your heart and never let go!

Everything that i want
I want it from you
But i just can't have you
Everything that i need
I need from you
But i just can't have you

Oh i said it a thousand times
And now a thousand and one
We'll never part
I'll never stray from you again
The dark is destined for a home in your heart
We'll never part
I'll never stray from you again
You're not alone
Oh, now im where i belong
We're not alone, oh i'll hold your heart and never let go!

Everything that i want
I want it from you
But i just can't have you
Everything that i need
I need from you
But i just can't have you

Everything that i want
I want it from you
But i just can't have you
Everything that i need
I need from you
But i just can't have you
