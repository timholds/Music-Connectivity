(Oo hoo ooh-ooh ooh-ooh)
Welcome back (How you doin' ladies?)
(Yoo hoo) Y'all already know what it is
(Ooh-ooh)
(You can't touch this, yeah)
Yg and another big bang
(Come on)

I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid in love
I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid in love

How could you be so
How could you be sou
Mou arienai yo (How to believe her)
Jibun katte na sono taido tsukiru koto no nai uso

Blah blah blah...
Let's go

Girl you got me in love, all in for the win
Locked to your love so true honey-boo
Not a thought to upset ya, it rocks to've met ya
Diamonds and pearls couldn't match up my win
Wanna be aware move a little more slow
Never pickin' up the phone, it's gettin' kinda wack, uh!
So shady baby, that's wrong
After all you did, you deserve this song

Aimai na kankei
To itsume tatte
Kotae no nai game (ah-oh)

Monday to Sunday, furi mawasare
Hey Baby don't lie to me, Oh!

Hey You're a stupid liar, You're a stupid liar
Bare bare na uso nado mou iranai
You're a stupid liar, You're a stupid liar
You know? I know! We know! (We know)

Kono mama ja kimi wo
Baby I'm gonna hate you
Chika tdzukitakunai Baby don't do this

You're a stupid liar, You're a stupid liar
Liar Liar, Stupid liar liar liar liar

How could you be sou
How could you be mou
Nani ga uso? Kimi no subete ga kowakute
Tada... Damaru shika naku tonari de waraun da

Let me tell ya... Surely it was you and me we'd see the sunset risin'
One day you would come up surprisin'
Straight mean bein', how you gonna flip that from lovely to grimy
It'a shakin' my head... ã€€ no doubt it's zone in the red...
Step back relax look back never that
Our love just fade to black

Hey You're a stupid liar, You're a stupid liar
Zoku zoku saseru hodo, Psycho na lady
You're stupid liar, You're stupid liar
You know? I know! We know! (We know)

Demo au to naze ka
Baby I can't hate you
Fukami ni hamatte You know I love you

You're a stupid liar, You're a stupid liar
Liar Liar, Stupid liar liar liar liar

Shinjitsu wa doko e? Mou mienai yo
Chiipu sugiru wana nuke dasenai yo

I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid
I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid
I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid, I'm so stupid
Oh no

Hey You're a stupid liar, You're a stupid liar
Bare bare na uso nado mou iranai
You're a stupid liar, You're a stupid liar
You know? I know! We know! (We know)

Kono mama ja kimi wo
Baby I'm gonna hate you
Chika tdzukitakunai Baby don't do this

You're a stupid liar, You're a stupid liar
Liar Liar, Stupid liar liar liar liar
