Once the dogs had quit their barking
Son my neighbor said to me
Know the emptiness of talking blue
The same old sheep
Run, I'll do no more this walking
Haunted by a past I just can't see anymore, anymore
Well, let me tell you
I never meant to let go of the hand
That's been clinging by its thick country skin
To my yellow country teeth
To my yellow country teeth

Far, far away from West Virginia
I'll try New York City
Explaining that the sky holds the wind
The sun rushes in
A child with a shotgun can shoot down
Honeybees that sting
Oh, this boy could use a little sting!
Alright

Who will get me to a party
Who do I have yet to meet
You, you look a bit like coffee
And you taste a little of me
How can I keep me from moving
Now I need a change of scenery
Just listen to me
I won't pretend to understand
The movement of the wind
Or the waves in the ocean
Or like the hours, I change softly
Slowly, plainly, blindly, oh me
Oh my
