Will You Leave me in the dark?
Will stay if things are hard?
Will You Leave me in the dark?
Will stay if things are hard?
Feels Like Forever

[Verse 1]
I feels like forever i am trapped in a cage
Drinking my emotions cause i bottled up the rage
5 Years later now I'm 19 turn the page
The fans listen to me now its like i am sage
Jee-Wizz, how did i get into this rappin' bizz'
Never thought it would end up like this
Never thought i could live my life in bliss
Get me in the studio I'm gonna go far!
Mumma always told me i was gonna be a star
Don't have a car so i pedal on my bike
Fuck all you haters i will do what i like
Here's a new style that i think you will like
As Strummin' on my guitar is rap on mic
My hearts on my sleeve will you promise to protect it?
Cause i have funny feelin' that you just might forget it

[Hook]
Will You Leave me in the dark?
Arn't you clever?
Will you space things apart?
Feels Like Forever
Will You Leave me in the dark?
Arn't you clever?
Will you space things apart?
Feels Like Forever

[Verse 2]
Feels like forever they've been try'na hold me down
Feels like forever i've been painted as a clown
Feels like forever i've been drinkin' round this town
Feels like forever but coming right up now
You can't stop me cause am headed for the top
I will never stop until my heart goes POP
Until i turn soft or the day that i die
I point my middle finger up to the sky
Fuck all these MC's living in a lie
Spittin' bout guns and I'm wondering why?
Do you not try, To be legit?
Or is it that your life just wasn't shit
Trying to talk like your from bottom
When your whole life you've been spoiled rotten
I am rappin' for the people that have been forgotten
So until thee end there is just no stoppin'
Me

[Hook 2]
Will You Leave me in the dark?
Will you space things apart?
