[Hook: French Montana]

Bust a dance move
Pop a bottle, pop a tag, and bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, like a damn fool
Do the money dance, hundred racks a watch
Hundred grand, tell em’ bring a mop
Pop a bottle, pop a tag, and bust a dance move
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move

[Verse 1: Wale]

Look, look
Yeah lot of strong
All up in they V.I
Smokin’ on what seems to be loud
Eyes lookin’ like Mr. Miya
Lot of shones
Nigga can’t you tell that we high
And before I leave, I’ll peace out
Let me see that camel, three times
Slight work though, lightwork though, my girl don’t
Y’all girl go where my girl go and you there alone
Two nights, made a hundred grand
Pair of Nikes like one to ten
It was hustle time and y’all walked it out
When the money right, y’all runnin’ man
Pullin' up the whole cabbage patch
This is not from no cataract
If you could understand what this watch cost
You would understand why I try and adapt
Me and him cannot shake hands, why trap when I’m a free man
You so a loss, you a robot, who done told y’all niggas to break dance

[Hook: French Montana]

[Verse 2: Fabolous]

I think the NFL must think I'm a damn fool
Every time I touch down I bust a dance move
They used to have a movement now they can't move
Used to be on they Grizzly like Vancouv
Bout to make them grams move, L.A. to St. Lou
Say you got them toys, that Santa story just ain't true
Say you got this money, I'm no snitch I can't tell
Call me M.C. Hammer name a bitch that I ain't nail
Can't Touch This, You know that You Can't Touch this
All black jewelery, now that should do it justice
Told her come and bust this, you look like you does this
Come and rub my head girl, teach me how to douglas
