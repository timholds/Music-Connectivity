[Verse 1: Beyonce, with LeToya]
Why don't you just admit it
Cause I don't need your gratitude?
And don't you try to hide it
Just tell me the truth
I can't go on this way
Looking for something
That isn't there
Should I be on my way
Because I need
A reason for this mess

[Chorus:]
Tell me
If you don't love me anymore
Just tell me
If you don't care about me anymore
Just tell me
If you don't want it
Just tell me (tell me)

[Verse 2: Beyonce, with LeToya]
I never thought this day would come
But a test of love I need from you
Honesty's always seen through eyes
I wish you would believe
I'm giving you my all
But it's not pleasing (your distant heart)
If you respect my love you'll hear my plea

[Chorus:]
Tell me
If you don't love me anymore
Just tell me (won't you tell me)
If you don't care about me anymore (you don't care about my anymore)
Just tell me (tell me, if you don't want it)
If you don't want it
Just tell me
(Mmm)
(All you gotta do)
(All you got to do is tell me!)
Tell me
If you don't love me anymore
Just tell me
(You gotta tell me if you don't care. I'll be on my way!)
If you don't care about my anymore
Just tell me
(I need to know)
If you if you don't want it
Just tell me

[Guitar break:]
Do do do do do do do do do
La la la la la la la la la

[Chorus:]
Tell me (tell me)
If you don't love me anymore (if you don't love me)
Just tell me (if you don't need me, if you don't care. Boy, let me know)
If you don't care about me anymore
Just tell me
If you don't want it (baby)
Just tell me

[Repeat Chorus While:]
Tell me, baby
Tell me, baby
Tell me, baby
Tell me, baby
Tell me, baby
Tell me, tell me
