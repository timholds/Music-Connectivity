[Intro]
Uhh, what?
Uhh... uhh uhh
Let's go

[Verse 1]
Called you on the phone said I'm coming through
Hope you're all alone, because I got plans for you
We could stay at home
Or dance and hang all night
As long as I'm with you, doesn't matter what we do

Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm going to do, just know that I'm here with you
Don't try to understand
Baby, there's no mystery, because you know how I am

[Chorus] [Jennifer] [P. Diddy]
I'm real - what you get is what you what you see
What you trying to do to me
You want to say you're mine
Be with me all the time
You're falling so in love
Say you just can enough
You're telling all your friends (She's a bad, bad bitch)

[Verse 2]
Whoo, come on, come on, uhh, in the pocket
You like the way I dress, the way I wear my hair
Show me off to all your friends and, baby I don't care
Just as long as you tell them who I am
Tell them I'm the one that made you give a damn

Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm going to do, just know that I'm here with you
Don't try to understand
Baby, there's no mystery, because you know how I am

[Chorus]
I'm real - what you get is what you what you see
What you trying to do to me
You want to say you're mine
Be with me all the time
You're falling so in love
Say you just can't get enough
You're telling all your friends (She's a bad, bad bitch)

I'm real - what you get is what you what you see
What you trying to do to me
You want to say you're mine
Be with me all the time
You're falling so in love
Say you just can't get enough
You're telling all your friends (She's a bad, bad bitch)

I'm real - what you get is what you see
What you trying to do to me
You want to say you're mine
Be with me all the time
You're falling so in love
Say you just can't get enough
You're telling all your friends (She's a bad, bad bitch)

I'm real - what you get is what you see
What you trying to do to me
You want to say you're mine
Be with me all the time
You're falling so in love
Say you just can enough
You're telling all your friends (She's a bad, bad bitch)

Don't ask me where I've been
Or what I'm going to do, just know that I'm here with you
Don't try to understand
Baby, there's no mystery, because you know how I am

I'm real - what you get is what you see
What you trying to do to me
You want to say you're mine
Be with me all the time
