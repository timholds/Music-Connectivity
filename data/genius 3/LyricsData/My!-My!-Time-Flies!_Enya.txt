[Verse 1]
My! My! Time flies! One step and we're on the moon
Next step into the stars
My! My! Time flies! Maybe we could be there soon
A one way ticket to mars

[Verse 2]
My! My! Time flies! A man underneath a tree
An apple falls on his head
My my time flies a man wrote a symphony
It's 1812

[Vocalisation Hook]

[Verse 3]
My! My! Time flies! Four guys across Abbey Road
One forgot to wear shoes
My! My! Time flies! A rap on a rhapsody
A king who's still in the news
A king to sing you the blues

[Vocalisation Hook]

[Verse 4]
My! My! Time flies! A man in a winter sleigh
White white white as the snow
My! My! Time flies! A new day is on its way
So let's let yesterday go

[Outro]
Could be we step out again
Could be tomorrow, but then
Could be 2010
