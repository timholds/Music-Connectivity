[Verse 1]
Moving too fast
Returning to a new black hole
Air tight
I've been reading up on self control
Nice room
These plants really clean the air
I made up my mind
So quickly I was unaware

[Chorus]
I feel like an island
All boiled down
Until I get home
That's all I ever needed
And if I was smart
I would believe it now

[Verse 2]
It's so late
What are they talking about?
No sweat
But I feel like I just found out
I'm such a mess
You look like a mind on fire
I need your help
But I don't know what I require

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Happiness takes time
And time is my life
And if I have no time
Then am I still alive?
Tell me what I know
Tell me what I know
I know it's on your mind

[Chorus]
I feel like an island
All boiled down
Until I get home
That's all I ever needed
And if I was smart
I would believe it now
