The first time's easy I could walk away, but something in me makes me stay
The second I leave you I'm without
Third time lucky without a doubt this disease is growing in me from a seed into a twisted tree

It's like an obsession, an addiction
You keep on running straight across, straight across my mind
I'll never look away
It's like the sun has opened up my eyes
You're straight across my mind (my mind)
Straight across my mind (my mind)

Forced expression fails to meet expectations of the weak
Cinco de Mayo comes again
Six years dying to understand this disease that's growing in me from a seed into a twisted tree

It's like an obsession, an addiction
You keep on running straight across, straight across my mind

I'll never look away
It's like the sun has opened up my eyes
You're straight across my mind

Now this disease is growing in me from a seed into a twisted tree

It's like an obsession, an addiction
You keep on running straight across, straight across my mind
I'll never look away
It's like the sun has opened up my eyes
It's like the sun has opened up my eyes
You're straight across my mind (my mind)
Straight across my mind (my mind)
Straight across my mind
