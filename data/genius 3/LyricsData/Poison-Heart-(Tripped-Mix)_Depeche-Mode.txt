[Verse 1]
You have poison in your heart
Yeah I'm sure of it
I knew right from the start
From the moment we met
You know we have to break up
You'll always be alone

[Verse 2]
There's poison in your mind
Yeah I'm sure of it
You've never been that kind
With all due respect
You know it's time to break up
You'll always be alone

[Chorus]
You know you've never ever been a friend
Now we're closer to the end
Oh oh oh, no
Oh oh oh, no

[Bridge]
We've been walking far too long this icy road
My broken heart is colder than a stone
I know you've never ever been a friend
Now you've pushed me to the end

[Outro]
Oh oh oh, no
Oh oh oh, no
