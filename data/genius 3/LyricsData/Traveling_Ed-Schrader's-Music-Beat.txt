Traveling is really my thing
I like to travel
See you on a bus at night
With sand in your eyes

Dinner at a stop upstate
Little drive-in
Stubble on an Italian face
Hiding my trance
Dreamscapes
I'm just a man and I like my space
Devil in the lightning
Devil in the lightning
Devil in the lightning
Yea

Traveling is really my thing
I like to travel
See you on a bus at night
With blood in your eyes

Ferry/Fairy with a lock and key
Scarlet map of your mind
Ferry/Fairy with a lock and key
She's got a map of your mind

Traveling
I'm always traveling
I'm always traveling
I'm always traveling
I'm always traveling
