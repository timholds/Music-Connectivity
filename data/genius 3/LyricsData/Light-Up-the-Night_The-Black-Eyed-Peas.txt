[Intro]
Ayooo! {*repeat 4X*}

[Hook: will.i.am]
Wait a minute.. uno dos
It's time to go.. adios
It's on and poppin, and we ain't stoppin
Let's light up the night, let's light up the night
I got it all in my pocket, and we gonna rock it
Let's light up the night, let's light up the night
Baby it's on and poppin, and we ain't stoppin
Let's light up the night, let's light up the night
I've got it all in my pocket, and we gonna rock it
Let's light up the night, let's light up the night

[Will.i.am]
Wait a minute.. uno dos
It's time to go.. adios
Hot beats pumpin out the box, yeah turn it up
Hot fire comin out of my torch, I'mma burn it up
Hot ladies walk up in the club - honey, what's up?
Honey, what's up? C'mon, let's go
The big bass pumpin like a thunder sound
Honey got a bottom bouncin droppin low, underground
Drop it low, submarine, off the flo', trampoline
I got the fire burnin blazin, bring me gasoline

[Hook]

[Fergie: repeat 4X]
Wait a minute (I think we need to slow it down)

[Apl.de.ap]
Big beats bangin out the speaker make a earthquake
I'm a baker's man, make dough and I get cake
My jag is flatter I'mma rip the shit apart
I ain't sayin nada, but you know this shit by heart
(Ayo!) I got these party people screamin sayin
(Ayo!) I make it hot, got them ladies screamin
(Ayo!) I break out like an alien
(Ayo!) My m-m-m-mother know that I ain't playin

[Hook]

[Fergie: repeat 4X]
(Hel-lo!) Wait a minute

[Repeat 2X]
I think we need to slow it down

Ayooo! {*repeat 8X*}
