I'm tired
And I'm broke
I'm run down
I have nowhere to go
I want to sleep
And never awake
Because i'm tired
And my heart is broke
The streets are cold
My feet are cold
My joints are crackling
I'm feeling old
Have been out here for countless days
Nothing at all is coming my way
I might as well call it a day
Release myself and go astray
I'm tired
And i'm broke
I'm falling sleep
I have somewhere to go
I'm going away
Will never come back
I'm falling asleep
Because my heart is broke
