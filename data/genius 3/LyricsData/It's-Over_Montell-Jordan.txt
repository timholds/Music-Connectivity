(Intro)
You don't know how to treat a man
That's what it comes down to
All your girlfriends know
But check it out
All the good things we've been through
(it's all because of you)

It's over (do do do)
I think you should know
That ain't the way love goes
It's over (la no no no)
I think you should know
You need to pack your things and go

That ain't love, that ain't love, girl
And all your girlfriends know
They tell me they've told you so
That I'm not the one to play
And all my boys are tellin' me
That I'm too good to you
And I don't wanna be your fool
So I'll send you on your way

It's over
Oh, it's over
Baby you should know
That ain't the way love goes
It's over
Said it's over, said it's over
I think you should know
You need to pack your things and go

All of the joy that I brought you
All the good times that we shared
I gave you a taste of the good life
Why did you treat me so bad?
Everybody plays the fool sometimes
But this time the joke's on you
What am I supposed to do?
It's all because of you

It's over
Oh, it's over
Baby you should know
That ain't the way love goes
It's over
Said it's over, baby it's over
I think you should know
You need to pack your things and go

It's over
You treated me so wrong
I think you should know
That ain't the way love goes
It's over
Said it's over
I think you should know
You need to pack your things and go

(It's over)
It's over, it's over
Don't you get the picture girl?
I said it's over
You just don't understand
That it's all your fault

(It's over)
It's over, it's over
Don't ya know it's over?
Girl, the happy days are over
And I tell you it's true
It's all because of you
(I'm feelin' sad and blue)

It's over
Baby you should know
That ain't the way love goes
It's over
Said it's over
I think you should know
You need to pack your things and go

(You need to pack up your things and go)
It's over
('Cause baby, the thrill is gone away)
Baby you should know
That ain't the way love goes
It's over
(If you see me walkin down the street, just walk on by)
I think you should know
You need to pack your things and go
