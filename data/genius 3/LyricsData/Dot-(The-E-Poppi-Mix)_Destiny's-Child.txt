Beyonce:
Walking under the maple tree
To myself I am pondering
Thinking about all these things
That's bothering me lately
Why is this pressure all on me?
Why this negativity?
If something's wrong blame it on me
B-E-Y-O-N-C-E

Kelly:
Shut up
No one said to open your mouth
Shut up
If you do not like it how about
Shut up
Why waste your energy on me?
Shut up
Is it cause you wanna be me?

Everybody judging me
Knowing nothing about me
Causing insecurities
Because of someone's jealousy
Losing all my privacy
Wanting much more normalcy
Learning to appreciate mainly
Gifts my God has given me
