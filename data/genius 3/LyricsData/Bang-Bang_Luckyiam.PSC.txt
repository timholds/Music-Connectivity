[Intro: Luckyiam]
Haha
Ready?
Lets go

[Verse 1: Luckyiam]
Lets get it cracking y'all ain't ready, It's enormous
Performance, enduring the boring non informing y'all
A new shit, a warning
Time off I'm touring
Forming my opinion on this industry I'm snoring
We gon' wake up the late fucks recording
They Lebron James but I came up from Jordan
I'm telling y'all this Youtube, five minute fame game
So lame, same thang, nothing really changed
But the characters

[Verse 2: Lana Shea]
Bang Bang
I heard a couple shots
It might be jumping off
I will get up off the block if you're something soft
Fix your face up, sticking to the same stuff
Sitting what the game's got missing
Like I know we're gonna
Give 'em to nutritionalists the newest new edition of
The fewest on our mission just the coolest with the vision
Of the dope shit only, internet phonies
Give 'em microphones and think they in it
But I know we're gonna
Put em in their place, this my foot up in their face
Cuz I'm killing the computer
Blood is spilling, now you're wasted

[Verse 3: Luckyiam]
Damn it's all over
Haha, right about now..
I'm the pick of the litter
I consider, am I bitter?
No I'm better, I'm a winner
We invented hella spitta's
They admit it or the didn't
I'mma kill it till its finished
Till its over, they remains lay
Spread across the kitchen
I ain't bitchin' I'm just pitching heat
Born up out the friction sea
Dick sure makes a miss and it's [?]
It's suppose to be efficient when you choke a beat
World wide or locally
Vocally inclined to get that shine on
Y'all know its me

[Verse 4: Lana Shea]
Punk base licker tell me how my cum taste
See I'm getting off young Shea
And you know I'm flowing
Kicking on they dumb face
Sleeping giants come awake
With my co-conspirator you fear it or you just wait
Imma tough cake, cookie, lookie they mistake me for a rookie
Where they put me subrate
But you know I'm coming up
Coming up, coming up

[Outro: Lana Shea, (Luckyiam)]
Bang bang
(You know)
Ha, (Yeah)
