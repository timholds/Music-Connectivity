Sing her a love song
Sing her a love song
Sing her a love song
Sing, alright now go away

I get home from work, man
Don't wanna see you anywhere near my house
'Cause I know what you're doing
So don't pretend like you're friends with my dad

Drop it like a stone
Like it's sore
Go find somebody else

Drop it like a stone
Like it's sore
Go find somebody else

Ah, you want all of it
Ah, you want all of it
Ah, you're not innocent
Ah, you want all of it

Sing her a love song
Sing her a love song
Sing her a love song
Sing, now I said go away

I get home from work man
I don't wanna see you with the sneaky eyes now
I know you're a romantic
But it's just not the way to go about this

Drop it like a stone
Like it's sore
Go find somebody else

Drop it like a stone
Like it's sore
Go find somebody else

Ah, you want all of it
Ah, you want all of it
Ah, you're not innocent
Ah, you want all of it
(?)

Well it was always
Gonna be the hardest part
Well it was always
Gonna be the first place
That he would've looked now
So why'd you hide on top of the hill
If you didn't wanna get caught
Wanna get caught, now
