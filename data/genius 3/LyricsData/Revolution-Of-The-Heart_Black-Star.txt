Look into these eyes
And tell me who do you recognise
Look into these eyes
And tell me do you really want to be free
Do you want to know the truth
Then tell me how to get it through to you
Come on and tell me can you hear me
Can you hear me calling

Calling for a revolution today
A revolution of the heart
Calling for a revolution of the heart

Look into these eyes
And tell me when are you going to realise
Look into these eyes
And tell me do you really want to believe
Do you want to know the truth
Then tell me how to get it through to you
Come on and tell me can you hear me
Can you hear me calling

Look into these eyes
And tell me do you really feel alive
Look into these eyes
And tell me do you really want to free
Do you want to know the truth
Then tell me how to get it through to you
Come on and tell me can you hear me
Can you hear me calling
