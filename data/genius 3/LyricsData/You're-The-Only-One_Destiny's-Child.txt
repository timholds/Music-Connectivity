[Chorus:]
You're the only one and I think
About you all the time
Every day and night
I can't seem to get you off my mind
You're the only one I'm thinking of

[Verse: Beyonce]
I want you to know that nobody else will get the chance
At getting close to me baby its you
Youre all that i need
You are all I need

[Chorus:]
You're the only one and I think
About you all the time
Every day and night
I can't seem to get you off my mind
You're the only one I'm thinking of

[Verse: Beyonce]
Ohh
I used to think that love was
Something that was only for the others
But lucky ones but now
I see it's me for you, baby

Never gonna let you go

[Chorus:]
You're the only one (and I can say)
And I think about you all the time
(Me and you, baby, that's all I'm thinking lately)
Every day and night
I can't seem to get you off my mind
(Can't seem to get you off my mind)
You're the only one I'm thinking of

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
You're the only one and I think
About you all the time
Every day and night
I can't seem to get you off my mind
You're the only one I'm thinking of

You're the only one I'm thinking of
You're the only one for me

You're the only one I've ever loved
The only one I'm thinking of
Only one I'm thinking of

Only, only one for me

[Chorus:]
You're the only one and I think
About you all the time
Every day and night
I can't seem to get you off my mind
You're the only one I'm thinking of
