[Verse 1]
Uh, yeah
Now only if you knew what I would do to be accepted
Spit about everything I'm going through so you can get me
I do it all to the find the right girl or something special
Make something of this life I'm living so they won't forget me
Dating back to them days before the drop, I used to pedal
Dreamed of putting color into them white skies like some Skittles
I'm middle with these realer skills and 50 milla Ritalin
Popping em like some skittles while listening to some Eminem
Basically what I'm facing facts when I'm looking in the mirror
For so many years myself was screaming "Ain't nobody here"
I's talking but they ain't understand me like I was the deaf or somethin'
I's talking but wasn't saying nothing now I never whisper
I ain't talking with a lisp but I'm spitting like it isn't up to me
I gotta use these skills I's given cause it wasn't up to me
Believe that I'mma keep on giving til they had enough of me
I just do it for the love like its my only one in need please

[Hook]
I'm coming up in this game so don't let me go
And I ain't never gone change so don't let me go
Making my name in this game you gone remember O

[Verse 2]
Yeah
Now growing up I was a fiend for some attention and some women
I'd do anything for a nighter I just wanted to get some
So I used my mind to my advantage
And knew when they fully developed they would feel it
She would dig it, I would get it and she with it
But back before I's spitting never used to get around
I ain't know I had to chill in order for love to be found
Before writing lyrics in classes I spent my time as a clown
Before recording the rhymes all I's getting was shut down
But now a nigga shut it down
All he doing is advancing
I'm running it in my town now they I'm significant
I'm just doing with some sounds so they hit em and upper cut
So get up behind and mount it take hits of this different
When I'm on defense I'm pitching a piece of originality
I will be on my grizzy long after the platinum albums
Counting my days from my up come until my downfall
Until then I'll let the sounds choose my outcome

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
I'm doing it for the love of the game
Feeling you get when you create
Any artist mother or father can relate
Trynna make the life I vision
When I trip more than a dream in which I'm calling everybody
And they outta love for me
Spent them hours in my room just writing and making beats to cypher to
Freestyling rhyming everyday my skill and life improved
Spent my time as a loner at home on my own
While my peers were living their lives I just wanted to live on
The top of it top life I just wanna be looked up to
I grew up looking down, and I still do
You ever know how it feels to be looked through
And passed up while they act like they never knew you
Well I do
Shit I's recognized to lose
I was recognized as who
Never recognized in school
But now they repping Olu
I've been here I'm never selling
So don't forget about the kid you always used to joke about
Bitches (4x)
