Watch the rats start to run
Scattering yet hinting the WORD
Then the POWER man on top
Decided to up down the game
What was that you mumbled
We must stay the course?
Say what you REALLY mean
We've heard this shit before
The fox done stole the eggs
And is spreading em around the den
Sometimes grandmas know
They listen to cackling bins
Two faced media jumpin back in
Regroup re manuvere now the waiting game
All countries voices rise
Call out the rights
Power out em...
Right and wrong
Continue the BREAD
...love UNITY songs
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
