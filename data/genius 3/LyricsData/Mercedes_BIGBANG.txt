Well I'm
No longer here to ease your pain
And you are not going to please me anymore
But the sun
Will shine on buildings were you'll go
And our love lies in the shadows
We both know

I was lying in your lap
The backseat of a mercedes
Was flying
You and me in a taxicab
That drove a little faster
Than we'll do

Sugar
On top means nothing to you
No matter how thought out and sweet
It just won't do
But the sun
Will shine on buildings were we'll go
And our love lies in the shadows
We both know

I was lying in your lap
The backseat of a mercedes
Was flying
You and me in a taxicab
That drove a little faster
Than we'll do
My favourite view
Than we'll do
My favourite view
