[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Talk a lot of shit man, you know that its chill B
Kickin' back loungin' underneath the local shade tree
Still wondering why I'm an escapee
A detainee, that can't see to stay fuckin' free
You know what it is, and you know what we do
Dreamin' bout days when we came through with the crew
Younger days when the air was fresh, sky blue
Better days when I wasn't trash, fucked my world view

[Hook]
Rough shit man, cause my thoughts circular
Looping through my head like a motherfuckin' orbiter
Keep pushing on wondering what it all's for
Keep moving forward and hoping I can restore

[Verse 2]
Like Trump I'm standin' on a tower
But unlike Trump man I'm jumpin' in the next hour
Feels like I'm losing myself and turning sour
It's self vs. self lost in a balance of power
But fuck that man, rather think about the good times
Forget the grime and focus on writin' rhymes
The thoughts are a circle and the shit is causative
Can't lose myself so I focus on the positive

[Hook]

[Outro]
