[Intro: 50 Cent] (x2)
Yeah
I am NY, no lie

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
They say they do it, like I do it with no mask on
Nigga, get the fuck outta line, you getting blast on
Jesus let the weak roam the Earth without a purpose
Well, I’ll stomp ya fucking head til it’s under the surface
Now I need you to get it through ya bloodclot head
‘Fore I put a bullet through ya bloodclot dreads
These niggas ain't made of the same shit I’m made of
I dump a clip for my man if he need a favour
I let a nigga slide he came back and almost shot me
And he was thinking I was scared, nah nigga not me
They don’t understand I was raised by the vultures
Still laughing like hyenas in the crib full of roaches
Call grandmami "mommy" cause mommy already dead
Daddy been missin’ since I was a little kid
Now who dared go there playin’ games with the orphan
They know my pedigree test me I’mma off ‘em

[Hook: 50 Cent] (x2)
Stop the bloodclot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Don’t cry, dry your eye

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
That first body drop, we just getting started, death come in three’s
Ar15, M16, semi-automatic, murder machine
Wave that, blaze that, give a nigga wings
When that blade enter flesh it’s an emergency
Ya love leak, heart open call the surgery
Feels like my last girlfriend I lost her
On second thought I know just where I left her, the alter
See, I have an advantage I don’t care about tomorrow
Find out that I ain't frontin’ when then patience start to fall
You know attempted murder was the case that they gave me
9 bullet wounds, now a nigga half crazy
What is that a tear I see forming in ya eye
Why are you so frightened we’re all gonna die
You can say a prayer when I’m coming like the reaper
Staring through that sight on the top of my heater
Now..

[Hook: 50 Cent]
Stop the bloodclot crying
The kids, the dog, everybody dying, no lying
Don’t cry, dry your eye
Don’t cry, dry your eye
