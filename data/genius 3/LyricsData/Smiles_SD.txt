[Intro]
I see you baby
I see you smiling girl
It ain't hard to tell

[Hook]
I see you smiling
Don't be all frowning baby
I see you smiling
Don't be a diamond baby

[Verse 1: SD]
Let's make ya smile baby
We might have rounds baby
It might go down crazy
Pay no sounds, so down
Don't start or we can't [?] baby
I'm by your side crazy
You won't slow down, well damn baby
Can I drown? I'll go down

[Hook]

[Verse 2: SD]
Bright up
Bright up, bright up
Bright up, bright up
Bright up your smile
Bright up, bright up
Bright
Lets keep you smiling
Your choice, your style don't fear me
I'm here, won't let you down baby
Lets find your crown
Hold me down

[Hook]
