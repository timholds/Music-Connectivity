[Verse 1]
Pippen on the assist
I'm watching Jordan drop a double nickel on the Knicks
That was ‘95, couple of us ain’t live til '96
Gangbanging, 'caine slanging had us caught up in a twist
We was middle school fools, life was rushing past me
Fresh up out Tolleston bus fighting up at Pulaski
Uncle hit me off with a zip, now I get some cash, G
"Where will you get some money for Nikes?" my mama asked me
I got it selling nickle bags
Stress, weed, million seeds, where the liquor at?
Mad Dog 20/20, kept a nigga loose
Murder was the case except a nigga taste the gin and juice
Cause then we gon' be riding on some bullshit
Shoot up a nigga crib, that's some hood shit
And I can give a fuck who in the house sleep
Waking up the neighbors, shoot my trey eight at the police, bitch

[Hook]
I got it selling nickel bags, bitch

[Verse 2]
Chilling with a bitch
Watching LeBron put up 56 on the Knicks
In 2005, police killed my nigga in 2006
Only thing he losing is his pension, ain’t that ‘bout a bitch
If I see that ho I got a slug for him
I wanna kill him slow like I ain't got no love for him
I wanna torture and burn him, drag him to hell with me
This for my nigga just lurking, working that scale with  me
In these last days, on my last page
Fuck a job, I'm whipping this butter cause crime pays
In these last days, on my last page
Fuck a job, I'm serving these cluckers cause crime pays
I'm a lunatic by nature
Yeah, kidnap a family for his paper
Yeah, and if you make it through the day, bro
Yeah, pray to God I ain't stank ya, bitch

[Hook]
