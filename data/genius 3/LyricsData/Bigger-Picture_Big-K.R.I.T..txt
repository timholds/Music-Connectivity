[Intro]
I'll paint all the world for you baby
I'll paint all the world for you
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I'll paint all the world for you baby
(I'll paint all the world for you)

[Hook]
Yeah
I wish you saw the bigger picture
I wish you saw the bigger picture
If I make it I'll come back to get you
Clear as day but you don't see the vision
I wish you saw the bigger picture
What we got deserves some patience
Cause this ain't no finger painting
I wish you saw the bigger picture
Beautiful and modern all the same
But what's a photo if it's out of frame
I wish you saw the bigger picture
(I'll paint all the world for you)
I pray you see the bigger picture

[Verse 1]
I call your phone
You don't pick up, you text me
Too late to come back you say my art ain't even half the way it used to look
The colors that I chose to compose my last masterpiece wasn't worth the cover of a book
I listen as you rant on 'bout Rembrandts and Van Goghs
That, I used to show you was so pure at heart
Now all the pictures that I draw lately perfect my need to be basic and all the shading tears your world apart
Pollock I promise you say it's scribble and scratch
I know you don't mean it cause on your wall's where it sat
It's not my best I agree but I did what I could
With these sticks and these stones to get us out of the woods
I find my rhythm and and my stroke then you fall in love with my art like you did before
On that note I let go and tend to my canvas to paint a mural of us
I hope that you understand the bigger picture

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Back to my roots
Channel my youth
You love the color of yellow but I'm working with blue
Like what's the use of doing art if I ain't breaking the rules
My graffiti wasn't Banksy but you thought it was cool
It used to be fun to watch me do what it do
But when the paint started drying I stopped running to you
I started walking away cause I could paint any day
One line from being complete
I'm sorry I made you wait to get a crown and some space
I thought you'd be a great painter
Cause you could see the good in me in all the angles
A radiant child we could've had
And those clowns in your past you paint, just make you laugh
All because, that self portrait that I put on display should've been of us
I left you out and I was wrong
I promise I'll start over if you come back home

[Hook]

[Bridge x2]
I'll paint the sky blue
I'll paint the grass green
I'll paint the roses red
And everything in between

[Hook]
