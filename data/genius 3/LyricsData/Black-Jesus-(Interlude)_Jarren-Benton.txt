[Verse]
Black Jesus, fuck your pathetic name and your whack thesis
Your momma's a bitch and so is your fat nieces
In a Lex watchin' Kathy Lee & Regis
No peace in the church they come to clap the [?] preachers
Sick of livin', but he too bitch for slittin' his wrist
Typical nigga shit
[?]
She got a new ass and spent the [?]
Paranoid smoke will twist a little [?] and a spliff
My favorite rapper fell off at grandmama house
All that cheap ass furniture eatin Kellogg's
Get a little head, the next morning she write a tell-all
I shoulda [?] the bitch but instead i just go to hell off
I'm a- Hard act to follow
Semi-Auto in your fuckin mouth now thats a hard Mac to swallow
Bitches skinny-dippin' in an all black [garado?]
You niggas are played-out like love books and [movado's?]
