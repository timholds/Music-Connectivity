[Stephen Rice - Hook:]
I know that it's only in my head
I'm the walking dead, with nothing inside
You've got all your things and plans to keep
Just don't fall asleep
(Cause you could be next in line)
(x2)

[Josiah Williams - Verse One:]
I see that your image is clear
These visible tears
Drop below the ground’s surface, they don’t disappear
Many days I go astray within the scariest blue
Fighting the weight of the world, but who’s carrying who?
I can’t promise to be the 2nd King that you expect
My confidence is a mess. I suffer in my neglect
I’ve been breaking down. I’m a wreck
Now these strings on my guitar are out of tune and popping
Snapping dreams that lay afar

Dreams of love joy and peace, my thoughts above destroy each piece
I’m looking to guidance from my throne, but I can’t find the side that I own
Look at the light. Is that my home? Look at the stars. Are those my goals?
Look at this ladder that I climb, but down at the bottom I left my soul

Will you be the one to forgive me? ‘Cause I can’t forgive myself
I’m sick of being so terrified in my body with no help (And I)
Wish that I could be better than what society is demanding
But my wishes just keep falling down
I’m no longer standing

[Stephen Rice - Hook:]
I know that it's only in my head
I'm the walking dead, with nothing inside
You've got all your things and plans to keep
Just don't fall asleep
(Cause you could be next in line)

[Josiah Williams - Bridge:]
It’s getting hard and I can’t get away
I can barely live through the day
I’m holding on and I might let go

What do I do?
Where do I run?
I’m running out of time
I don’t want to be next in line

[Josiah Williams - Verse Two:]
Time passes and I flash into a state of mind
Moving past the inner mass that makes my innards blind
All throughout this I’ve been guilty of a crime within
In actuality the guilt is now the biggest sin
It’s deprived me of a life that I no longer live
They tell me give my all, but there’s nothing I can give
I’ve seen where this can go, and I reject
The old me is dead & gone, I’m refusing to be next

[Stephen Rice - Hook:]
I know that it's only in my head
I'm the walking dead, with nothing inside
You've got all your things and plans to keep
Just don't fall asleep
(Cause you could be next in line)
