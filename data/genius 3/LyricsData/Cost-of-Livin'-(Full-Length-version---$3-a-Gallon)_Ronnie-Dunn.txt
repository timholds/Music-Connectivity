Everything to know about me, is written on this page
The number you can reach me, my social and my age
Yes I served in the army, it's where I learned to shoot
Eighteen months in the desert, pourin' sand out of my boots

No I've never been convicted of a crime
I could start this job at any time

I got a strong back, steel toes, I rarely call in sick
A good truck, what I don't know, I catch on real quick
I work weekends, if I have to, nights and holidays
Give you 40, and then some, whatever it takes

Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up

I put Robert down as a reference, he's known me all my life
We attend the same church, he introduced me to my wife
Gave my last job everything, before it headed south
Took the shoes off of my children's feet, the food out of their mouths

Yesterday my folks offered to help
But they're barely gettin' by themselves

I got a strong back, steel toes, I rarely call in sick
A good truck, what I don't know, I catch on real quick
I work weekends, if I have to, nights and holidays
Give you 40, and then some, whatever it takes

Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high and goin' up

I'm sure a hundred others have applied
Rumor has it you're only takin' five

I got a strong back, steel toes, I'm handy with a wrench
There's nothing I can't drive, nothin' I can't fix
I work sun-up to sun-down, ain't too proud to sweep the floors
Bank has started callin', and the wolves are at my door

Three dollars and change at the pump
Cost of livin's high, and goin' up
