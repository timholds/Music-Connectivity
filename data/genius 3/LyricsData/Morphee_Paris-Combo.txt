In my sinking languor, I forget even the idea
Of immediate happiness, the caresses
That make angel-wings beat high in the heavens
It is the beautiful sleeping one, Hypnos, who eclipses me for all men
"…What is this dreary languor that penetrates my heart…" when I dream, it’s of you
CHORUS
In your arms, I would have loved to feel loved
In your arms, I would have loved to nestle
And my amorous eyes do not dare open a single lash
When you come close to me
In your arms, I would have loved to sink
In your arms, I would have loved to curl up
I haven’t found anything better than the embrace
Of other arms much less amorous
And in the arms of Morpheus I have let myself fall
Plunging my solitary heart into an ephemeral sweetness
"Luxury, calm and voluptuousness" are only granted
After a long, very long, profound sleep
A futile consolation for my succession of nights all the same
