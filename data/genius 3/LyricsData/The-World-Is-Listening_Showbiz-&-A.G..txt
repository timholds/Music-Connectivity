Mama told me there'd be days like these
I prepared for the worst, yeah it hurts

But what my godfather told me always made me go harder

Ms. Beckham told me that the world is mine
The bully at lunchtime said what's yours is mine
A tragic effect, I went and bought the nine
And reverse the outcome went extort his shines

Moms boyfriend was a violent offender
He said he never hit her, nigga lyin', I remember

And I believe 'em and I don't need a reason
