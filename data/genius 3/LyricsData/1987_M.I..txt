M.i - 1987
[K.R.I.T Edition] #SundayNightSixteens
(Week 3-11/10/13)

Intro
I know I be having my moments
I know I be actin’ spiteful.. petty… I’m sayin ungrateful
But life’s long, opinions change
Ima get thru this tho, right
Yea

Hook
Like it was 1987
Mama made a legend
Let me be what I wana be, gotta thank her forever
It was 1987
Folks slipped up, didn’t mean to have me
But fck it, left me with talent
Yeah it was 1987
Thank god I got my brothers / we move city to city, lord we some bad muthafckas
87… now I’m faded layin’ letters down /if my people wit it then let K.R.I.T put these sounds together

Verse
This for my niggas / this for they bitches
Sht, little bit of dope / for Sunday sixteen’s, come witness
Geez… gotta get this doh / ay, im tryna pay these bills
For the people puttin’ in work / hit em’ wit an mp3, what a deal
This for people tryna get meals / workers tryna get to retirement
Sht, we know we the new slaves / you ain’t gotta tell us, time did
This for all the people that lined up / payin’ fines / 9 to 5’d up
High as fck / I’m ridin out on my competition, sht..times up
& I’m sorry but I’m liable to get heated when I hear another liar go
Anywhere near my microphone / it’s mine, i got this / Sign I’m stoned
M.i – Lyrical Jedi / but I silent soul
Been a lil bit loud / I gotta good reason, sit in / get a crash course
Gotta pile of dro / papers & a dime but no
Money, it’s funny we happy at least / we fine, we low
Aay...Sht at least we got this roof & got this food / I got these records, little bit of pape(r) I got this juice
