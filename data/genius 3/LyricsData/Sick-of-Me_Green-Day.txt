Why can't you just admit it?
You've had it, you're sick of me
You're fed up with all my bad habits
You're sick of me
To your lies you've become so desensitized
Sick of me
Lost regrets and you say that youâ€™re mad
And feel sick of me

[Chorus]
Wandering out the door
I am on to you
You're coming back for more
Am I losing you?

Like a dog that just pissed on your barbecue
Sick of me
Losing faith and you still don't know what to do
Sick of me
Loss of health and now you hate everything
And you're sick of me
It's a waste but we still keep on trying
You're sick of me

[Chorus]

So you got your problems
So you got it alright
Do you have a conscience?
Do you have a reason?
I'm sick of you too

[Chorus]
