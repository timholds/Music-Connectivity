I know it's never been perfect
I remember the time you said it was worth it
Just like this run down apartment
It's not what it seems, it can be what we make it

I want you
To say what you need to say
Don't just walk away
Say what you need to say
Don't just turn away from me
Cause our picture in the frame
Is slowly starting to fade away
I don't want to lose you
So say what you need to say

You're always making it so hard
The story's getting old
It's tearing us apart
I want you close but you're so far
What the hell I've got to do to get you to talk

I need you
To say what you need to say
Don't just walk away
Say what you need to say
Don't just turn away from me
Cause our picture in the frame
Is slowly starting to fade away
I don't want to lose you

Hold on, hold on
You're slipping away
Hold on, hold on
You're fading away
Hold on, hold on
Don't walk away

Say what you need to say
Don't just walk away
Say what you need to say
Don't just turn away from me
Cause our picture in the frame
Is slowly starting to fade away
I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose you
I don't want to lose you
So say what you need to say

I know it's never been perfect
