The day I left my world turned black
I promised never to return
But in my search for something new
I realized what I've left behind

Can you hear me now?
I'm calling out to you
Can you hear me now?
I'm coming back for you

You have to give yourself a chance
Just break away and don't look back

Can you hear me now?
I'm calling out to you
Can you hear me now?
I'm coming back for you

The world outside is yours to take
I'll show you things you've never seen
A brand new life with brand new eyes
Just break the chains that hold you down

Can you hear me now?
I'm calling out to you
Can you hear me now?
I'm coming back for you
