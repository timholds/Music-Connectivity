Telly Man, standin' on a band stand, grand standin' bendin' and bangin' them strings
Eye candy shakin' on a dance floor, sayin' "Play me one more," makin' a scene
Cowboy camped on a bar stool, shootin' double whiskey with a longneck back
And Billy with a pool cue starring down an eight ball, lookin' at Kelly with a rack

Out in the country, back roads and one horse towns
We saw fiddles, play our guitars loud
We talk the talk, and walk the walk
And do the Honky Tonk Stomp

Yeah...Pickups in the parking lot, rockin' like a juke box jumpin' in the July air
Cooler in the tool box, drinkin' every last drop...won't let ya take it in there
Whiskey high, two dudes stumblin' out the back door. Bouncers help 'em take it outside
Through the fussin' and the cussin', & the shovin' and the pushin'...well, it really ain't much of a fight

Out in the country, back roads and one horse towns
We saw fiddles, play our guitars loud
We talk the talk, and walk the walk

Out in the country, back roads and one horse towns
We saw fiddles, play our guitars loud
We talk the talk, and walk the walk
