[Chorus]
Baby, when your heart breaks down
When you're low on loving and there isn't anybody around
Well, you're going to feel bad and you'll want to get back
The only good thing that you ever had
Honey, when he turns you loose
And you keep on trying to forget him but it ain't no use
Well, then you're going to know what I'm feeling now
Baby, when your heart breaks down

[Verse 1]
I left Appaloosa and my homemade wine
I give up a job on a gas pipeline
I chased you across the country like that's all I had to do
There was nothing in the world would've changed my mind
You were the girl with the starry eyes
And all them dreams that never had a chance of coming true

[Chorus]

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Well, I packed my bags, bought a guitar
I caught me a ride on an old grain barge
I'm floating down this river trying not to think of you
Now one of these days when it says goodbye
Just to see how hard you'll cry
You'll be trying not to want me too

[Chorus][4x]
