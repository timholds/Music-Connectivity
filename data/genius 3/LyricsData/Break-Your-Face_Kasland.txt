[Intro: Lil Raheezy]
Raheezy, Kasland
Break your face

[Kasland]
Man, have you ever had one of those days like
Where some dude just gets up in your face and like
Starts acting like he knows you

[Verse 1: Kasland]
Hey Kasland, I love your rhymes
I've listened to your single like a dozen times
Shut the hell up you little fuzzy limes
Why you say that? I don't know, cause it rhymes
Ain't that what you say that my lyrics are random
And you hate it when I spray 'em cause you fear it, can't stand them
When you hear it you phantom like a ghost, get gone
When he starts to get fans that's when he knows it's on
The heat is on, pressure full blast
Think you got what it takes in your mind to full Kas
Don't try to pull past or I'll pull your ass back
Light a fucking black cat and shove it up your ass crack
I'm a sicko past that you've got nothing to say
Where you going? Come back, quit walking away
Imma put you in your place like this is your place
So keep on talking and it's fist in your face

[Hook: Kasland]
Sorry little homie but I hate to say
This day today just ain't your day
You got a thing for hating and I hate your taste
So keep we'll talking and I'll break your face

[Lil Raheezy]
Break your face, break your face
Got the game tied up something like a shoe lace
Hating ass niggas fall back stay in your place
Cause you boys washed up, we'll break your face

[Verse 2: Kasland]
Imma break your face, slam it with my fist
If you keep telling me you can't stand it when I diss
All these people when I'm pissed, but do you know why
Then shut the fuck up bitch you can go die
I originally planned for this album to be clean
No explicit content, but then I turned mean
Got pissed off, ripped off a head or two
Be happy that I killed a fucking fag instead of you
I'm pissed off, who want it with me
Bring a goon with you I'll bring a hundred with me
Put your weapons down then we go all hands
About to knock the fucking shit out these so-called fans
People don't believe in me like he's going to fall
Annoyed by the fans when I'm seen in the mall
They think I won't snap while I scream at them all
Yet I'm dumb enough to brawl with Steven Seagal

[Hook: Kasland & Lil Raheezy]

[Verse 3: Lil Raheezy]
Who fucking with me
I spit that coke and my fans O.D
I'll break your face, no I'm not friendly
Show you red slime cause with my nine I'll make you bleed
Yeah something like a cycle
K's on deck, got nines got rifles
Halloween flow, I swear I'm bad like Michael
All my music riding something like motorcycles
So irrelevant, but I don't really give a fuck
Hating ass niggas mad cause they so washed up
Always strapped, got the nine tucked
Like dodge ball, when I shoot better duck
Or just stay in your place
Cause I'm packing homeboy not talking about a suitcase
Got the game tied up something like a shoelace
So keep running your mouth and watch us break your face

[Hook: Kasland & Lil Raheezy]

[Outro: Lil Raheezy]
We'll break your face
We'll break your face
