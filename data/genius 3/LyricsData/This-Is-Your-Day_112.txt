Alone at night
My body craves you
As I let the music play
And we make love in my mind
I feel the chills
As though your here with me
That's why I can't wait
Til you come home just to please me

That's why

If you want the sun
Then I'll shine it your way
And if you want your back rub
Then I'll come right away
And anything you want from me
Baby, you can have it your way
Ohhh... Girl
This is your day

Its all your day

Baby, you know you make my day
When your with me
Please forgive me
If I showered you with diamond rings
And all those pretty things (lady)
You've changed my life
And brighther days you've shown me (baby)
You're not alone
My heart is home
Only you have exit

Girl, if you want the sun
Then I'll shine it your way (baby, I'll shine it your way)
And if you want your back rub
Then I'll come right away (I swear I'll come, I'll come, I'll come)
And anything you want from me
Baby, you can have it your way
Ohh... Girl
This is your day

I wanna be where you are
In everything you do (I wanna be right there)
If you pack your bags and go away
I'll have to move where you are
Girl, what I am suppose to do
Got to get through to you
To make you see
With you is where I want to be
Break it down Break it down 112 sing it
Uhh...
Break it down... Yeah, yeah
Uhh...
I wanna be where you are
And everything you do...
112 sing it..

Girl, if you want the sun
Then I'll shine it your way
And if you want your back rub
Then I'll come right away
And anything you want from me
You can have it your way
Ohh... Girl
This is your day.....
