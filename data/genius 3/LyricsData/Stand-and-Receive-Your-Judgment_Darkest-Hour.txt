All their reign falls to the earth just the same
So turn and look the other way
Because you're a failure time and again

And you can try to black it out
Stomp the fire out
Tuck your tail and run
Don't move an inch you war pig fuck
You just stand right there and receive your judgement

All their reign falls to the earth just the same
And even as I waste these words on you and your mock reality
You'll still go down in history, see:
"Stupid spoiled little shit nearly wiped us out"

[Guitar Solo]

And by the time that you realize the damage
You've done you'll be long fucking gone
You coward, you puppet

All their reign falls to the earth just the same
So turn and look the other way
Because you're a failure time and again

And you can try to black it out
Stomp the fire out
Tuck your tail and run
Don't move an inch you war pig fuck
You just stand right there and receive your judgement
