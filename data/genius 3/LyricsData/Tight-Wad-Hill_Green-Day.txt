[Verse 1]
Cheapskate on the hill
A thrill seeker making deals
Sugar city urchin wasting time
Town of lunatics
Begging for another fix
Turning tricks for speedballs
One more night

[Chorus]
Making your rounds once again
Turning up empty handed
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn, tight wad hill

[Verse 2]
Drugstore hooligan
Another white trash mannequin
On display to rot up on the hill
Living out a lie
But having the time of his life
Hating every minute of his existence

[Chorus]
Making your rounds once again
Turning up empty handed
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn, tight wad hill

Making your rounds once again
Turning up empty handed
Bumming a ride
Burning daylight
Last up at dawn, tight wad hill
