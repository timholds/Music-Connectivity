I don’t remember, were we wild and young
All that's faded into memory
I feel like somebody I don’t know
Are we really who we used to be?
Am I really who I was?

The lights will draw you in
And the dark will bring you down
And the night will break your heart
But only if you’re lucky now

Waiting outside while you find your keys
Like bags of trash in the blackening snow
City of neon and toes that freeze
We’ve got nothing and nowhere to go
We’ve got nothing and nowhere

And the lights will draw you in
And the dark will take you down
And the night will break your heart
But only if you’re lucky now

And if the lights will draw you in
And the dark will take you down
And love can mend your heart
But only if you’re lucky now

Ay
Ay
Ay
Ay

I don’t remember, were we wild and young
All that’s faded into memory
I feel like somebody I don't know
Are we really who we used to be?
Am I really who I was?
