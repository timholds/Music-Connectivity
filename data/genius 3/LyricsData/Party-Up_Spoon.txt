By Prince Â©1980 Controversy
Music
(this is way too distorted to
Decipher, but here's the gist of it)
Awwwwww....
We don't give a damn, we just
Wanna party down
Partyup, whoo
Out on your back, and stepping
On a crack
Partyup
Partyup, partyup
Everybody dancing
Playing rock and roll
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Whoooo, etc
I'm Prince, and I rock the
Mic
Anybody gotta quarter?
(okay, so that last line isn't
On there. Sue me.)
