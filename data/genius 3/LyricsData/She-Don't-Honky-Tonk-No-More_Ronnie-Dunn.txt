[Verse 1]
Neon lights once turned her on, whiskey made her crazy
She'd flirt and tease me all night long, like a fiddle, she'd play me
I've seen her drink tequila straight, flat out lose her mind
And party till the break of day, was all fun and good times

[Chorus]
Strait took it home, he almost quit, climbed down off his horse
Jones walked it through those pearly gates, big gold swingin' doors
Right now I could use a shot of somethin' hardcore, that's for sure
She, don't honky tonk no more

[Verse 2]
Man they'd play that neon moon, back and forth we'd sway
We'd live, we'd breathe those cowboy tunes, I still do today
I ain't givin' up at all, I can't turn her loose
Gotta get her back to two-step songs, three chords and the truth

[Chorus]
Strait took it home, he almost quit, climbed down off his horse
Jones walked it through those pearly gates, big gold swingin' doors
Right now I could use a shot of somethin' hardcore, that's for sure
She, don't honky tonk no more

[Chorus]
Strait took it home, he almost quit, climbed down off his horse
Jones walked it through those pearly gates, big gold swingin' doors
Right now I could use a shot of somethin' hardcore, that's for sure
She, don't honky tonk no more

[Outro]
Oh, she, don't honky tonk no more
