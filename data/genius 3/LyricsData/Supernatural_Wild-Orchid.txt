Love like a river
Flowing deeper than time
Rushing over my senses
Like sweet cherry wine
Stole my emotion

Like a thief in the night
Love made me an offer
I couldn't deny
You raise me up until I can't see the ground
Wanna tell this whole world about this love that I found

Supernatural love
You're giving me
Supernatural high
Heaven sent from above
Supernatural love
Oh, supernatural

I'd like to thank you
For changing my world
You made a woman
From a lost little girl

My soul was searching
Searching to find
Something to cherish
A love so divine
I'm hypnotized by feelings I've never felt
It's like your magic put me under a spell

Supernatural love
You're giving me
Supernatural high
Heaven sent from above
Supernatural love
Oh, supernatural

Keep on, keep on giving me
Keep on, keep on giving me
Keep on giving me
Supernatural love
Keep on, keep on giving me
Keep on, keep on giving me
Keep on giving me
Supernatural love

I'm hypnotized by feelings I've never felt
It's like your magic put me under a spell

Supernatural love
You're giving me
Supernatural high
Heaven sent from above
Supernatural love
Oh, supernatural

Lift me up higher, higher and higher
Lift me up higher than I've ever been before
Lift me higher, higher, and higher
With supernatural love

Keep on, keep on giving me
Keep on, keep on giving me
Keep on giving me
Supernatural love

Keep on, keep on giving me
Keep on, keep on giving me
Keep on giving me
Supernatural love

Supernatural love
You're giving me
Supernatural high
Heaven sent from above
Supernatural love
Oh, supernatural
