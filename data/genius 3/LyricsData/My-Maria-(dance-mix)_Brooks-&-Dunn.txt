My Maria
Don't you know I've come a long, long way
I been longin' to see her
When she's around she takes my blues away
Sweet Maria
The sunlight surely hurts my eyes
I'm a lonely dreamer on a highway in the skies

Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Maria I love you)
I love you

My Maria
There were some blue and sorrow times
Just my thoughts about you bring back my piece of mind
Gypsy lady
You're a miracle work for me
You set my soul free like a ship sailing on the sea

She is the sunlight when the skies are grey
She treats me so right lady take me away

My Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Maria I love you)
I love you

My Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Maria I love you)
I love you

My Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Maria I love you)
I love you

My Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Maria I love you)
I love you

My Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Oh my Maria)
Maria (oh Maria I love you girl. Maria I love you)
I love you
