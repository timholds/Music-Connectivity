So alone
And this room feels so cold
No one to care and no one to hold
Yeah, the Lord knows
That I'm needing somebody like you
Just like you

Can you see the passion burning in my eyes?
Do you sense the rush you give my heart
And if you knew the secret way I feel for you
Would you come running to me or would you turn away?

At night I pray
With hope and faith
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray together we will be
And there will come a time

You'll be mine
All mine
And I'll be yours always
But until that day comes
At night I pray

Should I feel these emotions inside me
Should I reveal what's locked up in my soul
I'm so afraid
But it's something that you've got to know

How I want to touch you every time you're near
I long to feel your body next to mine
And if you knew the secret love I have for you
Would you come running to me or would you turn away?

At night I pray
With hope and faith
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray together we will be
And there will come a time

You'll be mine
All mine
And I'll be yours always
But until that day comes
At night I pray

If all my prayers were answered
Our hearts would be enraptured
We would find our heaven inside each other's arms
This lonely room would finally see the sun shine through

But until that day
Every night I'll pray
I'll get down on my knees
I'll get down on my knees and pray...

At night I pray
With hope and faith
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray together we will be
And there will come a time
You'll be mine
All mine

And I'll be yours always
But until that day comes
At night I pray
