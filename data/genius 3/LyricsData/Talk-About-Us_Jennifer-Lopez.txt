[Verse 1]
I saw you and fell in love
You saw me and fell in love, too
You and me, we fell in love with each other last night
I told you I was concerned
You told me of your concerns, too
Yet and still we both decided
To make love last night
Baby, please tell me

[Chorus]
Where do we go from here my love
What are we doing baby
Boy you got to let me know
Why can't we live the way we want
I want the world to know
I just got to let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together
Is what we choose
Oh my love
I think that we should talk
About us

[Verse 2]
Could this be a crazy dream
And if so then you are dreaming too
Because I know for sure that
You feel the same as I do
Could it be that we could be wrong
Even though we are feeling so right
I don't care because I know
That I want you tonight
And I know you want me too

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You see all my live I have waited
Waited all my life
Just to be with someone like you

[Chorus]
