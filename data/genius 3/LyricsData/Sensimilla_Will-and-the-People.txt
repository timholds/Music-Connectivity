I can't feel ya
Your body
Been hitting the sensimilla
With a hot toddy
Lying on my sofa
It's so weedy
Won't you come on over?
Cos I need ya!
And all the lying in the thick of it
And learning not to give a shit
The smiling..
The timing..
And all this late night rhyming...
Well this is the thing..
Should have known you wanted to come over my friend
Won't you come on over again?
Could you get some fags from the shops?
Been recently a bit on the rocks!
I said I can't feel ya
Your body
Been hitting the sensimilla
With a hot toddy
Lying on my sofa
It's so weedy
Won't you come on over?
Cos I need ya!
The misdirection it has got ya
In your little section and it might rot ya
Won't you come on over my friend?
Won't you come on over again?
And all the lying in the thick of it
And learning not to give a shit
The fiddling
The riddling
And listening to when I sing..
But this is the thing..
Should have known you wanted to come over my friend
Won't you come on over again?
And could you get some fags from the shops?
Been recently a bit on the rocks!
Miss Delilah..
You're playing with my hair..
Yeah I try but..
Something is just not there..
Won't you come on over my friend?
And could you buy some fags from the shops?
Won't you come on over my friend
Won't you come on over again?
And could you buy some fags from the shops?
Been recently a bit on the rocks!
Won't you come on over?
Won't you come on over?
Can't sing anymore..
Till I drop (?)
