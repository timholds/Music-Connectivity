It sets in with a vengeance
An attack on all the senses
A paralyzing presence

They'll hunt you down
One at a time
They'll hunt you down
One at a time

The closer they get
There's nowhere to run from the ones with no reflection
Hits when you last expect it
Contagious and spreading it's blessed infection

They'll hunt you down
One at a time
They'll hunt you down
One at a time

The closer they get
There's nowhere to run from the ones with no reflection
Hits when you least expect it
Contagious and spreading it's blessed infection

Defiled with malicious intent
A sickness in your head
A sickness with no end

Somewhere someone holds the cure
Holding out on the rest of us
Blessed and infectious

They'll hunt you down
One at a time
They'll hunt you down
One at a time

The closer they get
There's nowhere to run from the ones with no reflection
Hits when you least expect it
Contagious and spreading it's blessed infection
