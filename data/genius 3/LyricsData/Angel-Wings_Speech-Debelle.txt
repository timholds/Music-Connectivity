Supa dupa high I’m the lord of flies
The bridge that holds the spec in front of my eyes
These words are mine you can try not pay it no mind
But if you paying forward protect with your life
I’m breaking the barriers not here to wasting time
I’m setting the trends its long for waiting in line
Still got my half cup
I been fed up
But now I feed my truths nourish the young cubs
I stay tuned like Korg progressing to a major chord
Depression was the main course stress was the starter
I used to be so angry and hurt with my father
But when my granny died I cried for him and cried for me
And when I hugged he felt human not like a monster
So when I think of him I’m calmer and much maturer
And when I see my brothers and sister I feel like we’re soldiers
Were on the same team we fight the same wars
Got the same scars gotta climb the same walls
Mirror image of me I know my people love me
I feel a tap on my shoulder sometime I know it’s Frenchie
I know these writers and bloggers wanna hate me
Cause I said that I would win they called me arrogant
But missed the fact that I laid out my destiny
So matter what I do in my future can't take away from me
I’m still learning I’m still trying I got my angel wings I ain't afraid of flying

I ain't afraid of flying
I ain't afraid if falling

I keep having recurring dreams it’s the same theme
Always the same cast it’s just a different scene
I’m in elevator keep up but going too fast
Or in a car with some obstacles I can’t get past
I don’t need a doctor to tell me the reason for it
The answer are always stitched in like the seams on it
And so we dream of so I guess we’re living our dreams
So I guess that means our dreams are our reality
But bloggers keep pushing my buttons for controversy
Acting like I’m not human like I ain't got feelings
But where I come from we react we don’t run
So anyone who thinks I take that is so wrong
Know my battles ain't with myself they with everyone else
We are soldiers the wars never cease
It’s just now always got fresh kicks in feet
And money in the bank
God knows I deserve it
I put my heart in this and shared it with the public
Never told you no lies never acted like I was perfect
I will not live a hermit
And we afraid of no journalist
We are og’s we ain't afraid of no police
Used to put in work pumping 2Pac Makaveli
Now I fine dine 5 course and I fill my belly
I sip on Sancerre and look at what I done already
I’m so proud I’ll climb a mountain and shout
And I’ll never throw in the towel I’ll never throw in the towel, yo
I’m still learning I’m still trying I got my angel wings I ain't afraid of flying
