I was a little boy
I had a little pup
He ran out into the street
Never came back to me
I cried, cried myself to sleep at night
Cried, cried myself to sleep at night

There was this man I knew
He came to move in with us
He took all my youth away
He's taken my mother away
Cried, cried myself to sleep at night
Cried, cried myself to sleep at night
Cried, cried myself to sleep at night
