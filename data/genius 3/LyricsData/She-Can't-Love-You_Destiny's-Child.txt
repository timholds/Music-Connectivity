[Verse: Beyoncé]
I saw your new girlfriend the other day
And I expected for her to be so much more than she was
I checked out her style
The way she smiled
The way she moved
The things she said
The way she looked at me like, "I got yo man"

[1:]
(She can't love you) like I can
All of her love just can't compare to what I have
(She can't touch you) like I do
'Cause when y'all touching
You pretend it's me and you

[Chorus:]
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time

[Verse: Beyoncé]
When we were together
You told me what you didn't like
And you went out and got exactly that type
Except that your new girl is nothing compared to me
Everything that she did wrong I always do right

[2:]
(She can't hold) you like I can
Boy you a fool if you can't realize what you had
(She can't feel you) like I can
Cause I'm a girl that's always standing by my man

[Chorus:]
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time

[Bridge: Kelly]
There's no way, there's no way
That her love could be could be good as mine
There's no reason, no reason
For you to even go and waste your time
Your time

[Chorus:]
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time
And there's no way
Her love's as good as mine
There's no reason for you to waste your time
