Mmmm.. gimme concentration

I'm a lotto boy and I need allot of -vation

(Sippin on some brown liquor yeh)
(Baby when I'm drunk I can't be around u)
(I'm gonna need to come down a notch)
(Show you things that I'm gone doooo) ah

Wa wa wild thoughts
Wa wa wa
When I'm with you all i get is wild thoughts
Wa wa waaaaa
When I'm with you all i get is ......



You know I love it when your nasty
Pick u up yeh , take it to the back seat

Little mah  I know ur classy
Freaky for me I won't tell anybodddy

Little mama show me how you work ehh

You know you better come sicka work ehh

Cause once I get the tea 'n' squeeze 'n' please 'n' baby

Nobody gonna know from is from work ehh

Cause once we come and ride for a little bit
I'll put you on the top for a little bit

I know that you get  wild wild thoughts

And your the only one I'll do yeh babyy
