[Verse 1]
Where is her dinner?
Where are the flowers she can press?
When will she leave here?
Been here for hours and no less
Please leave me here in the empty world

[Verse 2]
Where is my mother?
Will she be there when I am gone?
Fetal in turmoil
I can't afford another run
Needle and tinfoil
I never thought that I'd be done

[Chorus]
Please leave me here in the empty world
Fall in love with the empty girl
If I go outside I'll feel much better
Let me hit myself I'm starting to feel

[Outro]
And bleed
And bleed
Where is my brother?
Where is my father?
Please leave me here in the empty world
Fall in love with the empty girl
