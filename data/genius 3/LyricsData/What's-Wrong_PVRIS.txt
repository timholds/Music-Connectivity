[Intro]
Don't need a metaphor

Woooh
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, woah
Woah, woah
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, woah
Woah, woah

[Verse 1]
Two years gone
Came back as some bones and so cynical
This skin don't feel like home
It's all overgrown but you'll never know
Take the mirror from the wall so I can't see myself at all
Don't wanna see another damn inch of my skull
Forget the poems of saints and ghosts
I'm the one I fear the most
Little did I know that I was only crying wolf

[Chorus]
I know it's so wrong but I'm so far gone
Don't need you to tell me I'm so cynical
Quit being so over-skeptical
Don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable
I don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable

[Verse 2]
Push and pull
Oh, it's all getting old
No I didn't want this throne
Only fools make feasts of gold
They rot the fruit on tables

[Pre-Chorus]
When did I get so pitiful
Just a goddamn corpse in a centerfold
You got my back against the wall
And now I can't ever get comfortable
No I never sold my soul
If I ever do throw my bones to the wolves
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold mine

[Chorus]
I know it's so wrong but I'm so far gone
Don't need you to tell me I'm so cynical
Quit being so over-skeptical
Don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable
I don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable

[Pre-Chorus]
When did I get so pitiful?
Just a god damn corpse in a center fold
You've got your back against the wall
Now I can never get comfortable
No I never sold my soul
If I ever do throw my bones to the wolves
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my

[Chorus]
I know it's so wrong but I'm so far gone
Don't need you to tell me I'm so cynical
Quit being so over-skeptical
Don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable
I don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable

[Bridge]
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my soul
No I never sold my

[Chorus]
I know it's so wrong but I'm so far gone
Don't need you to tell me I'm so cynical
Quit being so over-skeptical
Don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable
I don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable
I don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable
