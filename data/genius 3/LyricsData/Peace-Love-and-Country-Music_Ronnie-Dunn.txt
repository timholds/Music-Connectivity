[Chorus]
Peace love and country music
Lord we could sure use some more
Peace love and country music
Simple things worth fighting for
We need them like never before

[Verse 1]
I’m not a man who has all the answers
Sure don’t know what it all means
Every night I kneel down by my bedside
I pray for three things

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Every day I’m humbled and thankful
For the things the good lord has done
I know some people are hurting
So we sing for less fortunate ones

[Chorus][x3]
