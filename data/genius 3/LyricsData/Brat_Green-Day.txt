[Verse 1]
Mom and dad dont look so hot these days
They're getting over the hill
Death is closing in and catching up
As far as I can tell
Got a plan of action and cold blood
And it smells of defiance
I'll just wait for mom and dad to die and get my inheritance

[Chorus]
Well, now I want more
'Cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
But it's all figured out
Well, nothing good can last

[Verse 2]
Crow's feet and rot are setting in
And time is running out
My parent's income interest rate
Is gaining higher clout
I'm a snot-nosed slob without a job
And I know I damn well should
Mom and dad don't look so hot these days
But my future's looking good

[Chorus]
Well, now I want more
'Cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
But it's all figured out
Well, nothing good can last

[Chorus]
Well, now I want more
'Cause I'm getting bored
And I'm going nowhere fast
I was once filled with doubt
But it's all figured out
Well, nothing good can last
