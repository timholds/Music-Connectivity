[Verse 1 - will.i.am]
Right now...
Right now is the right time, for the good things in life
Let's celebrate, let's bring upon the better times
And let the sadder time disappear
Ohhh, I feel like a champion, in the stadium
There's love and pandemonium
I'ma put this in my memory
As the best time ever

[Hook - Fergie]
This is the best one yet.. and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget?
This is the best one, this is the best one
This is the best one yet.. and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget?
This is the best one, this is the best one
This is the best one yet

[Verse 2 - will.i.am]
Let's celebrate
Let's do it right now and not hesitate
We gonna rock it to the top like elevate
Bottoms up, here we go, let's intoxicate
I was feeling good but now I'm feelin gr-gr-gr-great
Best ever, and no I don't exaggerate
This moment is a moment I'll appreciate
Today is the day I, will remember

[Hook - Fergie]
This is the best one yet.. and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget?
This is the best one, this is the best one
This is the best one yet.. and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget?
This is the best one, this is the best one
This is the best one yet

[Verse 3 - The Black Eyed Peas]
Let's celebrate...
Let's celebrate...
This is your moment, this is your moment
This is the time, this is the time
To get it right tonight, to get it right
You don't want to let the moment pass you by
So c'mon and take this one in a photograph
Everything that made us cry, and made us laugh
The night's young and we raise our glass
We'll make it count like the best one we ever had
The best one yet, the best one yet
This is the best one yet, the best one yet
The best one yet, the best one yet
Ohh-wee-ohhh

[Hook - Fergie]
This is the best one yet.. and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget?
This is the best one, this is the best one
This is the best one yet.. and I'm so happy
How could we ever forget?
This is the best one, this is the best one
This is the best one yet

[Outro - will.i.am]
Let's celebrate...
