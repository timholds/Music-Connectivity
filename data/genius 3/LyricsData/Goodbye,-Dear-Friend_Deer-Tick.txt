[Instrumental Intro]

[Verse 1]
Some roads that you take
Some bonds will choose to break
And I swore I'd no longer be
The pallbearer
But I carried you to bed
So you could rest your head
You were taking off a load
Heavy drinkin'

[Verse 2]
The world it carries on
Your memories in songs
And your pictures on my wall
Are not forgotten
There was hymns that came from mouths
That turned crosses upside down
But it came through their teeth
With great ease

[Chorus]
And all are bobbing heads in sync
And all have got a lot on their minds to think about
But you, you carry on
In pictures and in songs
And the unmade bed you slept in
Where I laid you down to rest one last time
Goodbye, dear friend
Goodbye, dear friend

[Verse 3]
Some stories break your heart
And some with such applaud
Buried deep inside
Where it's ok to cry
Some boys won't shed a tear
Oh, but a tale like this here
It can break down and get me
Where it hurts the most

[Chorus]
And all are bobbing heads in sync
And all have got a lot on their minds to think about
But you, you carry on
In pictures and in songs
And the unmade bed you slept in
Where I laid you down to rest one last time
Goodbye, dear friend
Goodbye, dear friend

[Outro]
But you carry on
In pictures and in songs
And the unmade bed you slept in
Where I laid you down to rest one last time
Goodbye, dear friend
Goodbye, dear friend
