[Verse 1: Big Pooh]
What up brown skin, you're body smellin' like cinnamon
Hair in a bun, your toes done so feminine
Heard you suck your teeth like, oh no here we go again
Let me get your name so I can be more genuine
No need to front, the kid knows you got many friends
Many mens who waitin' to stake a claim on it
Put they name down just to spit some game on it
But fuck friends I'm tryna set the mood
You know, go at you hard like most records that's sold
Spit propaganda at you to you break down and fold
You look confused miss thing like I'm speakin' in code
76-64 press pound hello
Are you listenin' now, did I get your attention
Undivided because you used to be undecided
Now you looking fluxed like those chicks with they nose stuck up
Just put your number down girl what the fuck

[Refrain]
Hey yo that's alright girl, whatever you say
Whatever you say, whatever you say
Yo that's alright girl, whatever you say
Whatever you say, whatever you say
Don't worry bout it girl, whatever you say
Whatever you say, whatever you say
Ok alright, what ever you say
Whatever you say, whatever you say

[Verse 2: Phonte]
I usually play the background, you know clean cut
Soft spoken, well dressed, dipped out straight chillin'
When I'm in the club yo, sippin' the Sprite with the
Ill lemon mixed in it sippin' on it I was just chillin'
Til I saw you, that's when my heart stopped knees gave
Head sweatin' jaws locked I was sweating you
Like god damn girl you got a nigga going buck wild
Mesmerized star struck I was thinking maybe
We can go out like to the movies or the Applebees
Blockbuster state fair but you looked at me and
Said fuck that you just a herb with no money and
No jeep and no condo and I thought that Little Brother
Had a record deal, ok I see where you going now
Want a sweat a nigga when you think he got a cash advance
And some personal time but fuck that
I got your head still bobbin' and my verse didn't rhyme
So it's what ever girl

[Refrain]

[Verse 3]
[Big Pooh]
Check it so what I'm chubby, y'all chicks still love me
Like to rub on my tummy while I tell you somethin' funny
Whisper in your ear 'til them panties go fallin'
What's my name (Big Pooh) yea that's what she be callin'

[Phonte]
Oh yea I know I'm husky but chicks still love me
Three o'clock still have they ass running to Waffle House fa me
Be feelin' on that ass till my name they be calling and shit
Get 'em so wet they make a Freudian slip and
Fall down into my verbal abyss that's straight Reservoir
Dog style perfecto served with a kiss

[Big Pooh]
Muah baby, it's just like this no need to fight it
Invite it try me out you just might like it
American pie shit try anything out once
Forever stained your memory like white shirts and punch
I get the hunch that a nigga's on your menu
Do me a favor girl come check me at the next venue

[Outro]

[Phonte]
Hey yo Big Pooh check this out
You go to your girls' house and I'm a go to mine
Cause I know my girl is definitely mad
Cause it took us too long to do this album

[Big Pooh]
Yo I hear what you saying
Lets just pump the music up and count our money

[Phonte]
Hey you well check this out
Yo 9th turn the bass down and
Just let the beat keep on rockin

[Big Pooh]
And we out of here

[Phonte]
Yo what happened to peace

[Big Pooh & Phonte]
Peace
