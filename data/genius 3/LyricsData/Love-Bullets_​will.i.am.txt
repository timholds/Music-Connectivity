[Verse 1: Skylar  and will.i.am]
Love will be the armor
Protect us from the pain
End our life, end our life
Even when the storm comes
We’ll stand out in the rain
Watch it slide, leave this life.

[Pre-Hook: Both]
Here we stand against the world

[Hook: will.i.am]
You and I we rock the lullaby
Make me feel alive, cause the love will never die
Me put you long one
Shot me down and we’re gone
Ain’t no need to worry, don’t call 911
Bang-bang, a lot of bang-bang
Shoot me with your love and got me feeling no pain
Kill it, kill it baby with your loving, bang bang
Baby, do it again

[Chorus: Skylar and will.i.am]
So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet

[Post-Chorus: Both]
Even if you’re mad at me
And fighting all the time
It’s alright, it’s alright
I would risk my sanity
I would lose my mind
For one night, for one night

[Pre-Hook: Both]
Here we stand against the world

[Hook: will.i.am]
You and I we rock the lullaby
Make me feel alive, cause the love will never die
Me put you long one
Shot me down and we’re gone
Ain’t no need to worry, don’t call 911
Bang-bang, a lot of bang-bang
Shoot me with your love and got me feeling no pain
Got me feeling lovely like it's morphine, baby, baby
Baby, do it again

[Chorus: Skylar and will.i.am]
So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
