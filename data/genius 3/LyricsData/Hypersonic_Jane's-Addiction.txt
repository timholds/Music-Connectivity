Yeah, I got a ticket to ride for two
I'm going up to the wild blue
I keep the surface ultra cooled
And all my fuel can be renewed

While we wait around with delay
The sudden news is just fast-talking
Your skin is oily, your story's old
So tell it while your walking

We're flying
Hypersonic
Flying
With my hyper tonic

Yeah, I all uproot you terrorist
I am the guide to the perplexed
Man take this tip, I'm gonna win
I'll put it all on hydrogen

'cause our lives have gotten tied
To people we should untangle
It's all at a fatal cost
To keep us over barrels

We are flying
Hypersonic
Flying
With my hyper tonic

We got time we're doing fine
With mach 8 acceleration
The sky is clear don't interfere with
With aspirations of this nation

Ah, shoot new cities into space
Drag you at the new space races!
Fast as a line can flow
And look around
We leave no traces

We are flying
Hypersonic
Flying
With my hyper tonic
Ahoo, yeah
Flying
Hypersonic
We're flying
With my hyper tonic
