[Hell Rell]
I got the metal pa', that's how I settle dram (drama)
Eyes "Jet Li" but I'm Afro-Ameri-can
I got a foreign bitch, sitting in the foreign whip
She don't speak English but she know how to slob a dick
Wrist crazy, neck retarded....yeah I'm flossing hard
Stepped my weight up, gave my own boss a job!
Yellow diamonds, looking like moron cars
Lawyer got in the ring what them cases afford 'em hard
Yeah he kept it real in jail, he a livewire
Hell Rell? That's the homey, official 5 rider
I'm the talk in all the hood's and every Barbershop
They say that boy go hard every bar is hot
So smoke ya haze cocksucker, take ya last drag
You about to die homo and you past fag
Crumble up ya rhymes, shoot 'em in the trash bag
AK's and bombs, my niggas hood is Baghdad! (Weeks Block)
Now you see me in ya TV, stranger
And ya favorite rappers got me in his CD changer
I'm a general nigga, send ya greatest soldier
Uzi on the tour bus, please don't pull us over
I got weight, you need yay? I'm there
And ya bitch mad I won't let her braid my hair
I'm bout to cut that shit anyway, fuck that bitch anyway
Feds raided the spot, got another strip anyway
