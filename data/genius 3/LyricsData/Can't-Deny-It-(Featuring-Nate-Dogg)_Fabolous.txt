Yo, yo, if they want it, cowards get it
They still wonder how I did it
Now y'all wit it, these niggas see how I spit it
Huh, these bitches see how I kit it
You can hear my coupe a block away
Bitches be yellin', "Let Me Ride" like they Snoop and Dr. Dre
I keep spittin', them clips copped on those calicoes
Keep shittin', with zip locks of that Cali dro'
Keep hittin' and shift blocks for that Cali dough
Keep gettin', my tip rocked by them Cali hoes
It's William Bonnie, stealin' mamis

In V.I.P, with buckets of chilled Cris'
Click, click, who the fuck wanna feel this

That can make it feel like the block's movin'
My 6-4's, wit the wheels and the shocks movin'
Them boys in blue with the shields and the Glocks movin'
You can't deny it, I'm the same ol' G
The Guc' frames got the same gold G

The fat bitch stood up, just stood up
She 'bout to be steamin', turn it up
You won't hear a thang no you won't
You too busy sleepin', won't wake up
You can't deny it
The kid pull the four out a little quicker
You might end up the reason, ya homies
Will have to pour out a little liquor
Every stack that a draws out a little thicker
I get brain, kick the whores out a little quicker
You kids rap that's cool
But the kid's wrapped in jewels, the kid clapped that tool
Kidnap that fool, you don't wanna wake up gettin' told
That ya kids trapped at school
When the time's right, I'ma put this nine right
To the left side of ya head, push ya mind right
It's still nothin' but a G thang, I thought you knew
And I'm 'bout to do the numbers that they thought you do
Still don't know me, still jump in a Lex
The chain so icy, I got chill bumps on my neck
The Narcs heard, how the krills pump in the jet
Still bumpin' ya dex, still dumpin' the tec, still
Y'all can't deny it, I'm a fuckin' rider
