Continued the waiting
Tearing at the wing
I lost a friend
A terrible plaything
Broken on a swing
I lost a friend
Kept boxes of old days
When you were afraid

Alone and nothing
Thought I had something
To ease the pain of hurting you
I just can't take this
Although I've made this
The evening that I'm moving through

Forever to find you
Severing the new
I lost a friend
I wanted to wake you
Someone that I knew

Don't even know you
Can I go with you?
Can't say I need anything
Love this depression
Another session
There's nothing more that I can bring

I am writing this down
I have never lived before

Slow motion sickness
Why should I fix this?
Shaken by the sight of me
The painted babies
And run late ladies
Brought out a different side of me

I am writing this down
I have never lived before

Sometimes I don't feel so good
