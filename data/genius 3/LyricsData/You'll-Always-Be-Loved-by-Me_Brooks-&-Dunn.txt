[Verse 1]
I know forever is a long long time
For a girl to put her heart on the line
Trust is a tight rope we all have to walk
Baby don't be afraid I won't let you fall
With a little faith mountains move
You and me we can't lose

[Chorus]
You can count on the sun to rise
And stars to come out at night
As long as there's air to breathe
You'll always be loved by me

[Verse 2]
Love comes so many times goes
So much out there we'll never know
Call it fate call it destiny
But I think we were meant to be
This old world it spins so fast
So many times they just don't last

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
You'll always be loved by me
