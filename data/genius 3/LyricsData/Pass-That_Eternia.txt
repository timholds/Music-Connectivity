[Verse One]:
When I was ten I prayed to God I wouldn't sin again
Raced around the church walls like a flowerbed
Too aware for my age of what the pastor said
Bred guilt in me, yep, for every time he'd break the bread
My mother on her knees for hours dyin' to repent
Tryin' to make sure we don't end up where our father went
Or we'll go to Hell to burn slow
My father the apostle if you ask him though, whoa
Yep, that's right, he got a saint for a wife
More than he bargained for, he's livin' in the street life
And opposites attract like bugs to streetlights
He was like, "She knew the rules and broke 'em like headlights"
Aight, so one plus one, that equals three babies
One pops that's crazy, one church lady
One restraining order, one shotgun, and maybe or not
We got a riot on our hands with the cops
And that's when I'd pop up, the strip locks down
My mother would run for cover with her brother outta town
My God the only father I got that hold me down
So I kneel beside the bed and pray every night now

[Hook]:
Hop, break, roll, pass
Hop, break, roll, pass
Hop, break, roll, pass
Hop, break, roll, pass
Pass the bling, pass the buck, pass that

[Verse Two]:
She wake up every morning like it was her last
Passed on the breakfast, pass the peter flask
Pass that she wanna escape like quick fast
Had an uncle with hands that passed through her underpants
She pass on class with boys harass for ass
She'd rather hang out by gas stations for the cash
Pass time went from gym to gym to crack
Any last resort she'll get her hands on that
And the classmates laugh and ask her why she's so fast
She pass 'em like she don't hear 'em yap behind her back
16 little thing layin' on her back
She figure they gonna take so why not pay for that
They finance everything she need to relax
A relapse, an overdose, trip an ambulance
The doctor's send her back to mom where she slack
Her momma too busy runnin' that double shift, dad
Her pops she only know from pictures in the glass
Her younger sister found her dead in her bed where she had passed
Cause

[Hook]:
Hop, break, roll, pass
Hop, break, roll, pass
Hop, break, roll, pass
Hop, break, roll, pass
Pass the bling, pass the buck, pass that

When you say you're born poor, born last
That's the pass
You blame your mom your brother and dad
That's the pass
You say you ain't never had a chance
That's the pass
Pass the bling, pass the buck, pass that
When you say you're set up to come last
That's the pass
Left your fam, dropped class
That's the pass
Say that you was given the shaft
That's the pass
Pass the bling, pass the buck, pass that
