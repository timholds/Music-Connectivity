[Hook: Belly]
We are not the same i'm too aggressive
I might twist yo bitch up like a pretzel
Used to keep the chickens in the Lexus
And run 'em up the block like i'm Precious

[Verse 1: Belly]
I remember when I used to call you'd never call me back
So I used to call you bitch and say your heart is black (bitch)
But every time you would call there was a heart attack
Shoulda figured fall is back, the summer had you fallin' back
Now i'm dressin' all in black, bitch we started that
Coulda had you back, probably thought of that
In the club, in the back, where the ballers at?
Quarterback, lil nigga where the water at?
I used to dream about pretty girls, enormous homes (it's true)
Got some shit with ten rooms and felt more alone
Brought the baking soda and pots, i'm more at home
I'm what the future sounds like, dog tomorrow's on
Just a kid from the warzone, the cornerstone
To buildin' an empire up from the cornerstones
I swear I felt more alive when I was dead broke (yeah)
Remember when I fucked your bitch until the bed broke?
Right stroke, left stroke, what's the best stroke (uh)
XO niggas had you switchin' up your dress code
I ain't fuckin' finished, i'm on another planet
Shout my fuckin' chemist
I let you know when i'm ready so please don't throw confetti
Wait, you tried to go and tell your friends but they know already
They fuckin' know already, yeah

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it (About it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill
(Life so trill)
(Life so trill)
(Life so trill)
