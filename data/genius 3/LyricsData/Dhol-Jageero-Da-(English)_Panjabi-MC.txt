The drum of Jageero (Jageero is a name of a girl)
The drum of Jageero kicks off a row (or kicks up a furor)
People are watching
People are watching with amazement
The drum of Jageero
When she stands on the stage and beats her drum
Everyone is doing Bhangra together (Bhangra is the folk dance of Punjab)
Everyone is saying that she is really good at this
On seeing the dhol they are getting amazed
Girls have learn to beat the drum
Now friends, tell me what will become of boys
The drum of Jageero

Balle O Balle (just a slang in Punjabi language
It is used to say yes yes or Very Good)
This fairy looks more beautiful than any other fairy
When she beats the drum
She looks at boys with a mischevious eye
And she is showing affection
The beauty of this Punjabi girl spills
When bhangra is going into the heart
The drum of Jageero

She dances really good when she beats the dhol
And she moves like a snake
She is in intoxication of her blossoming youth
She is defeating everyone
She doubled over while she was standing
Then Jageero put her drum stick on the ground
