[Hook/Verse: PW]
Yeah, I swear I'm the shit, I swear I'm the shit
Yeah, I'm feeling myself, I swear I'm that nigga
Tell 'em light up the ting, tell 'em light up the ting
Nigga, I don't even smoke, yet I'm burning shit down
Said I'm burning shit down and I ride through my ends
With my old school friends, middle finger to the industry
Look what it did to me, ain't seen my gran in a month
I've been grinding all month, man, I feel like shit
Ain't seen my gran in a month
I've been grinding all month, man, I feel like shit

Picked up where I left off, think I threw up cause I went pop
I swear that shit-

(Oi Tefs, what have you- what have you got bunning in there, cuz? Might haffi come out and inhale the fumes real quick before I zone out on this ting)

[Verse 1: Mercston]
Biggest fan, niggas forgot they were my biggest fan
Scorcher had to use that line to make 'em simmer down
I could put your woman in labour like Ed Miliband
Bang! Oh, let me shoot 'em down
They don't understand, I'm the main man and a middleman, yeah
Tryna get my hands dem dirty, I'm nearly thirty
But they're filthy when I ain't been around
Now I'm back like Arnie
New car key, probably bent over your auntie
Mi know she want me, I don't mean to blow my own horn
But I taught these niggas swag when I was [?]
They was in the stoneys, these times I had my own jewels
[?] man I should've had a gold tooth, oof
Remember chilling right outside the Bow North
'05 I probably started to go north
Linked Scorcher [?]
On my mother's life, was 'bout to kill it independent
Would've signed first if it wasn't for the sentence
Whole sentence (I swear I'm the shit, I swear I'm the shit)
Let me carry on though
I'm happy, god though, my nigga, fuck a bando
I'm in a yard with 50 bars, my nigga, fuck the landlord
Tight shorts, fitted shirt, I'm moving international
When I wrote "Good Old Days", they were penning 8s
I was buying champs, they was sipping on lemonade
Black tracky in the summer niggas, mate
Someone tell 'em cool off in the shade, sick

[Verse 2: Youngs Teflon]
Older guys on the ends used to send me
Till they shot, now them old Gs bred me
I spend a bag on a tee, I'm Jimmy Tetley
I ain't a killer cause I missed, call me Heskey
I've seen the realest come and go, I've seen plenty
I've seen the ting slide back when it's empty
Got the Kenco, man have got the Nestle
I'm a crook so you know you can't finesse me
See, I can be a lad, same time be a banger
Slapped my young boy cause he ain't got no manners
Had to link the dread cuh he sold me a jammer
The squad been rough since I was doing Anna
Them man are doing loads, same time doing nothing
(Now what you saying?) You must be bluffing
No prescription glasses when I'm trapping, I'm a boffin
I really love my friends but same time I've gotta watch 'em
Bitch from up north let me pull it in her mouth
Said pull a G-string where I'm from down south
Mummy always said "no smoke in the house"
She ain't know I hid my chrome in the couch
Raised well but I roll like the son of a jerk
Made a chick drive, got her turning the Mercs
Smooth criminal, I'mma mark with a clerk
I'm an all-star, I put the con in the verse, work

[Verse 3: Scorcher]
If you don't know me and you're from the ends, you ain't got your stamp yet
You're playing in the waterfall and you ain't got your hands wet
Man's spraying on grime, I rate him, it's fine
But this a full clip spitting out a MAC-10, I press it and pop
When I'm about, you ain't never the boss
These little dickheads have got memory loss, don't make me jog 'em
Man talking all that crud, don't let me wash 'em
And bottom line, you could get a coffin
Brudda was the forefather, alpha and omega flow
Started, then I ended it, been at levels you never go
I keep a metal on a nigga anywhere I go
Because the ends love a nigga but you never know
Cuh couple niggas don't like me and I can understand it
I rap rings round niggas, I'm on another planet
Sitting on something while I'm whipping up another pattern
I disappear, come back, and still I'm fucking savage
I hate to blow my own trumpet
The best in the ends and I ain't really with the buck shit
I've never been a snitch and we don't need to switch subject
And brudda, I ain't flinching, I ain't budged yet
I ain't seen a landscape switch up, whoa, niggas start to bitch up
I just kicked the shit out the riddim, [?] flick up
I took a little trip for a minute, it was a hiccough
And-

[Verse 4: Avelino]
I swear I'm the shit, nigga
I give anything but a shit, nigga
Yeah, S-line, that's a lisp, nigga
I kept my chin up, now my bitch is in a chinchilla
Got a gang of hoes for the whole gang
Cause you knew me, that doesn't mean you know man
There's a new me that doesn't even know man
I'm grinding on my Js, hush, I'm getting mo' stacks
Too much money ain't enough
I love making nigga making love
I'm still singing along to Ma$e and Puff
I'm tryna make a drink while they get drunk
Tell the DJ spin the song and tell these rappers they'll get spun
Fuck you mean, this ain't hit date?
Watch and share, that's the flick of the same wrist
Hard work and talent, what's the difference? The same thing
A... V
Yeah

[Outro: PW]
I swear I'm the shit
I swear I'm the shit
I swear I'm the shit
I swear I'm the shit
Middle finger to the industry, look what it did to me
