Wake up, the house is on fire
And the cat's caught in the dryer
Philosophy's a liar when your home is your headstone
"Icon" is the last chance for hope
When there's no such thing as heroes
Your faith lies in the ditch that you dug yourself in

[Pre-Chorus]
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down

[Chorus]
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

Christmas lights in the middle of August
Grudges come back to haunt us
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies
Grounded in a duplex to find
That you're living on a landmine
Vacation hotspots is a cemetery drive

[Pre-Chorus]
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down

[Chorus]
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When the lights are going down

[Chorus]
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

Last chance to piss it all away
Nothing but hell to pay
When all you wanna do
Is not to give up

[Chorus]
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

[Chorus]
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone

[Chorus]
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Celebrate your own decay
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
On a noose over your home
Oh, deadbeat holiday
Get on your knees and pray
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high
But at least you're not alone
