Lay face down in my bed
It feel remote
As the acid rises up
From my stomach to my throat
Face seems gray and vacant
Body soft and weak
And any signs of life
Have long since disappeared
So i guess ill have another
Replenish my energy
A few hours i'll feel OK
And then watch the day repeat
Guess i'll have another (11x)
