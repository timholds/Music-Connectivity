[Pre-Chorus: Ash]
Baby gyal you must bang juju
You disappear my frustration
Take time when you whine my boo-boo
Before I get let me taste you
Borrow me your behind
Shawty got me spending money on a sweet whine (ohh)
I don't wanna start with you
Come on, let me tell you and finish my food

[Chorus: Ash]
And that's why
You're my plantain and dumplin, so let me plant in your something
You're my plantain and dumplin, so let me plant in your something
You're my plantain and dumplin, so let me plant in your something
And I don't wanna start with you
Come on, let me tell you and finish my food

[Verse 1: Lucas]
See that's my bae yeah, I like the way you misbehave on me
Best I ever had it ya, so baby come and fill your glass with me
You got me wasted
See your body is rotating
Baby, I can put you through your paces
I don't really mind what your race is
I'm a young fly boy from Jamaica
Moneymaker, get this paper, never catch me sippin' whole one in the chamber
She got a haircut, even my brother they rate her
Yah yah yah yo, yah yah yah yo
Baby you so possible (yah yo)
We are so compatible (yah yo)
This is so unstoppable
Yah yah yah yo, yah yah yah yo

[Bridge: Ash]
Baby gyal you must bang juju
You disappear ma shu shu
Take time when you whine my boo-boo
Before I get let me taste you
Borrow me your behind
Shawty got me spending money on a sweet whine (ohh)
I don't wanna start with you
Come on, let me tell you and finish my food

[Chorus: Ash]
And that's why
You're my plantain and dumplin, so let me plant in your something
You're my plantain and dumplin, so let me plant in your something
You're my plantain and dumplin, so let me plant in your something
And I don't wanna start with you
Come on, let me tell you and finish my food

[Verse 2: Ash]
And that's why
Lie by nature, Leo by birth
Come give me water, come and free up my thirst
Baby, I can never see yah, but I need yah
A portion of you is never enough
When you look when your walking, your bum looks contoured
The way your whining with your friends, make me notice for sure
Ah, my breakfast, my long Sunday dinner
My blackberry sweet Ribena
Girl your sick, then come and give me fever
Girl I want you for me
But sometimes baby you gotta do it on your own
I will give you hoody when I'm home
See you sippin' Henny when wohhhh wohhhh

[Bridge: Ash]
Baby gyal you must bang juju
You disappear ma shu shu
Take time when you whine my boo-boo
Before I get let me taste you
Borrow me your behind
Shawty got me spending money on a sweet whine (ohh)
I don't wanna start with you
Come on, let me tell you and finish my food

[Chorus: Ash]
And that's why...
You're my plantain and dumplin, so let me plant in your something
You're my plantain and dumplin, so let me plant in your something
You're my plantain and dumplin, so let me plant in your something
And I don't wanna start with you
Come on, let me tell you and finish my food

[Outro: Ash]
And that's why
You're my plantain and dumplin, so let me plant in you something
You're my plantain and dumplin, so let me plant in you something
And I don't wanna start with, and I don't start with you
