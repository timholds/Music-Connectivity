[Verse 1]
Dig your teeth into my neck
It’s alright
I taught you everything that you know
Be like a river opening up
It’s your life
With the seeds that you sow
Crawl your way back to me
We’re thicker than thieves, we're family

[Chorus]
Some things never change
I’ll just look the other way
Let you sort it out yourself
I can always tell when you’re upside down or upside in
Thinking about what might have been
There’s nothing left to say
We all stay the same
Some things never change

[Verse 2]
Pray to the Gods in heavens, for your light
Time will destroy everything you know
Shed every ounce of your skin, it’s alright
You are never alone
Break the promise you made
I've done the same, we'll do it again

[Chorus]
Some things never change
I’ll just look the other way
Let you sort it out yourself
I can always tell when you’re upside down or upside in
Thinking about what might have been
Can't you turn the page?
Some things never change

[Bridge]
I walk with you
Just like a shadow
Just like a shadow
I fight for you
I will fight your battle
Will fight your battle

[Chorus]
Some things never change
I’ll just look the other way
Let you sort it out yourself
I can always tell when you’re upside down or upside in
Thinking about what might have been
There’s nothing left to say
We all stay the same
Some things never change
