[Verse 1]
Some girls go to church on Sunday
Live life by the golden rule
You got girls going to graduate one day
Suma cum laude from party school

[Chorus]
Some they walk the straight and narrow
Some girls they just don't care
Good girls go to heaven
Bad girls go everywhere

[Verse 2]
Some girls are into heavy metal
Dance with the devil everywhere they go
Others of 'em cut a rug to the fiddle
Dance to the rhythm of the cotton eyed Joe

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Miss high fulluting likes to sip fine champagne
Prim and proper dripping in diamond rings
Little sister wears high heals and blue jeans
A long neck drinking certified wild thing

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Good girls go to heaven bad girls go everywhere
