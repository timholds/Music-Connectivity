No corre hermana no corre ahorra

She a beautiful girl but was never told so
Chilling in soho appealing to those folk
Who only wanna use her amuse her to get into her
Cause she never made love but she know how to fuck
Often mistake trust under guise of lust
Afraid of her reflection her appearance reflect in
A couple shots before they ingested
To drown her liver can't walk right cause her soles disfigured
Never got delivered/ u flying but dove can't wash sins away
Within this place intend to prey
But when she close her eyes predators in her face
Try to find purity in white lines for light times
Gave her snake eyes so she roll low when the dice flies
Slow suicide she just foolish ride
Doors to her treasure always move aside
With fake compliments don't debate consequence
Or use common sense like pennies cause of her pompousness
Keep running but end up at the same place
Life's cunning find a compass within faith

You can't run from your self forever
You can't run from your fears
Run to all those things that feel better
Just so love will feel near (2)

No corre negrito no corre ahorra

Home broken and his heart cold
Ran the streets to find peace and found a dark home
Caught a record cause he runnin to fast
Cutting class like he ghetto just to touch on some ass
He kinda gassed his aggression stem from depression
He question life but never been corrected compassion lessened
Smoking reefer to cut the tension
No AC in his home so he always venting
Development arrested so he got a couple warrants
To many ignored him the truth never occurring
Cage him like an animal since he earned his stripes
Exhausted those around him smoke to many pipes
Nothing to do ain't no opportunity
Don't act frugally death in his community
Joined a gang to gain up in the game
Try to wheel his self to more but he lost his frame
Wanna take action like he shooting a film
But when pockets contracting do whats suiting to him
Until he use the pain as a platform
Won't lock him behind walls they'll be hanging plaques for him

El amor esta en dios no corra mas no corra mas(2)

Chorus (2)

El amor esta en dios no corra mas no corra mas (2)

No corre no puedes correr siempre mi gente
