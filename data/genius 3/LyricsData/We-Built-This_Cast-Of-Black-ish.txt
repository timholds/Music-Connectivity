Boy quit
It's gonna be okay, It's gonna be alright

[Jennifer Lewis, Anthony Anderson, Laurence Fishburne, Tracee Ellis Ross]
We raised their children
Then, raised their buildings
And they made billions
I'm catching feelings

[Marsai Martin, Jennifer Lewis, Anthony Anderson, Marcus Scribner]
Really?
What else did we build?
Railroads, Wall Street
The White House and University
UVA?
We built that
Chapel Hill?
We built that
Pyramids?
No, I'm sorry. Our Hebrew brothers get credit for that
Massa, let's turn up and get it poppin'
Settle down we still ain't got nuthin'

[Hook]
We built this
We built this


[Anthony Anderson, Jennifer Lewis, Yara Shahidi,]
I'm done ya'll
I'ma keep it one hunnid'
Tomorrow, when I hit the field, I'ma keep runnin'
We did everything that the overseer wanted
If we got paid, then we'd be stunting
Sugarcane, cotton hands
My blood and sweat came from this land!
My life would've been different if I didn't have cinnamon pigment
We built this!
