Farm Boys YAYUH!

Act Like You Know
I was roundin around snow through the summa' and the winta'
Hittin that ass like a slug pop Glock breakin the inna
Eatin niggas fa dinna take suckas food
Right now I'm on the urge but really I ain't cool
Its that What you know about how do you surrenda
Inhalin niggas M-brake like Rarararararomm
Fifteen on a theft scene
Tell her shit man boom me on them jeans
Gettin things like yamean
Fifty the yacky dyke
Fore I even had starve
Best Believe I'll be stabbin ya
Crackin ya grabbin ya
But I think I went off
Get off my calls cause ain't no room
For Your M.I. Draws
I rip wind pause then fast forward
Stop Eject Gone Before You Knew It
But

[Chorus]
