[Verse 3: Bobby V]
Louie V, fuck with me
Every day's a shopping spree
Got ice that be clear like glass
I be freakin' blindin' me
My level's hard to see
Best to just admire me
Everywhere I go, she go
I go to the sto' just to blow big dough

She got a Louie problem
Louie this and Louie that
Louie hanging from her arm
In her purse a Louie strap
Big cash is everywhere
Haters love to stop and stare
Fly from the shooter here
So fucking hate, I don't care

She all about the money
She all about the cash
She all about me, Bobby
Cause I be serving that ass
I be serving the hard
She be serving me back
I just give her the card
Ain't no limit on that

[Hook: x2]

[Verse 4: Young Joey Da Prince]
Silly me
Buyin all this Louie V
True Religions, rocking Republic, 7's and Frankie B
Gucci, Louie, Fendi, Prada
Dolce and Gabbana
Long as I'mma keep buying designer ?
Threw her in a Hummer truck
Four wheel drive
When you ride, you ain't never stuck
Who is he? Could it be?
Young Joey, he gotta be
Honestly the hottest
Cuz when you shop there ain't no stoppin' me

I ain't seen no black cars
All I know is push 'em in
Prada gotta block 100ft cops
Try'na stuff my Timbalands
Goddamn, I love them haters
Steppin on my ?
