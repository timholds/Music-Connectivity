[Verse 1]
I just put my all in
You take everything from me
I seen that you moved on
Told you girl just wait on me
Maybe you just had to play me
Maybe I just had to grow
Maybe maybe I don't know
Easier to call you a hoe
So I'm gone
Nowadays I'm Sly Cooper on night shift
Stealing girls from old friends
I can't help what I like shit
I'm not the one nobody makes it
Playing hooky, bake a cookie
Buy your coats, bring your hoodies
I'm feeling like it's Tone Season, ooh
I run past the end zone like Forest did
I just don't know when to quit
Maybe I can't take a hint
Let's be clear since we're being honest
Your body count kinda turns me on and
Rumours hurt but they're really harmless
So back that ass like you trying to park it
Ooh girl lay with me I can wipe away your tears
Ooh girl smoke with me I can help you face your fears
Smoke too much how the fuck I'm gon' lie to mom with these purple lips?
Weed so loud plug gave me a hearing aid just to smoke the shit like damn
I can't feel no pain with you
We both so scared that's the truth
I know it's not official
But we're young so what you won't do

[Hook]
Fuck with me
You should come fuck with me
I just want put it down
Want put it down, want put it down on you
Fuck with me
You should come fuck with me
I heard you put it down
But bae can you pick me up too?
(Repeat 2x)

[Verse 2]
I spent 2 bills on my shoes
I know that don't impress you
I don't got hoes like you do
I seen you laying with dude
I know I still watch your story
You just so scared to be boring
I snapped you so please don't ignore me
Checkmate girl what's your move

[Hook]

What's the move?
