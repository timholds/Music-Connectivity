Mama don't cry for me
Papa don't feel bad
Cold on the street better gotta keep my bang to the bang back

But I got my hood, my city, my brothers, (my) family

That's all I have yeah, oh

Father if you still listen
We hope our friends make it up to heaven
And if we fall, then we forgotten
Don't let our little brothers grow up like we did

Let them grow up and get a job
Don't let them grow up behind bars
Tryna' be hard, oh father can you

(Rest will come)
