[Intro: Charlie Scene]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come
It's the Day of the Dead

[Verse 1: Johnny 3 Tears]
We come from a world of oblivion, bad dreams
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstring
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things
I'm really not a madman the voices keep asking
Born with this soul that don't wanna be saved
Every time I look around I see what a fiend made
Every time I die I hope they're digging up my grave
An Undead one like the flag that I wave
I'm not afraid to cry from this cocaine sickness
I'm not afraid to die let the good book witness
I ask and give none, nope, no forgiveness
This is Day of the Dead and you're on our hit list
So come, all you misfits
Bitch, you're on our hit list

[Chorus: Danny]
Hold on, Holy Ghost!
Go on, hold me close!
Better run, here we come!
It's the Day of the Dead!
Hold on, holy ghost!
So long to the ones you know!
Better run, here we come!
It's the Day of the Dead!

[Verse 2: Charlie Scene]
This is exactly what has to be done, it happened so gradually
It's like I magically happened to be this phantom that candidly...
Lets this dagger cut jaggedly while you're gasping so rapidly
While you gag on this rag, I feed you while laughing so happily
It's okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark
I'll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart
And I've already started, there ain't no saving your heart
This is the Day of the Dead, this ain't no day in the park
Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones
The fun has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow
And when I'm done, I ain't done 'cause it's hell that follows
Now get ready for sorrow
'Cause it's hell that follows

[Chorus: Danny]
Hold on, Holy Ghost!
Go on, hold me close!
Better run, here we come!
It's the Day of the Dead!
Hold on, holy ghost!
So long to the ones you know!
Better run, here we come!
It's the Day of the Dead!

[Bridge: Danny]
When the ashes start to rise and the moon falls from the sky
And a thousand candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry on the flames below the sky
Would a thousand souls still pray for you and I?

[Chorus: Danny]
Hold on, Holy Ghost!
Go on hold me close!
Better run, here we come!
It's the Day of the Dead!
Hold on, Holy Ghost!
Go on, hold me close!
Better run, here we come!
It's the Day of the Dead!
Hold on, Holy Ghost!
So long to the ones you know!
Better run, here we come!
It's the Day of the Dead!

[Outro: Charlie Scene & Danny & J-Dog]
Hold on, Holy Ghost
It's the Day of the Dead!
Hold on, Holy Ghost
It's the Day of the Dead!
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Here's to the damned!
It's the Day of the Dead!
Hold on, Holy Ghost
Here's to the damned!
It's the Day of the Dead!
