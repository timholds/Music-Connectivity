(Gd) Yea, Baby Boo
I'm always thinking about you
Whatever you do, I'll always trust you
You know... We belong together uh

Chorus â€“ Park Bom
Boy I'm ready for your love (yea yea)
You got me going steady for your love (oh oh)
Nobody but you I'm thinking of (don't cry)
So heavenly so obvious (thanks a lot, yea)
Ooh baby I'm so ready for your love (love me)
You got me going steady for your love (we belong together uh)
Ain't nobody but you I'm thinking of (yess)
That's only because we belong together (let's go)

Gd:
(Oh) Uhh hey baby girl, what's up
Give me just a little time
You be always on the go, it's like, oh, you can barely say 'Hi'
My sweet lover, there can never be another
Wanna rub ya, baby all the above
No one can deny you're so fly, so fly
Gotta say 'my, my'
And it's killing me everyday of the week
Oh, but I guess I get by
Want you on this side of me
Just ride with me to our destination
Kick back, unwind and relax you know

(Pb: Ooh, baby baby)

Never mind your probs and woes
We can sail away and free those
Everyday type city life
Now it's our time, enjoy this view
The sun is out and it's all about you and me
Let's get this groove on
Get a move on
Hey, let's cruise on
Until the morning yo

Repeat Chorus

Top:
(Hey hey, hey hey)
Girly got that good stuff!
Please, give me room, I'ma do when I do these, in full swing
When I cleared the room, there she was, so beauty
Never ever did I lay my two eyes on so much juicy (so juicy)
Gotta say she's so incredible; classy, not a hoochie
So truly, wanna show her I'm that kinda guy, fosho
That gives her more than your average, I'm goin' all for broke
Just like these deep flows, I got what it takes to beat yours
So they may call me 'hero'
But enough of that you're all crying out 'Drama'

Girl you got my head on spin, ain't nothing I would do
What's going on, we going out
Cuz it's about me and you
I'm talking every second of every minute, I'm thinking about you
We gonna breeze right through, forever from my heart, I promise you

Repeat Chorus

(Gd: yea, listen)

Pb:
The way you treatin' me
So heavenly and wonderful (Trust me)
Oh we have so much so fun, can't get enough, I need some more (Na, na)
That's for sure, gotta let you know
I'm ready to just give you my all (Gotta be, gotta be my love)
And I can't wait for you to hold me gently in your arms (I'm so happy)
Caress my body baby, as we both become one (I love you)
Feel it all deeply in my heart (I will)
That we belong together my love, oh

Gd:
(Oh) Baby, your love is so mind-blowing (Pb: Oh yea)
I need you, gotta please you my girl
And that's for life-long (Oh baby, baby)
Baby, you know we're so right flowin'
Indeed we got a thing, can't no one ever deny

Baby, your love is so mind-blowing (Pb: oh baby baby...)
I need you, gotta please you my girl
And that's for life-long (You know that I love you, yea)
Baby, you know we're so right flowin' (belong together)
Indeed we got a thing, can't no one ever deny (ooh baby...)
