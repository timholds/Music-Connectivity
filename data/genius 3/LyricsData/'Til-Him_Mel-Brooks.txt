[LEO, spoken]
Your honor...when I was in Rio, and had everything I'd ever dreamed of, I suddenly realized that this man... this man...

(sung)
No one every made me feel like someone
'Til him
Life was really nothing but a glum one
'Til him
My existence bordered on the tragic
Always timid, never took a chance
Then I felt his magic
And my heart began to dance

I was always frightened, fraught with worry
'Til him
I was going nowhere in a hurry
'Til him
He filled up my empty life
Filled it to the brim
There could never ever be
Another one like him

[MAX, spoken]
Leo, I ... I never realized ... you're a good singer

[LEO, spoken]
Thank you, Max. I sang it for you. I sang it because I'm your friend

[MAX]
You are? Gee, I've had a lot of relationships, but you couldn't call any of them "friend". But come to think of it...

(sung)
No one ever ever really knew me
'Til him
Everyone was always out to screw me
'Til him
Never met I man I ever trusted
Always dealt with shysters in the past
Now I'm well adjusted
'Cause I've got a friend at last

[LITTLE OLD LADIES]
Aaaaaaaahh!

[MAX, spoken]
Don't help me

(sung)
Always playing singles, never doubles
'Til him
Never had a pal to share my troubles
'Til him

[LEO]
He filled up my empty life

[BOTH]
Filled it to the brim

[LEO]
There could never ever be
Another one... like him

[JUDGE, spoken]
Gentleman, it breaks my heart to break up such a beautiful friendship, so I won't. Five years at the State Penitentiary at Sing-Sing!
