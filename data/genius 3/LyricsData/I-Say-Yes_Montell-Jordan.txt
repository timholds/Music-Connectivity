Hallelujah
God is speaking to someone
Right now
I don't know where you are, who you are
God has a message for you
You see, oh, thank you Lord

See, whatever it is
That you've been searching for
Searching and looking
Looking all over
You're searching and you're trying to find it
You don't know what it is, God is gonna show you
He's gonna show you right there
What you're looking for
And all you have to do is say yes
Help me

I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes

I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes
I'm gonna say yes, I'm gonna say yes

All of my life, I'll say
(Shhhh!)
Make sure you get this now

My friend said he needed someone
Not searching for just anyone
I recommend the name of Christ
He said he didn't need Him in his life
But mother's sickness, daddy's lung disease
Financial burden found him on his knees
He searched his heart and realized
Although I'm down, my soul can rise

Am I lost in sin? (I'll say yes)
Is there anyway that I can be saved? (I'll say yes)
If I run to You, will You, will You hear my cry? (I'll say yes)
Will You dry all these tears from my eyes? (I'll say yes)
So many questions, Lord

All of my life, I say yes

But I'm ready
And I'm willing
To go all the way
Yeah, say yes

You're spinning around on a ferris wheel
Trying to find what's really real
Now old Confucius is wise, I'm told
But him and Buddha can't save your soul
Ol' Elijah didn't die for you
It's time for someone to tell the truth
When critics say, it don't make sense
I'm the living evidence

When it feels like I can't go on
I'll just say (I'll say yes)
When the world say no
You'll still hear Montell, when he says (I'll say yes)
When I'm talked about, and lied on, and criticized
(I'll say yes)
Even then, He'll make everything alright (I'll say yes)
I wanna testify

All of my life, I'll say
Through the storming rain
You know I'll say yes
Heartache and pain
You know I'll say yes
Everyday
You know I'll say yes
All over the building
Everybody, stand up on your feet
And say

All of my life, I'm gonna say yes

Ad lib until fade
