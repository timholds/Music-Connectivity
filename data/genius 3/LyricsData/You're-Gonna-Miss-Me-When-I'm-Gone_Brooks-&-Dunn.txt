[Verse 1]
I'm still hurtin' from the last time
You walked on this heart of mine
I can't find much to believe in
You let me down so many times

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Heaven knows how much I love you
But I'm tired of holdin' on

[Chorus]
You better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Not much chance we're gonna make it
If I'm the only one who's tryin'
You know I'm runnin' out of reasons
We're runnin' out of time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Someday, girl, you're gonna wake up
And wonder what went wrong

[Chorus]
You better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

[Verse 3]
You're good at goin' through the motions
And all I hear are alibis
Now I get this empty feelin'
When I look into your eyes

[Pre-Chorus 3]
An' I don't see a love light shinin'
An' I don't know what's goin' on

[Chorus]
You better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

You better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

You better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

You better kiss me
'Cause you're gonna miss me when I'm gone
Oh, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone

You better kiss me
