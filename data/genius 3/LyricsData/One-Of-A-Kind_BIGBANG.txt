What they say
Doesn't matter to us anyway
You know we're going to find a better way
I said a better way

By your side
Lead the way if i get lost
And i'll help you at any cost
We'll find a better way

You're one of a kind
One of a kind
You're making me shine
Making me shine
You're one of a kind
And i think you know

For my friend Jo
Can i ever thank you enough
For Just being who you are
In my world you're the brightest star
You build me up
Help me grow and get on
Lift me up where i belong
And we'll find a better way

You're one of a kind
One of a kind
You're making me shine
Making me shine
You're one of a kind
You're making me shine
And don't you know
I love you

You're one of a kind
One of a kind
You're making me shine
Making me shine
You're one of a kind
You're making me shine
You make me shine
You're one of a kind one of a kind
