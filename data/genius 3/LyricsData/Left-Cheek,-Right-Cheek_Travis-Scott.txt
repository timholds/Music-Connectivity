[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top, my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as, you know
Who the one
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top, my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as, you know
Who the one

[Verse 1: Travis Scott]
Alright, alright
We 'bout to take off, sit tight
Link up, get right
Have my Velveeta, we'll have a good night
Tip her, tip her
It make her cum quicker, quicker
Having you for dinner, dinner
Make me wanna put it in ya, in ya

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top, my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as you know
Who the one
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top, my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as you know
Who the one

[Interlude: Bernie Mac & Monica Calhoun]
What did she say?
Baby, those white bitches looked at that white man dead in the eyes and told him
"Fuck that, pay me!" haha!
And that's why I get 30 percent
When can I start?
Immediately

[Chorus: Travis Scott]
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top, my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as you know
Who the one
Left cheek, right cheek
Up top, my suite
Don't stop, go girl
Long as you know
Who the one

[Verse 2: Jeremih]
No love for 'em
Drugs, money
She wants to fuck
She need it
No love, no fucks
