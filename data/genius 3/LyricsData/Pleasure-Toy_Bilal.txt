[Intro: Bilal]
Vibrate her, let the music vibrate her
I just let the music vibrate her
Don’t let go of what you’re feeling
Vibrate her
Let the rhythm move your body
Vibrate her, vibrate her
Vibrate her, vibrate her

[Pre-Chorus: Bilal]
Come on, come on, come on and let the music touch your soul
I’m just the tool to make your body lose control
Just like a DJ I can make your body move
Just like a rocket, rocket

[Chorus: Bilal]
I be your pleasure toy
Every time you’re feeling lonely, pleasure toy
Girl use me I wanna be your pleasure toy
Come and find me, come and turn me, turn me, on

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
Shawty, it’s hard to be subtle when you want what you want
Don’t need to whisper to me all the do’s and the dont’s
I know which buttons to push to start up your motor
Igniting your flame, then blow you out when it’s over
This that old school stroke you wish you had
I’m staying by, you clutch your Birkin bag
But those days that you wanna get through
Let me build a cabin for that ass with this wood
Percolate, percolate
What good is a figure 8 if it doesn’t circulate
Polish off your crystal ball
So I can see the future still we’re broken [?] like waterfalls
Shit, I light that up
Your pleasure was the song, let me write that up
I’m good with the great beats and deep grooves
Baby turn me on and let em do what I do

[Pre-Chorus: Bilal]
Come on, come on, come on and let the music touch your soul
I’m just the tool to make your body lose control
Just like a DJ I can make your body move
Just like a rocket, rocket

[Chorus: Bilal]
I be your pleasure toy
Every time you’re feeling lonely, pleasure toy
Girl use me I wanna be your pleasure toy
Come and find me, come and turn me, turn me, on

[Verse 2: Bilal]
Pull me on, I wanna start your erotic flow
Can’t get too loud, cause your baby’s in the next room
Your body has so much too explore
Look what you found, can't turn me down, acting like you want more

[Pre-Chorus 2: Bilal]
When you lay me down, I'm always here
I know a spot to get your out of here
I get the feeling I'm about to explode
Just like a rocket, rocket

[Chorus: Bilal]
I be your pleasure toy
Every time you’re feeling lonely, pleasure toy
Girl use me I wanna be your pleasure toy
Come and find me, come and turn me, turn me, on

[Outro: Bilal]
Yeah just call me baby
I be right here for you
I be your pleasure toy
Play this record
Just rock it
Rock it in for me
You know how many
