I wish I could feel anything at all
But I’m just a pile of want and doubt

We’re having people over later on
Bring Caroline and the effigies

There are days when I imagine myself
Falling through space for the rest of time

Come right in and sit beside the fire
We’ll have someone bring you a tray of pigs in blankets
You look

[Voice A]
Really uncomfortable if I'm being honest
[Voice B]
Pale. Did you hit something on your way over?

[Voice A]
Is there something we should know about?
[Voice B]
Can’t say you look quite like yourself, friend

We just want to help

Oh look it’s Pendergast and his associates
They’ll know just what to do
In fact I think they’ve seen this kind of thing before
Don’t worry, relax, you’ll be fine
Just lie back and stop squirming

Please listen to us
We have your best interests in mind
We’ve had our eyes on you for a long, long time

[Voice A]
We want to explore infinite possibilities of knowing you
[Voice B]
This gives you some time to find a way to relate to us, and us to you

You’ll see for yourself

We’ll be welcoming you to the inner lair
Won’t be long
Babe, hush now this won’t hurt at all
