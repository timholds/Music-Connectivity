[Verse 1]
Remember the first day when I saw your face
Remember the first day when you smiled at me
You stepped to me and then you said to me
I was the woman you dreamed about
Remember the first day when you called my house
Remember the first day when you took me out
We had butterflies although we tried to hide it
And we both had a beautiful night

[Pre-Hook]
The way we held each others hand
The way we talked the way we laughed
It felt so good to find true love
I knew right then and there you were the one

[Hook]
I know that he loves me cause he told me so
I know that he loves me cause his feelings show
When he stares at me you see he cares for me
You see how he is so deep in love
I know that he loves me cause its obvious
I know that he loves me cause it's me he trusts
And he's missing me if he's not kissing me
And when he looks at me his brown eyes tell his soul

[Verse 2]
Remember the first day, the first day we kissed
Remember the first day we had an argument
We apologized and then we compromised
And we haven't argued since
Remember the first day we stopped playing games
Remember the first day you fell in love with me
It felt so good for you to say those words
Cause I felt the same way too

[Pre-Hook & Hook]

[Bridge]
I'm so happy so happy that you're in my life
And baby now that you're a part of me
You showed me
Showed me the true meaning of love
And i know he loves me

[Hook]
