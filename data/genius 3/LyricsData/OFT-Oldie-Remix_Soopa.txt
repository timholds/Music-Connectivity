[First Verse]

I'm only 18, skinny dude
Soopacrzy, one of the greatest, now who is you?
Got a clue and its blue, no help from Steve yo
She was riding passenger, drunk off that cliquot
Fasten ya seatbelts, take you on a ride
To the OFT pharcyde, niggas here with no lives
Living like my last, procrastination is not a option
Cause waiting for my future's too much, id rather stop it
I'm rapping cause I love hip hop, now really that's the option
But if it lands me deals, then I'll gladly take the profit
Listening to rashad and confidence helps my lyricism
They wanna battle but the competition ain't up in em
Don't waste ya breath, unless you really tryna take this test
It's like you matching up with Jordan, tell me who's the best?
Best, murder anonymously, obviously
I'm the best, no wonder why they copy me
