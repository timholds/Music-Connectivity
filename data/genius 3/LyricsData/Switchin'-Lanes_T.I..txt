[Intro: T.I.]
Make sure what you ride for
Is somethin' you would die for
Make sure what you ride for
Is somethin' you would die for

[Verse 1: T.I.]
All my nigga wanna do is hit a lick and flip some raw
Boy you better prepare yourself, them people finna set it off
What you oughta wanna do is get this money too with me
Even if you Bobby Seal, you gon' need a Huey P
I'm doin' me, international fluently
Speak the lingo my people talk
Don't disrespect my people, dog
Or turn the other cheek, that ain't the shit that we were taught
Arm yourself, defend yourself, they try you get to squeezin' off
We've been out crazy
Do you like it in them jeans dawg?
Season dog, leave me out know they don't want me involved
I'm dodgin' 12, they be on watch
But I'm just ridin' with my home boys

[Hook: Trev Case]
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec

[Verse 2: Big KRIT]
We talkin' high life, listenin' to UGK
Ridin' dirty mean you clean on swangers
If them law pull up then that means thanks
Turn up the changer, bangin' out the whip
They muffle the signs, all the hoe shit that we were dealin' with
Cause we be young and in the hustle
Partna sellinâ€˜ whole, but no food in the cupboard like damn
I really wanna be a millionaire one day, one day
My nigga say yeah
We dyin' out here for a little bit of neck but the government just don't care
So I'm talkin' Multi to the fullest
As long as I'm livin', fuck the ones
When I was young, they let me ride shot gun
And show me how to get it
And you can ball all you want in the paint for the digits
But you gotta learn how to pivot
For the score, never speak, bet the goal that you want
Gotta keep it slow mo when you outchea creepin'
Watch for the lows when your head up high
Head in the sky and you're outchea tippin'
All you've got is your word and your bond
Prepare for the hate when you're switchin' suites

[Hook: Trev Case]
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec

[Verse 3: T.I.]
I'm either out or I'm all in it
This shit creek and we all in it
One false move and we all finish
We come together, we all winnin'
But you'd rather go and get your dogs in it
Either rob for the money, hit the mall with it
Then to the club, pull the broad with it
Then wylin' chopper in it, I'm goin' down with it, no lie
You get a chance, go to Dubai
You see your money ain't as much as you thought
Matter of fact motherfuckers so rich
Make nigga feel petty and ashamed just for showin' it off
100 thou for the outfit
A billion dollars worth of sun plugged in the outlet
You put your money where your mouth at
You won't be talkin' much would ya
If you was weren't about shit
Revolutionary do it for the niggas that wish they were there to do it
Gotta chance to do me boy you better do it
Nigga comin' back and shootin' very good
Speakin' better than a felon would
Got me property up in Ellenwood
And my position, I just fell into it
Devil want my soul and I ain't sell it to him

[Hook: Trev Case]
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Switchin' through lanes like hey-ey-ey
Paint drippin', swing with this .30 on me
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec
Drivin' real slow, ridin' with my Tec

[Outro: T.I.]
Make sure what you ride for
Is somethin' you would die for
Make sure what you ride for
Is somethin' you would die for
