[Verse]
Time keeps slipping, slipping
And I'm next to you
Next to you
I'll keep running, running
Right back to the truth
And it's you

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The road only makes us stronger
But you can't count every mile
This flame is getting hotter
Got to break the ice

[Chorus]
So come on over, lean on my shoulder
I'm not afraid, we're only getting older
So glad I found you, knew I was bound to
When I was breaking down, you taught me how to
Carry on, carry on, it's a long marathon
Carry on, carry on, it's a long marathon
It's a long marathon home
It's a long marathon home

[Verse]
Time keeps slipping, slipping
And I'm next to you
Next to you
I'll keep running, running
Right back to the truth
And it's you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
You know I wanna get it started
Some things you gotta leave behind
Like punching under water
Life hits slow sometimes

[Chorus]
So come on over, lean on my shoulder
I'm not afraid, we're only getting older
So glad I found you, knew I was bound to
When I was breaking down, you taught me how to
Carry on, carry on, it's a long marathon
Carry on, carry on, it's a long marathon
It's a long marathon home
It's a long marathon home
It's a long marathon home
It's a long marathon home

[Outro]
Carry on, carry on, it's a long marathon
Carry on, carry on, it's a long marathon
