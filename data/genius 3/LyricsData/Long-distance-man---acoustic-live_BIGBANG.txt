When you get up in the morning
While you work till late at night
As you sit along and watch some movie
About guys who loves to fight
She will take off all her make-up
Brush her teeth and go to bed
Fall asleep and dream you laid your hand
Upon her head
Do you hear the calling
From a sidetrack of your mind
Singing backing vocals
To the sound of your busy mind
You will sit in front of a paper
Sort your feelings if you can
But no matter what you think you are
You are no long distance man
You will go out and stand there laughing
Pretend you're having fun
Getting used to people saying
Look what you've done
Do you hear the calling
From a sidetrack of your mind
Singing backing vocals
To the sound of your busy line
Twice as alone when you're together
Faking smiles and holding hands
Each one guided only by their own
Fears and demands
And together you'll walk in silence
Not knowing what to say
What was I thinking about the other day
When you get up in the morning
While you work till late at night
As you sit alone and watch.....
You fall asleep in your Hollywood light
