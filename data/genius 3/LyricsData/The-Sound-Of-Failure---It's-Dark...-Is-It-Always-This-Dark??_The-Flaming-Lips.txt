[Verse 1]
She's starting to live her life
From the inside out
The sound of failure calls her name
She's decided to hear it out

[Chorus]
So go tell Britney and go tell Gwen
She's not trying to go against all them
Because she's too scared and she can't pretend
To understand where it begins or ends
Or what it means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let them go on

[Verse 2]
Standing there in the graveyard
While the moon sprays its fireworks in your hair
The sound of failure calls her name
She's decided to hear it out

[Chorus]
So go tell Britney and go tell Gwen
She's not trying to go against all them
Because she's too scared and she can't pretend
To understand where it begins or ends
Or what it means to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let them go on
Where it begins or ends
Or what it's like to be dead
It's just a sound going through your head
Let it go on
