[Verse 1]
You put your heart up on a shelf
I know it's hard to be by yourself
You need someone, that's true and strong
Well baby someone, just came along

[Chorus]
I am that man, you're trying to find
I am that man, you had in mind
And I'll give you all my love, 'til you understand
I won't give up, 'cause I know, I am

[Verse 2]
Talk is cheap, it ain't worth a dime
So don't talk to me, just give me some time
I'm gonna show you, what love can be
My job won't be done, until you believe

[Chorus]
I am that man, you're trying to find
I am that man, you had in mind
And I'll give you all my love, 'til you understand
I won't give up, 'cause I know...

I am that man, you're trying to find
I am that man, you had in mind
And I'll give you all my love, 'til you understand
I won't give up, 'cause I know, I am

[Outro]
No I won't give up, 'cause I am, that man
