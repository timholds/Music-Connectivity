(Hook)
L-Theanine . . . L-Theanine . . . Tetrahydrocannibinol

[Verse I: Killah Priest]
Street, devotion, love
An open slug makes ‘em soak in blood
Emotion’s touched
Families clutch
Mothers cry a flood
Wishful thinking , then it’s drinking
Or get high off drugs
What’s in the sky above?
A zillion devil masks
Worn by the ugly face that makes mirrors crack
From a Christmas past
Crystals in the glass
Then the lighter
Then it’s star trek
Then where mars at
They lose weight
Eyes dilate
And roll far back
Fuck that
It’s the god of rap
Real niggas nod to that
My bars are facts
Not fiction
The social system
The ecosystem
The theory of complexity
The cube, I’m talking neo-vision
Orange, gold, the sun
I’m talking, Leos listen

(Hook)

[Verse 2: Killah Priest]
Yo, seductive poison take out your fam
Yo, you’ve been anointed, gun in your hand
Catch him in front of the unemployment
Through the news stand
Bullets made a clear voyage
He grabbed a child for a shield
Screams! He ran toward his car
But bullets beat him to the dashboard and his wheel
Holes through his neck and his shoulder
His last cries and alibi connect is over
True stories from a killer’s perspective
A nigga’s collectives
DA put him away
Should have seen the smile as he exits
Project novels, Street gospels
Touched the soul, like a little girl is fondled
By hands that cold
The Tao and physics of Priest
Make lyrics that’s street
Vivid on beats
Mystic and deep
The eloquent, intelligent
From worlds above and beneath
(Hook)
Verse III
It goes off like a silent bomb and quiet screams
Invasion of a killer army from violent scenes
From a snow castle wearing frozen crowns
Gold tassels, fringes hanging form his royal gown
Mountains, ivory fountains, walls of mac 10s and SKs
Esés, gold-headed falcon
Colored glass windows on his limo
Gladys Knight can’t it be all so simple
Peep the raw dosage
Quiet explosive of the writers focus
So esoteric in high voltage
Like 200 milligrams of dilaudid
I’ll have ‘em nodding
Priest the comet
Leave a comment
I’m all hero like the Hall of Justice
They all tried to uses my style like crutches
Report form the streets
Walter got the coverage
