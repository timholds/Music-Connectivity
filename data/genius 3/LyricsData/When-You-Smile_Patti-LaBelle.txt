In my life I never
Dreamed I'd ever
Feel the way I do
When we're together
Loving you I'm brand new
Nothing could be better
Every moment spent with you
Is so incredible
You're the king of my heart
Your kiss is on my soul

Finally I've found
What I've been looking for
You are everything to me
And even more
I can see the heart of you
I so adore in your eyes
When you smile
All my hopes and dreams are
Really coming true
Only happens anytime
That I'm with you
Being here right now

Is all I want to do
In my life
When you smile

All it took was just a glance
And I was captivated
I'm so glad that we've had
This time beneath the sun

Finally I've found
What I've been looking for
You are everything to me
And even more
I can see the heart of you
I so adore in your eyes
When you smile
All my hopes and dreams are
Really coming true
Only happens anytime
That I'm with you
Being here right now

[Bridge:]
I don't crave gold
To make me whole
I just need you
To soothe my soul
And be for me
My shining star
I love you just
The way you are

Finally I've found
What I've been looking for
You are everything to me
And even more
I can see the heart of you
I so adore in your eyes
When you smile
All my hopes and dreams are
Really coming true
Only happens anytime
That I'm with you
Being here right now
