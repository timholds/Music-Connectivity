[Intro: Sample]
"The world is under attack at this very moment by the most powerful forces man has ever seen! Fate from the depths of the earth, 'Operation: Lifesaver' is in effect, as of right now!"

[Verse: MF DOOM]
Wow, it caught me off guard, went to breathe out and then she made me cough hard
Contact the god and let him know to slip two in, fine. How are you doing?
Can I get you a drink?, This one's a shoo-in
Awkward situation that I'm on a mission to ruin
Her big butt and smile was like camo, hit up the men's room, we need more ammo (reload)
Watch your 3 o'clock, a new recruit, that's her gin and Juicy Juice
Use a stick of Juicy Fruit (fire in the hole), she just knew she was cute
It's in her own best interest, it's less stress
Hit her with the "Do you need a mint?" test
It don't matter if she's slim or dressed to impress, I won't rest
Fellas don't fess, some of 'em just need to eat the whole thing of Crest
"-it's in effect!"
It's been a long day, it's just how the song say:
"'Operation: Lifesaver' is in effect, as of right now!"
I hope she don't take this the wrong way...

[Outro: Sample and MF DOOM]


"Are you ready?
Are you with it?
Okay, let's go, you know what to do
The whole world's watching and counting on you
And all you people listening out there, everybody, everywhere
Hang on! Hang on! Hang on!"
"Yeah!"
"Yeah!"
Â 
You need a mint bitch
"No! The beat stopped!"
