[Hook]
When I get a million, gator-toed reptilian
Lamborghini killin' 'em, money at my ceiling
When I get my bread up, like I got a bread truck
If I get a pot to piss in, when I lift my head up
See me on top! (see me on top)

[Verse 1]
All I want is money, All I see is paper
I don't owe you shit! Motherfuck a favor
Motherfuck a hater, prayin' to my maker
Tomorrow ain't promised, I might just see Him later
I might just get my cake up and never have to rap
I might just sell a million and never hit the trap
House full of plaques, walls full of racks
I might just get a bad bitch, and never come back!
Like, how he done that?! Fly above the struggle
Past in my trunk, future in my duffel
Emerged from the rubble
The cracks in the street
If I had a chance, but 'if' is all I need

[Hook]
When I get a million, gator-toed reptilian
Lamborghini killin' 'em, money at my ceiling
When I get my bread up, like I got a bread truck
If I get a pot to piss in, when I lift my head up
See me on top! (see me on top)

[Verse 2]
All I want is peace! What the fuck is pain?!
You can work for bull shit, I can't do the same
I'm deep in the game
Shit'll drive you crazy, signed once or twice
Now look at how the played me, bet you think they paid me
Bet you think I blew it all
Mad cause I'm from Mississippi, scared cause I do it all
"Whatcha mean you do it all?"
Yeah, I really do it all!
Produce and mix my own shit, outrap all of y'all!
Labels scared to take a fall
They ain't really signin' checks
Check this for the nonbelievers, askin' why I ain't signed yet Askin' why I ain't dying yet
Like what I'm supposed to do?!
I'm Big K.R.I.T., bitch! So who the fuck is you?!

[Hook]
When I get a million, gator-toed reptilian
Lamborghini killin' 'em, money at my ceiling
When I get my bread up, like I got a bread truck
If I get a pot to piss in, when I lift my head up
