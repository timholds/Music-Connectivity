Everything I’d change a whole life to rearrange
Only one dream was good only once I understood

Down the hill from where I live
There’s a road that I never take
Have I gone out or did you come in
I can’t remember now that I’m awake

I never speak about what treasure I have found
I outlived my past and silence will make it last

Down the hill from where I live
There’s a road that I never take
Have I gone out or did you come in
I can’t remember now that I’m awake

You pulled me away and what more can I say
If it was meant to be it’s now that I am free

Down the hill from where I live
There’s a road that I never take
Have I gone out or did you come in
I can’t remember now that I’m awake
