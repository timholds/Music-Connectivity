[Verse 1]
In one more hour
I will be gone
In one more hour
I'll leave this room
The dress you wore
The pretty shoes
Are things I left
Behind for you

[Bridge 1]
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes

[Chorus 1]
I needed it
(I know I know I know)
Oh I needed it
(It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it
(I know I know I know)
Oh I needed it
(You never wanted to let it let it go)

[Verse 2]
If you could talk
What would you say?
For you things were
Just night and day
Take off the dress
Take off the face
I'll hold you close
Before I leave

[Bridge 1]
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes
Oh, you've got the darkest eyes

[Chorus 2]
I needed it
(I know I know I know)
Oh I needed it
(It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it
(I know I know I know)
Oh I needed it
(It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it
(I know I know I know)
I needed it
(It's so hard for you to say goodbye)
I needed it
(I know I know I know)
I needed it
(You need a little bit, just a little more time)

[Bridge 2]
Don't say another word
About the other girl
Don't say another word
About the other girl

[Outro]
I needed it
(I know I know I know)
Oh I needed it
(It's so hard for you to let it go)
I needed it
(I know I know I know)
Oh I needed it
(Never wanted ? to let it go)
