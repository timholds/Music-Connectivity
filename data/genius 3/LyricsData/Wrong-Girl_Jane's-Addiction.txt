You messed with the wrong girl
She but small but she's fierce
She shattered the glass out
With the highs of a heel
You led with the wrong line
When you called her c*** and all
So what make's a guy think
That it hurts a girl?

It don't hurt a girl
She loves her dangerous play
Kicks and screams as she dances
Keeps a pretty face

You messed with the wrong girl
She has her ways and means
Laughs at the traffic
From the easy streets
Enters in cages
With no bites when she leaves
If guys are too rough now
Then that's what you think!

It don't hurt a girl
She loves her dangerous play
Kicks and screams as she dances
Keeps a pretty face

She's like a mother eagle
Come'n down
She's like a mother eagle
Come'n down

Oh now she's cutting every corner
She's tearin' up the grass
'cause cars ain't for parkin' man
A car's what you pass

It don't stop a girl
She loves her dangerous play
Kicks and screams as she dances
Keeps a pretty face
Oh, I love her pretty face!
I love her pretty face!
What a pretty face!
