Did you see him when I was away?
I would have phoned but you'd spoil the trip
Will he be in the pub tonight?
I'll hate marriage and take a sip

Will he be yours as of today?
Will I never see you now if you're taken?
Are you still wearing that ring?
When she told me I was a little shaken

Like a bird without the bed
Her sister says that we'll get wed
And I should tell you I adore you
But I'm sure it would just bore you
