Mummy always wants you to come for tea (ah oh)
Don't be shy, straighten up your tie
Get down from your tree house sitting in the sky (ah oh)
I want to know just what to do
Is it very big, is there room for two

I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Gotta let me in, hey hey hey
Let the fun begin, hey
I'm the wolf today, hey hey hey
I'll huff, I'll puff
I'll huff, I'll puff, I'll blow you away
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't (say you will)
Say you're true, say to me
C'est la vie
Say you will, say you won't
Say you'll do what I don't (say you will, hey)
Say you're true, say to me (get a life)

Do you play with the girls, play with the boys?
Do you ever get lonely playing with your toys? (ah oh)
We can talk, we can sing
I'll be the queen and you'll be the king (ah oh)
Hey boy, in your tree
Throw down a ladder, make room for me (ah oh)
I got a house with windows and doors
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
Gotta let me in, hey hey hey
