[Verse 1]
14 Rue de Savoy
That's where the flat was let
We shacked up in Paris two days after we had met
Eighteen bars of the sonata and you were mine
This music gig doesn't pay that well
But the fans are alright

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, come home
I can't take the apartment alone
You left your beret behind
And your croissant is getting cold

[Verse 2]
Visa, MasterCard
Discovered that I was spent
Took my heart, my best jeans
And left me with paying the rent
A user, abuser, a loser
But I didn't care
I've always been a guy with a sweet tooth
And that girl was just like a king-sized candy bar

[Pre-Chorus]
Pick up the phone
Meet me at the Sorbonne
You keep turning me on
With those French words I can't pronounce

[Chorus]
Milkshake n' honey, yeah
Milkshake n' honey, yeah
Milkshake n' honey, yeah
(Ma petite, comment ca va?)
Milkshake n' honey, yeah
(Ma petite, comment ca va?)
Milkshake n' honey, yeah
Milkshake n' honey, yeah
Milkshake n' honey, yeah
Milkshake n' honey, yeah
