[Verse 1]
I keep thinkin' any minute you'll be comin' home honey
I ain't seen nothin' of you in a month of Sundays
Tell me how long gone are you gonna be

[Verse 2]
All you said was you had to get goin'
Oh but baby I wouldn't mind knowin' just
How long gone are you gonna be

[Chorus]
How'm I s'posed to make any plans
When I still don't even understand
If you're ever gonna come back home to me
Tell me please, how long gone are you gonna be

[Verse 3]
Maybe I didn't pay enough attention
But I do believe you forgot to mention
Just how long gone are you gonna be

[Verse 4]
The phone ain't ringin', 'cause you ain't callin'
I ain't been hearin' your footsteps fallin'
Tell me, how long gone are you gonna be

[Chorus]
How'm I s'posed to make any plans
When I still don't even understand
If you're ever gonna come back home to me
Tell me please, how long gone are you gonna be

[Interlude]

Yeah, how'm I s'posed to make any plans
When I still don't even understand
If you're ever gonna come back home to me
Tell me please, how long gone are you gonna be

[Outro]
Tell me, how long gone are you gonna be
