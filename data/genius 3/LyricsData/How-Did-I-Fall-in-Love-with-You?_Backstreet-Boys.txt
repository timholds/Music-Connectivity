[Verse 1]
Remember when, we never needed each other
The best of friends like
Sister and Brother
We understood, we'd never be
Alone
Those days are gone, and I want you so much
The night is long and I need your touch
Don't know what to say
I never meant to feel this way
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

[Chorus]
What can I do, to make you mine
Falling so hard so fast this time
What did I say, what did you do?
How did I fall in love with you?

[Verse 2]
I hear your voice
And I start to tremble
Brings back the child that, I resemble
I cannot pretend, that we can still be friends
Don't want to be
Alone tonight

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Oh I want to say this right
And it has to be tonight
Just need you to know, oh yeah
I don't want to live this life
I don't want to say goodbye
With you I want to spend
The rest of my life

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
What can I do, to make you mine
Falling so hard so fast this time
Everything's changed, we never knew

[Outro]
How did I fall
In love
With you?
