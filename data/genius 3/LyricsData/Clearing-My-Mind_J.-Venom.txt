[Intro]

[Verse 1: J. Venom]
Kickin' it 53 stations of Tokaido
And that's why I'm still kickin' back in Ohio
Oh wait I'm not, I'm on the other side of the river
My words are small and sharp just like a sliver
Oh wait, I'm back now, but that's what you figured
I do what I say, and so, yeah I delivered
This hot wordplay over tripped out beats
And my words and instrumentals are always bringin' heat
These words are exactly how I clear my mind
When I start spittin' shit slows like frozen time
Sight slowly returns to men who were clearly blind
And then the deaf start bumping out to this chill grind
When I start rappin' motherfuckers notice
And so I clear my mind and just try to focus
It ain't witchcraft, no 'hocus-pocus'
Fuck ya'll haters who say that I be bogus

[Verse 2: Sumi]
Solidarity sold up on this solid market
Sumi and J. Venom wreckin', fetchin' for to start shit
Get up on this like a twenty dollar ho this situation savin'
Mental fortification foundate a broken nation and save it with a Playstation
Sony has a boner and fundies stroke the owners
Money for the savior and none for the players
I'm just here to be a sayer, clearin' mind with the papers
So I guess I'll catch you later
Another rhyme, another time, another layer
Peel it back again, the onion is the flavor
I'm guessing again, this mind needs a new mayor
I'm just sayin', I'm debatin' in my head
It's like a patient with a mealy sort of patience
Like an undercooked potato dish
I'm going fishing, line always caught in the trees
So now I'm wishing, can someone cut my line free, please?
