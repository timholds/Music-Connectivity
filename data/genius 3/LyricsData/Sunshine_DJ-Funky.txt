[Hook: Big KRIT]
Put up all my troubles today
Won't you let 'em playa ride
Without a cloud in the sky
These angel's wings keep me high
Who said a Chevy can't fly?
Rain clouds let me by
(Sunshine in my life, sunshine in my life)
Rain clouds let me by
(Sunshine in my life, sunshine in my life)

[Verse 1: Big KRIT]
This feel like 1-9-9-5, sitting on the curb
Cousin Reggie was a playa, used to give us word
Of ridin' in his whip, had to ride in the front
Never rode in the back, too much sub in the trunk
Too much tint on the car, laws trip with his dog brawls
Broads can't see out face, but they know who we are
Back in the day it didn't rain much
A sunny day in the hood all you wanted when you came up
Now it's drive-by's and we really ride by
When we used to roll up, cut the glass, cut ties
And the grass too high, and the [?] lady gone
And all the [?] schools, dope boys used to own
Rain clouds, watch the shine off the chrome in the [?]
Pull it back and let me bone, damn shame
How we change when when it storm
[?] won't
Tell 'em bring my nigga home
And let' em ride

[Hook]
