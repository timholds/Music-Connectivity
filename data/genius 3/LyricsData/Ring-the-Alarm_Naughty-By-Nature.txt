[Hook: Vinny x2]
Ring the alarm
Jersey bring the bitch out the bastards
Whoa, yeah
We get cash in wit bass D.O.A
You'll find that higher Brick City D.O.A

[Verse 1: Vinny]
It just ain't your time yet, and you still claiming rhyme vet
Criticize us when your bitch ass ain't even signed yet
Instincts is mental, some bitch stinking gentle
Go re-shine your cymbal and rethink your demo
If fifth was a fifth we'd both be drunk
And if it hurt my shit, he'd be dead in the trunk
Fuck the funk, pass the punk
And parade on Upper Lassgate
The charge in the city and still perform for Pataki
In that case it must be Naughty for life
Shout out to all my niggas doing 20 to life
I trust fools about as far as I see you tricks
So fuck you [?] I don't need you jinx (Ha!)

[Hook x2 (Replace Jersey with Westside on repeat)]

[Verse 2: Vinny]
Spark the mic, electric kiss of death
Smoking MCs before they have a chance to take one breath
I got the shit to blow right through your vest
Any nigga thinking they wanna step to this, jump and test
Naughty's been known for bringing major niggas max of stress
Never want us in your party cause we crack your set
Little juvenile delinquent gets a classic vet
Somebody come and grab your child before I snap his neck
Uuh! Yeah! You motherfuckers disgrace me
I make money, but the money don't make me
Niggas like you be always acting so flaky
Chess while you running round your hood, don't shake ya
Crowd puts it down on the level above
It's international called Illtown love
Witness this motherfucker, just turn the mic on
I spit this shit from my bitches who get they dyke on, rap pawns

[Hook x2 (Replace Jersey with Midwest on repeat)]

[Verse 3: Treach]
Cherry tops, some more cops, ooh where you goin'?
Creeping in somebody's house, six in the mornin'
Whoo, and they rolling deep with they gats in they hands
With they warrants, canine, and they battering rams
Somebody done got them mad
Pigs rolling through my front, feds strolling through my back
If Vin move the llello, continue to lay low
You try to fuck me, now you bend over, pendejo
Could've been on the payroll, but you wanna play bro
So motherfuck you, and tell the captain I say so
I'll show you the master, you dick riding bastard
My lawyer's so good, you gonna be working in Alaska
