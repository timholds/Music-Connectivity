[Hook]
We can do it in the bed, on the floor
We can do it in the shower, we can do it with the lights on
We can do it in kitchen, or the car
Put my panties to the side, I'm tryna take you out the friend zone

[Verse 1]
Now see normally, I do not do this shit
But ooh, I'm so ready to do your shit
Throw it back for ya cause you know the deal
When I hit ya back with that Netflix and chill, yeah
Let me tell you how I want it
Tell you just the way to hit when you tryna push up on it
I ain't tryna hear you tell me that you're coming
Cause I'm tryna go for rounds and then end it in the morning
We ain't gotta cuddle, that ain't really been my thang
I already fell it gripping nigga in my ring
I see you wanted me, ain't gotta play no games
And normally we take this sober but so you know

[Pre-Hook]
Ride these hips like some handle bars
Do it on top of the car
No matter baby, I don't care
We can fuck anywhere
Ride these hips like some handle bar
Do it on top of the car
No matter baby, I don't care
We can fuck anywhere

[Hook]
We can do it in the bed, on the floor
We can do it in the shower, we can do it with the lights on
We can do it in kitchen, or the car
Put my panties to the side, I'm tryna take you out the friend zone

[Verse 2]
Now see normally I do not do this shit
Oh baby, I'm 'bout to take that dick
Throw it back for ya cause you know the deal
When I hit ya back with that Netflix and chill

[Bridge]
Here we are all alone, you and me
Privacy
And we can do anything
Your fantasy
I wanna make your dreams come true

[Pre-Hook]
Ride these hips like some handle bars
Do it on top of the car
No matter baby, I don't care
We can fuck anywhere
Ride these hips like some handle bars
Do it on top of the car
No matter baby, I don't care
We can fuck anywhere
