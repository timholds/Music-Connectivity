[Intro]
Black Lolita!
Black Lolita!

[Strophe 1]
Black Lolita, you're not a creature of god
Black Lolita, you have been sent from the dark
Black Lolita, came to seduce and to trap
Black Lolita, apples of Eden in straps

I wanna penetrate your lips, your hips, your heart
I wanna do you in the backyard skid row
I wanna love you in your parents bedroom
You look so innocent but you're the devil

[Chorus]
Black Lolita! I am a slave to your love
Lolita! I am a slave
A slave to your love

[Bridge]
Black! Black!
Lolita!       (x4)

[Strophe 2]
I wanna beat inside your chest, your breast, your heart
I wanna crawl under your skin and explode
I wanna pick you up when school is over
You give a helping hand but you're so evil

[Chorus]


[Strophe 3]
(And she tells me)
I don't care, I don't care how old you are
You are a slave to my love
I don't care, I don't care how old you are
You will obey when I beg you to
Fuck me hard

[Chorus (x2)]

[Bridge]
