[Verse 1]
Since you've gone, my heart said something's wrong
How long can this keep going on?
I'm still blue over losing you
What else am I going to do?

[Chorus]
I'm building bridges straight to your heart
An' all of this distance won't keep us apart
Won't keep us apart

[Verse 2]
Talk to me, talk to me about sympathy
Don't leave me begging on my knees
Since you've gone, my heart says something's wrong
How long can this keep going on?

[Chorus][x4]
