I've been in a hole I think it's time to come out
You've been in a hole you better come out too
We been lying low a cold fire in the soul
Dandelion pushing thru the snow
When you get to the bottom, held down
Won't stop seems like life squeezed out of you
Had next to nothing for a long time
Almost something for a little while
I've been wainting under ground a long time
To see you Flower
I've been in a hole I think it's time to come out
You've been in a hole you better come out too
We been lying low a cold fire in the soul
Dandelion pushing thru the snow
