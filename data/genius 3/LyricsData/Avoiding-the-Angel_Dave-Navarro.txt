I never wanted you to live here
I only asked if you would stay
I never minded that you slept here
I thought that you would go away
I never minded talking to you
Can I only turn you off?
I can't remember talking to you

Driving by the place with the books
It's a nice day for a parade
Seven times near the place with the books

I never really even loved you
I'm just really insecure
I never really even cared
Never tasted that pure
I don't think I ever liked you
I just had some time
I don't think I'd be that sorry

Driving by the place with the books
It's a nice day for a parade
Seven times near the place with the books

Living with you is a shade of gray
We never had anything to say
Anyway
Living with you is a shade of gray
Everyday

You never listened to me
And you never had the time
I thought that I knew you angel
You make me want to die
You never listened to me
And you never had the time
We never loved each other
And I'm always making you cry
