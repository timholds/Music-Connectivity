Bodacious woman
As fine as can be
You put a hurting on a man anytime that you please/(repeat)

I peeped you queen
Such a gleeful scene
I dream to bring you back to my family tree
Not celebrated cause your mind to elevated
Meditated success drawn out but they never trace it
Got three degrees guys think you cold hearted
Exceeded expectations and old targets
First in the family to go to college
Promise to  never sleep cause ya mind so conscious
Never showed much attention when you young
Boys was dumb nose was in the books
Corner crooks was numb
In the slum born to cook for funds
But you wasn’t easy to hook
Never rode the waves of the pond
Beauty truly understated
Corporate world testing your patience
The bosses eyes glide so you feeling naked
Asking is that your real hair
Never asked on date but they still stare
In a field where boss coppin feels up in ya space
But you ain't being fast with no minute man to win the race
Bible told you that ya place was in the kitchen
You spreading food for thought on another mission

They lied
Cause woman you is my queen
They lied
And your so sexy to me
They lied
Your making my heart shake
They Lied
Cause they can't handle your brains (2)
Yes Lord

All my educated woman wit a house and a car let me see where ya at don’t ya work so hard
All my classy ladies such a role model
Keep it all together never chasing no ballers

Double standards nothing but trouble handed
Trying to stay abreast while ducking the cancers
Taking trips to Ghana trying to change the world
You made partner but they still see you as a little girl
Many died so they could dream peace
Still a price paid for what seem free
Patriarchy be patronizing
A hateful science that denies greatness rising
But this year appears fateful triumphs
I be dreaming I'm with you
Milk chocolate skin heart dropping quick
Flawless glow with a slight almond tone
Such a solemn sole blossoms so
Trying to get a piece of the pie but the piranhas know
Curves of ya tresses blesses ya silk dresses
So u never run when it rains cause you hard to process
Want to help every cause maybe you naive
Or only you know the power you can achieve
I grieve at the death of your type
So I breath deep at the def of ya minds site
Allah's might
Conversations infinite durations
Planning strategizing
Enchanting you magnetizing
Matriarchy was thriving nourished in Africa
Puritans want purist of the gamet cause they can't handle us
You speak sight see the voice and hear the vision
So I rejoice when you appear cause I'm near God's precision


They lied
Cause woman you is my queen
They lied
And your so sexy to me
They lied
Your making my heart shake
They Lied
Cause they can't handle your brains (2)
Yes Lord
