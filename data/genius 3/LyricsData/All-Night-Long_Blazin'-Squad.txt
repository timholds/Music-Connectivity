Don't stop 'till we hit it up
We make the drop
Tonight we gonna turn it up
Woah
We gon' been doing it all night long
Gon' be getting this party on

Im like a diamond in the dirt waitin to be cleaned up
We in the club just sippin and tearin the scene up
Chicks dippin, we be sippin no need for the mean mugs
Sweatin like we skinny dippin, and spendin the cream up
Checkin moves like the 2 step
That's how we do it
Let me show you how my crew rep
Gimme your digits we gon' kick it today
& I'm gon' rock it till the mornin girl what can I say

I came here to party
It don't matter what the weather
We still blaze it up because nobody does it better
We hit parties all across the world
Still rockin, still lovin them girls
Come on baby let me see you shake your money maker
Do it fast, do it slow, pop it like ya meant to
You wanna grind just gimme a sign
I'll be right here waitin baby
That's the line

[Chorus:]
Don't stop 'till we hit it up
We make the drop
Tonight we gonna turn it up
Woah
We gon' been doing it all night long
Gon' be getting this party on
DJ keep spinnin it once
Makin it hot
So keep on spinnin it once
Holla
We gon' been doing it all night long
Gon' be getting this party on

You know the kid be
High like a frizzbee
Gone nowhere so don't act like I'm history
Love the mic, step aside
When I'm ?
We can ride all night and get that whip misty
Yep, see where the chicks be
Wid the flow that be hot, still blingin on that blinky
Won't end til im low in the benz
Rollin round with my peeps
With a wallet full of fifties

I came here to party
It don't matter what the weather
We still blaze it up because nobody does it better
We hit parties all across the world
Still rockin, still lovin them girls
Come on baby let me see you shake your money maker
Do it fast, do it slow, pop it like ya meant to
You wanna grind just gimme a sign
I'll be right here waitin baby
That's the line

[Chorus:]
Don't stop 'till we hit it up
We make the drop
Tonight we gonna turn it up
Woah
We gon' been doing it all night long
Gon' be getting this party on
DJ keep spinnin it once
Makin it hot
So keep on spinnin it once
Holla
We gon' been doing it all night long
Gon' be getting this party on

Don't you give it up
(I said; Give it up, I said; Give it up)
Don't you give it up
(Give it up)
Tonight we gon' party

[Chorus:]
Don't stop 'till we hit it up
We make the drop
Tonight we gonna turn it up
Woah
We gon' been doing it all night long
Gon' be getting this party on
DJ keep spinnin it once
Makin it hot
So keep on spinnin it once
Holla
We gon' been doing it all night long
Gon' be getting this party on
