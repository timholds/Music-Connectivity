[Intro]
God, I hate these rappers
God, i hate them man
I really do
And they all act like such a little noob
A noob? Yes, that's what I just said, a noob
And they're all just so pathetic like
Like a noob
Yes, a noob

[Verse 1]
Eww these rappers are disgusting
They really ain't got nothing
Worth listening to, they're dissing who
They don't like, always fussing
I think it's immature
I think they're insecure
Rapping about how they got money
But really they're just poor
And why do they ear rappers
I eat cheese and crackers
I don't think these rappers understand
What hip-hop is really about
And they think that that's ok
But I say there's no way
And that's why I feel as if
I have the need to say hey

[Hook]
You (me)
You are such a noob (I am)
Yes you are and dude (what)
I don't think you're good at anything you do
Hey you (what)
I'm not done with you (why not)
Cause I still need to (to what)
Say I think that you are such a noob

[Verse 2]
Oh my God, what are you doing
You think that sound is soothing
It's not, it's so confusing
It's just ewwy, ewwy, ewwy
I knew it would come to this
So now I pump my fist
I'm about to make it pound right through the underground
And see to it that they won't be missed
Sorry about that, where was I
Oh yeah, that's right, they must die
You ask why I yell in most of my songs
Well for the most part it's because I
Can't stand half the music I hear
So then I lose it I fear
And now you understand why a looney little man
Has to do this song right here

[Hook]

[Bridge]
Hey noob
Such a noob you are
You are, you are a noob
And I don't think you're good at anything you do
Oh no, your music is so vile
Go practice for a while
Go on and run away and don't come back to play
Til there's no more need to say

[Hook]
