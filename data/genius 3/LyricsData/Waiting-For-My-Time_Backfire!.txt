Waiting for my time
Sick and tired of working hard
Sick and tired if struggling
Sick and tired ofslaving my days
And i still don't have a f..cking thing
Feels like i'm stuck and i can't get ahead
The things i want i just can't seem to get
My dreams keep going down the f..cking drain
Sometimes this game of life drives me insane
Waiting for my time...
Sick and tired of working hard
Sick and tired if struggling
Sick and tired of all these disappointments
That life keeps throwing at me
Waiting for my time
'till i will win this f..cking fight
'till i will be satisfied
'till i can leave my troubles behind
Waiting for my time
