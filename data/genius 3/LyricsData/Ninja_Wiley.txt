I can't stop her cause she's a 10
She took my breath away I'm trying to breathe again
If there's a girl you put above you should be with them
Moving like a ninja cause we musn't be seen

[Verse]
She finished with her man, she looking for a friend
She told him it was done cause he cheated on her again
So I pick up the pieces and I put 'em back again
She told me I can be it but I musn't tell her friend
Cause she don't want nobody trying to cheat on him again
I told her baby it's ok cause it's nothing to do with them
See we should never follow , we wanna set a trend
We take it to a level and we step it up again
She going wild

[Hook]
I can't stop her cause she's a 10
She took my breath away I'm trying to breathe again
If there's a girl you put above you should be with them
Moving like a ninja cause we musn't be seen

[Verse]
She holla'd at the kid, decided what we're doing
I'm chilling in her crib, riverside viewing
She does it kinda big, money in her pocket
She said she loves my hustle and she could never knock it
I kiss her on the lips , fruit punch kissing
It takes a couple minutes for the apple tends to kick in
Tell them we're having a bachelor party
And people only here cause we're happy and we're living
We're going wild

[Hook]
I can't stop her cause she's a 10
She took my breath away I'm trying to breathe again
If there's a girl you put above you should be with them
Moving like a ninja cause we musn't be seen

[Verse]
I'm moving like a don, and that's because I am
Because I had a vision, because I had a plan
And now my songs are frying, they sizzle in a pan
I like to meet new women, if they don't know who I am
I'm moving like a don, and that's because I am
I had a bigger vision , I had a bigger plan
And now my songs are frying, they sizzle in a pan
I like to meet new women, if they don't know who I am
I make them go wild

I can't stop her cause she's a 10
She took my breath away I'm trying to breathe again
If there's a girl you put above you should be with them
Moving like a ninja cause we musn't be seen

[Verse]
She's trying to get all on my good side, I've got the car but I couldn't ride
She's trying to get all on my good side, let me tell you why
She finished with her man, she looking for her friend
She told him it was done cause he cheated on her again
So I pick up the peices and I put 'em back again
She told me I can be it but I musn't tell her friend
Cause she don't want nobody trying to cheat on him again
I told her baby it's ok cause it's nothing to do with them
See we should never follow, we wanna set a trend
We take it to a level ad we ste it up again
She going wild

I can't stop her cause she's a 10
She took my breath away I'm trying to breathe again
If there's a girl you put above you should be with them
Moving like a ninja cause we musn't be seen
