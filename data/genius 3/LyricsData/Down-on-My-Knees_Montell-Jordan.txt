Say you like it, I wanna hear you
Baby, baby, baby, louder
Say you like it, tell me how you like it
Say you like it 'cause tonight you're getting it all, baby

Tell me you like it
Oh girl, you want it, lady
Do you want it? Then let me up on it
Do you like it? Is it good to you?
Oh, oh, no, no

You say you've got a man but he ain't home
It's getting late in the evening and he leaves you all alone
I can see that you're tempted, oh girl, to do somethin' wrong
And when my song played on the radio, now you wanna get it on

Girl, let me take off your stockings
I'll pull 'em down, pull 'em down real slow
Your body needs my attention
From your head to your baby toes

I know you're scared, I see you shaking
Your thighs are just aching for a good tongue spanking
A towel you need to get
'Cause it's all slippery when it's wet

'Cause I'm going down
(I'll go down on my knees)
Oh, I'm going down and do the things that you want me to
All the things that your man won't do, I'll do 'em
(I'll go down on my knees)

Said, I'm going down, going down, down
You know that I will do anything for you

So many ways we can do it
On your knees, on the floor, in the shower
And I won't stop till every drop's
Got you wanting me hour after hour

I'll taste your lips so let me kiss you around
'Til the kitty starts to give me that sweet, sweet sound
You've got a freak on your hands
You know that Montell demands to go down
(I'll go down on my knees)

Oh, do the things that you want me too
All the things that your man won't do, I'll do 'em, I'll do 'em
(I'll go down on my knees)
Said, "I'm going down, going down"
And I'll do, oh you want me to, oh baby, yeah
(I'll go down on my knees)

I'll make you weak in the knees
And I'll do the things that you want me to
And all the thing your man won't do, that I'll do
(I'll go down on my knees)
Said, I'm going down

Ohh, baby, are you ready? I'm going down
(I'll go)
When your man ain't taking care of business I'll go
(I'll go)

Don't you know I'm the one to keep you satisfied?
(Do the thing you want me to)
I'll do what you want me to
(All the things that your man won't do)
All the thing that your man won't do
(I'll go)

I'll, I'll go, baby
(I'll go down on my knees)
I said, I'll go, baby
I'm trying to satisfy, yeah
Girl, I know that you really like it, do you like it, baby?
(I'll go down on my knees for you)
Oh, I wanna satisfy you one hundred, baby

I'm gonna give you my all, starting tonight, baby
(I'll go down on my knees, I'll go)
Oh, it will be right, baby, oh
(Do the things that you want me to)
Turn of the lights, baby
(All the things that your man won't do)

Oh, he ain't coming home
(I'll go down on my knees, I'll go)
And that means we can take our time

Oh, that's what I plan to do tonight, take my time
(Do the things that you want me to)
(All the things that your man won't do)
Going down, baby, I'm going now
(I'll go down on my knees, I'll go)

(Do the things that you want me to)
Oh, it will be so right
(Do the things that you want me to)
Everything you want me to
(All the things that your man won't do)
I'm going down on you
(I'll go down on my knees, oh yeah)

Said, I'm going down, down, down, baby, oh
(Do the things that you want me to)
(All the things that your man won't do)
All the things that your man won't do
(I'll go down on my knees)
You know that I'll do it for you, oh baby
