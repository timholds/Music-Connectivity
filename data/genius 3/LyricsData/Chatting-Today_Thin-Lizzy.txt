I worked for the union and on my very first communion, you know
It never ever, ever, ever worked out right
So I spent the night sleepin' on the railway
I worked for the foundry and man my mind it nearly drowned
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
It never, it could never work out right
So I said "So long, amigo. Good night" and slept on the railway

The railway, there's no better way, ooh the railway
And it's nice to talk to you today

I worked for the miller, a very, very nice type of fell-a {fellow}
But I could see that it was never gonna work out right
So I split and spent the night sleeping on the railway
I worked in the subway arc, oh yeah, yeah
You know it never, no no never, no never no, ever no, worked out right
So I said "So long" and spent the night on the railway

The railway, give me a bottle of whiskey, ooh the railway
Ooh, there's nothin' like the railway

And I'd like to thank someone for mascara and good things that I done
And for the time ya spent and the friendship begun
And most of all starry nights on the railway
Ooh, I don't know no better way
Than just, ooh, lyin' back an' drifting away
I can hear it, I can hear it
