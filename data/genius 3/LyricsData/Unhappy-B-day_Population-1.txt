Today is your birthday and the cake
Is on fire

Send back those invitations
Ignore the infomation
There will be no partaking in this useless celebration

Won't sing that silly number
It makes me numb and number
Another reminder one step closer to six feet under

Today is your birthday and the cake
Is on fire

I'm an endangered species
Life is a fatal disease
The plot unfolds drastic changes take hold you're pushing 90

The genesis was easy
The end is hard to stomach
A real living human being can only take so much

Today is your birthday and the cake
Is on fire

Unhappy birthday to you

I should be optimistic
Somehow i must have missed it
The light at the end of the tunnel
Blinded me with vision

Send back those invitations
Ignore the information
There will be no partaking
In this useless celebration

Today is your birthday and the cake
Is on fire

Unhappy birthday

It's ok
Just relax
Make wish
Take a breath
There's a fire in the room
Blow it out your wish comes true
Except the one that keeps you young

Who gives a shit anyway
It's just another day
Don't want your gifts anyway
What a day
Who gives a shit anyway
It's just a piece of cake
It makes me sick anyway

What a day
