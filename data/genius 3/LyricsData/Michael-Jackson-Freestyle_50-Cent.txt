[Verse 1]
They say I ain't lyrical, they say I ain't a miracle
I say some hard shit so they say I ain't spiritual
They act like they know God better than me
I know God Allah, he used to pump crack up the street
Allahu Akbar, clap him, run through your backyard
Let the Mac off, tear half off your back off
This is my block, my spot, I am here
I'm a South Side nigga 'till the bone, get that clear
Now I got a better hustle so I'm getting better bread
Buy my bitches better shit so they give me better head
You thinking about getting down with me, yeah, you better kid
Where the fuck you gon' get a job? You a predicate
Felon, it's back to crack sellin'
Nigga get caught telling the show, crack the melon
I told you I'd blow, now you see it to believe it
My head gassed up, man, I'm so conceited
Nigga, you ain't never gonna see me in the hood
Motherfuck that shit, nigga, I'm too good
Run tell niggas 50's bougie
You don't buy his CD's and don't go see his movies
He don't act like he used to in Juve'
He was on the medication, that nigga there loony

[Bridge]
Can it be I been away too long?
I mean way too long

[Verse 2: Michael Jackson]
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at
You don't have to worry cause I'm coming
Back to where I should have always stayed
And now I've heard the maybe to your story
And it's enough love for me to stay
Can it be I stayed away too long?
Did I leave your mind when I was gone?
It's not my thing trying to get back
But this time let me tell you where I'm at

[Hook: Michael Jackson]
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Anywhere you are
I wanna, wanna be where you are
Everywhere you are
