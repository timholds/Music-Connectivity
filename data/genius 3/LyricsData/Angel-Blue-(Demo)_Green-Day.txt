Gonna build it up just to burn it down
You're a princess, i'm a fucking clown
Stop the presses 'cause i'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine?

You're just a fucking kid and no one ever gives you a break
You want a senorita well now your heart is gonna break
You're Angel Blue with teenage traces
Angel Blue with pretty faces

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Now i'm singing out the alphabet
As my tears are putting out my cigarette

We'll hit the cemetery so we can see the holiday lights
Waking up dead and everything'll be alright
You're Angel Blue with teenage traces
Angel Blue with pretty faces

All right!
Stuck in the middle of heaven and hell
All right!
Trying to find my better angels!

Stab my heart like a stick in the mud
Cut my chest just to see the blood
Stop the presses 'cause i'm killing time
Won't you be my bloody valentine?

You're just a fucking kid and no one ever gives you a break
You want a senorita well now your heart is gonna break
You're Angel Blue with teenage traces
Angel Blue with pretty faces
