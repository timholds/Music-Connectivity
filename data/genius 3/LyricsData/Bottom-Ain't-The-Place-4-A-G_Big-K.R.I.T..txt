[Hook x2]

When it's all said and done they gonna see me on top
With a deal and meal twenty fours on the drop
Street boys I'm a get it I'm the K-R-I-T
And the bottom of the game ain't the place for a G

[Verse 1]
Aye I'm back ho stay on my grind
Tight as my buzz and then pass out
Crooks and jackers coming to snatch you through you backdoor
If you want kings then it's that 'Krizzle that you ask for
No one attended none of your parties or your last show
Niggas this slick I keep that biscuit in my dash vault
Money's a river and can't no man up in my care flow
Keep my business composed and talk for a little though
Tell all them fams they having running with the task force
CD don't sell but it shelves if you don't grind
Haters so tarnished by all their snitching that they don't shine
Practice my pimping so when I'm pimping man it's going down
Either in mine or in your city or your nearest town
Shaking the block so much that these motherfuckers hear me now
Hear me from underneath so that mean that I'm still underground
Really don't bother me because they're still gonna represent a G
If I don't blow today I'll just get mine in the south scene

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]

Aye I'm back ho stay on my rhymes
Tight as my buzz and then I get stacked
Quicker than niggas with smart mouths get their domes cracked
Keeping my folk that's from Mississippi like I'm supposed to
If I don't share with you niggas that's means I don't know you
Tricked out colliders shit really phases me never ever nigga
Plenty of niggas rapping but clearly I am better nigga
Boy in the hood I 'puts' it down for the whole block
Niggas in tracks and then that makes them want to close the shop
Hate to the bearer of bad news but you ain't me
Spit out them rhymes and on top of that I make beats
Nigga the wrists I'll be the next artist to sign a deal
Put me some twenty fours on that lick it and cop a billion green
Showing my ass because when I smash niggas better gone
Why would I need a man the street's got my back 'cuh'
I got potential to have the mix tape of the century
If I don't blow today I just get mine on the south scene

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3]

Aye this ain't a game, motherfucker like you thought it was
Niggas don't compare to the K, they don't ball enough
Because all the animosity they pile it all
The game's like some pussy, nigga y'all getting swallowed up
Because they know I'll have your back all night hard
And It's gonna cost shit, your rap it's not bars
You couldn't blow if you had Hov on track, T.I., Nas, Young Jeezy
And the Holy Ghost on track, and if they did the hook, and Pharrell aced a beat
Every boss gangster crip'll pumped up a grave street
Y'all niggas must be tripping he going farther than these groups
Y'all niggas entertain but I really make music
I really can't do this I'm respected for mine
They don't care how much it cost they just want me to sign
If I let a rap city take their votes in the streets
I'm the figure on my time, and you sound like (some) mayor links
