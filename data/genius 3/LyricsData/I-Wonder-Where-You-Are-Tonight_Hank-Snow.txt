Tonight I'm sad my heart is weary I'm wondering if I'm wrong or right
Although you've gone and found another I wonder where you are tonight

That old rain is cold and slowly falling upon my window pane tonight
And though your love was even colder I wonder where you are tonight

Your heart was cold you never loved me though you said you often cared
And now you've gone and found another someone to know the love I've shared
That old rain is cold...
[ fiddle - steel ]
Then came the dawn the day you left me I tried to smile with all my might
But you could see the pain within me that lingers in my heart tonight
That old rain is cold...
