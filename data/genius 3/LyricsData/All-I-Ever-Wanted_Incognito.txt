[Verse 1]
I step away
You draw me back
A compromise that I'll despise
The truth concealed by
Royal pretense
My fate is set
I will regret

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I ever wanted
Was just to be needed
Needed by you

[Chorus]
From the day we started
Should have known this love was blighted
'Cause all we ever do is undo

[Verse 2]
You do your worst
I spit my curse
I bare the scars of your embrace
Oh the pain
Concealed by a love immense
This disconnect I won't forget

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I ever wanted was just to be needed
Needed by you

[Chorus]
From the day we started
Should have known this love was blighted
'Cause all we ever do is undo

[Bridge]
The first kiss was an apocolypse
Revealing more than I bargained for
Forbidden fruit
You were never mine
Oh, what was I to do

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I ever wanted
Was just to be needed
To be needed by you

[Chorus]
From the day we started
Should have known this love was blighted
'Cause all we ever do is undo

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I ever wanted
Was just to be needed
To be needed by you

Yes I did

[Chorus]
From the day we started
Should have known this love was blighted
'Cause all we ever do is undo

Oh yeah ah ah
