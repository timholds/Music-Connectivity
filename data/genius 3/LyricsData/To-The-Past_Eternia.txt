[Verse]:
We can't all be perfect
Some people think I'm dope, I don't think I deserve it
I've been learning how to be a woman of grace
But it's hard when the past keeps rearing it's face
I was never one to think before I said or I did
I said things that hurt you, did things I regret
And just when I think, "Have I passed that yet?"
I'm tempted and I'm brought right back there again
I nested you, I shouldn't have done it
I hated myself for having no conscious, felt like a puppet
You held the strings while I plummet
Deeper into this Hell, a story to tell and yet I learned from it
I wouldn't be here now if I didn't fall then
So I thank you for giving me the need to repent
And I hope you know I was wrong what I did
But I ask for forgiveness now for all my sins
