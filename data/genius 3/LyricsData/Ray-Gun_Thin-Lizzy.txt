I know someone
Who doesn't believe in God
Someone I know doesn't even know God

He came from a planet three thousand miles away
Just a short trip
A kind of brief holiday

Can you give someone somewhere to stay
I gotta warn you, he's gotta gun
I gotta warn you, he's gotta gun

I know someone who came on a short trip
Travelling lightly
Travelling by spaceship

He came from a planet three thousand miles away
Can you give someone somewhere to stay
I gotta warn you, he's gotta gun

Please look out woman
A ray gun!
