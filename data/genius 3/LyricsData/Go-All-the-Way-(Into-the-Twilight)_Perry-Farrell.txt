Everyday, everyday, everyday
We're going all the way

Everyday, everyday, everyday
We're going all the way
We're going all the way
We're going all the way

Everyday, everyday, everyday
We're going all the way
Everyday, everyday, everyday
We're going all the way

Tonight
Lightning strikes
Let's go into twilight

First time I saw you
(When we first met)
I had the fever
(As bad as it gets)
You let me see
(Much in my eyes)
It was so smooth, sparkle and shine
And it shined

Oh!
La la la la...

Tonight
Lightning strikes
Let's go into twilight

You asked me out on many dates
And took me to exotic places
You saw the look upon your face
You men must really love the chases
I'm going to let you have it like you've never had before
So take me
Take me
Take me...

Tonight
Lightning strikes
Let's go into twilight

Go all the way with me, go all the way
Go all the way with me, go all the way
Go all the way with me, go all the way
Go all the way with me, go all the way
Go all the way with me, go all the way
Go all the way with me, go all the way
Go all the way with me, go all the way
Go all the way with me, go all the way
Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday
We're going all the way
