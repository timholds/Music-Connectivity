[Hook]
Finna throw the whole game outta focus
Beat it in the head cause the flow sick FV
I'm finna throw the whole game outta focus
Beat it in the head cause the flow sick let em know
We don’t never fade away, we just keep on moving
And we ain’t afraid of bitch nigga’s talking slick act up and you can get it
So sit down and pay attention nigga

[Verse 1: SwizZz]
Z Z z Heangh, I ain’t in the building I’m base jumping off of it
It's Swizzle bitch time to take my balls out your esophagus
I took a break and became a topic of all the gossiping
Dummies taking shots and get mad because I don’t acknowledge em yep
Starting in '08 and still ain’t fucking dropped an album
Circumstances have set me back and I’m buzzing with out one
Perceived as the hype man in the back
But I’m a founder of this shit and now look where its at huh
I'll let u have it like I’m generous nigga
Shit my existence alone is such a benefit nigga
Rewind the clock a couple years I’m still ahead of you nigga’s
It's 2013 I’m making beds for you niggas
To sleep soundly 3 Z’s ho
I’m in the booth letting it spill, BP flow
Punchlines knock em out like Deebo,
You nigga’s ain’t ready to stop me from running to Tim Tebow ohh boy!

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Dizzy Wright]
Yo greatly awakened I’m coming straight outta Vegas
Beside from taking over we planning assassinations
The craft I’m taking I’m poetry in the matrix
We know the industry fake and we slowly about to break it
See they embrace it cause Hop was just in his basement he secretly hired killers that's killing collaborations
2012 I put this shit back to the roots
Shit bag with yo bitch act you can get trapped in a booth
Hardest out, I’m hardly out but talking bout stoner out the group my home smell like Bob Marley’s house
I found it out and you can count me out, these rappers weak y’all lyrics dryer than cotton mouth
The problem child you surprised that I’m next
Nigga said he going global and I swear that I ain’t lied to you yet
Labels calling cause they trying to invest
It's 2013 and the first thing they ask is we signing a check? Nahhh

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Jarren Benton]
Jarrrron Bennnnton
Hello y’all it’s the bully
In a Trayvon Martin hoodie
And a bunch of gynecology tools to operate on you pussies
Ain’t no killer but please don’t push me,
The day you fags belittle me
Is the day that Hopsin joins a group with Soulja Boy and Lil B
Overseas they call me a sick cunt
I’m hungry and I just missed lunch
Fuck an FV 2013 song dang the world ends this month,
I’m crazy as Big Pun on a fifth of rum
Storm in the house pissed cause his wife hid all his sharp knives and his gun
I kill a nigga for Hop, SwizZzle, Dizzy, and Dame
Or Hoppa this ain’t a label bitch this is a gang SIKE
Let me not say that all the fans will be like "Hop, you a hypocrite
Why'd you sign Jarren? He's ignorant!"
I ain’t going nowhere, get used to me
FV ain’t what it used to be
Cause we making moves about to hit the top, shining just like jewelry, Yeah, fuck you haters who ain’t with it
And you labels that shitted homie we did it independent bitch!

[Hook]

[Verse 4: Hopsin]
(Yeah, Hopsin check me out yo)
This was something that you couldn't prevent
I threw my fucking life away to get my foot in this bitch
I see some dedicated haters and they looking to diss,
I know the fucking solution and ass whooping is it
I got the industry all shooken and stiff
Since I ain't loan 'em my soul you know it's something that they wouldn't admit
I made a change and the devil said I shouldn’t commit
But the lifestyle he offers ain’t as good as it gets
Man I ain’t just another rapper on the list
Mackin' on the chicks doing big collabs every track tone a hit
I’m the captain of the ship
Plus I’m back upon my shit
Take a note of it and stick it to a magnet on your fridge
So yo asses don’t forget that my purpose is astronomic (nahh)
I enlighten those who hurting and lacking knowledge
The burden is bad to pocket I’m certain I had to stop it
The fire is burning but I’m emerging through ashes falling
My image made all you folks doubt
But I made it through the vicious cold drought
Now all you niggas get to see my flow sprout,
Sorry mama but I gotta roll now, I done made some cheese
Now I can finally afford my own house,
I see niggas speaking on shit that they don’t know about
I excel in places they failed so they think I sold out (shit)
But this is what the fame does we came up
And made our name buzz and now they mad cause they ain’t us
