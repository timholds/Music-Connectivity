The splendor of the King
Clothed in majesty
Let all the earth rejoice
All the earth rejoice

He wraps himself in light
And darkness tries to hide
And trembles at His voice
And trembles at His voice

How great is our God
Sing with me
How great is our God
And all will see
How great, how great
Is our God

Age to age He stands
And time is in His Hands
Beginning and the end
Beginning and the end

The Godhead, Three in one
Father, Spirit, Son
The Lion and the Lamb
The Lion and the Lamb

Name above all names
Worthy of our praise
My heart will sing how great
Is our God
