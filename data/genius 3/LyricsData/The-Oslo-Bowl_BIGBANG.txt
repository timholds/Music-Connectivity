Well I used to think my life was supposed to be, supposed to be
The tale of a guy who got out of here, out of here
Tried to leave the cold, get away from the dark
Left my home, and went to Echo Park
Where I could be another lonely golden god in California
Hey now, fight the cold
Gonna burn, gonna rise and rock and roll
Hey now, we got fire and oil
Digging a hole in the Oslo Bowl
Then she came out in the summertime, summertime, ye summertime
Said the people over here really blew her mind, blew her mind
Let's get crazy like the midnight sun, have lots of fun, lots of fun
They have a lot of nice girls over there, dancing around in no underwear
Singing hey now, fight the cold
Gonna burn, gonna rise and rock and roll
Hey now, gonna melt the pole
Digging a hole in the Oslo Bowl
Hey now, fight the cold
Gonna burn, gonna rise and rock and roll
Hey now, we got fire and oil
Digging a hole in the Oslo Bowl
Ain't nothing but a earthquake
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Hey now, fight the cold
Gonna burn, gonna rise and rock and roll
Hey now, we got fire and oil
Digging a hole in the Oslo Bowl
Hey now, fight the cold
Gonna burn, gonna rise and rock and roll
Hey now, gonna melt the pole
Dig another hole in the Oslo Bowl
Hey now. Hey now
Hey now. Hey now
Hey now. Hey now
Hey now. Hey now
Hey now. Hey now
