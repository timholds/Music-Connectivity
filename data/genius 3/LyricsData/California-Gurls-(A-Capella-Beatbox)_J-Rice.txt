I know a place
Where the grass is really greener
Warm, wet and wild
There must be something in the water
Sippin' gin and juice
Laying underneath the palm trees
The boys
Break their necks
Try'na to creep a little sneak peek

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
They're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
They're melt your popsicle
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
They're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

Sex on the beach
They're don't mind sand in there stilettoes
They're freak
In there jeep
Playing songs on there stereo

You could travel the world
But nothing comes close
To the golden coast
Once you party with us
You'll be falling in love
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
They're unforgettable
Daisy Dukes
Bikinis on top
Sun-kissed skin
So hot
They're melt your popsicle
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
They're undeniable
Fine, fresh, fierce
We got it on lock
West coast represent
Now put your hands up
Oooooh Oh Oooooh

California girls
