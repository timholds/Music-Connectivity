Intro/Chorus: Blue Raspberry

You left me here, alone, with a shine
All hope was gone, I couldn't find
My world alone, how could I break my home
Still I doubted you, and still your strength
Enchanted me, you was a father to my child
And a man to me, now I'm so lost
Strong hearts, run free
Run free, young hearts
Young hearts, run free
Run free, young hearts

[Cappadonna]
Girlfriend, what you did was wrong
Even though the love was strong, you moved on
Never had faith in the Don, you was safe
With the Don, and then you walked out
A broken house, a broken heart
Cry for my dart, we had a plan
We was woman and man, the hourglass
Held the sand, I held you like contraband
But you didn't understand when the four devils
Came inside of your life that night
We argued and fight, you knew it wasn't right
Fucked up our life, my thoughts come stronger
Every ounce, it's not my fault
That you wanted to bounce, now you tellin me
That you cleaned up your act, beep me every time
But I never call back, that's how I felt
When you was makin me crack
Me leave wifey for you??

I'm crying
I'm crying

Chorus

[Blue Raspberry]
Young hearts, run free
Run free, young hearts
Young hearts, run free...
