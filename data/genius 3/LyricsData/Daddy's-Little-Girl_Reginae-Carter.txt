I'm daddy's little girl
Daddy's little baby
He will never leave even though
I drive him crazy Until I get older
I'm on daddy's shoulders
Yeah!
That's my daddy!
Yeah that's my daddy-daddy

Daddy brought me in this world
Told me I could pursue it Walked me though these steps
Showed me that I could do it
Life's a brick wall
But you can run through it
Cause every obstacle daddy already moved it
Don't let the world hit ya
Just paint it like a picture
And never ever let the rude boys come and get ya
Eyes on the prize keep your head high
And always remember that the limit is the sky

Chorus:
Cause I'm daddy's little girl
Daddy's little baby
He would never leave meeven though I drive him crazy
Until I get older
I'm on daddy's shoulders
Yeah!
That's my daddy!
Yeah that's my daddy-daddy
Cause I'm daddy's little girl
Daddy's little baby
Daddy ain't gonna leave even though I drive him crazy
Until I get older
I'm on daddy's shoulders
Yeah!
That's my daddy!
Yeah that's my daddy-daddy
Daddy's set the bar
Told him I'd do my part
Just like my daddy I'mma finish what I start
Daddy said 'Put you soul, I put you to the heart'
His words stay close even though he's so far
Cause this world's so cold, and it's getting colder
Shake them haters off
See them bubble like a soda
I ain't searching for promoters
Cause daddy's my promoter
Momma told me to be lady-like
And daddy always quoted her

Cause I'm daddy's little girl
Daddy's little baby
He would never leave even though I drive him crazy
Until I get older
I'm on daddy's shoulders
Imam stick with daddy cause this world is getting colder
Cause I'm daddy's little girl
Daddy's little baby
Daddy ain't gonna leave even though I drive him crazy
Until I get older
I'm on daddy's shoulders
Yeah!
That's my daddy!
Yeah that's my daddy-daddy

Hopping like a rolling stone Can't go worng, wrong,wrong,wrong
And they see none
Have a little fun
Tell me what you taste along
Getting number one
Daddy never tear no one
And you can even win number one
And I can never say another one

Cause I lookup for your guidance
Everywhere I go they tryin'
Back to reality
Back to reality

Cause I'm daddy's little girl
Daddy's little baby
He would never leave even though I drive him crazy
Until I get older
I'm on daddy's shoulders
Imam stick with daddy cause this world is getting colder
Cause I'm daddy's little girl
Daddy's little baby
Daddy ain't gonna leave even though I drive him crazy
Until I get older
I'm on daddy's shoulders
Yeah!
That's my daddy!
Yeah that's my daddy-daddy
I'm daddy's little girl
Daddy's little baby
Until I get older
I'm on daddy's shoulders
