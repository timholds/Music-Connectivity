[Verse 1]
Where did all the people go?
They got scared
When the lights went low
I'll get you through it nice and slow
When the world's spinning out of control
Afraid of what they might lose
Might get scraped
Or they might get bruised
You could beg them, what's the use?
That's why it's called a moment of truth, yeah

[Chorus]
I'll get it if you need it
I'll search if you don't see it
You're thirsty I'll be rain
You get hurt I'll take your pain
I know you don't believe it
But I said it and I still mean it
When you heard what I told you
When you get worried
I'll be your soldier

[Verse 2]
Funny when times get hard
At the last moment when you're supposed to charge
We're always on the longest yard
Oh, they feel their feet getting cold
Hiding here hiding there
Find them underneath the stairs
People hiding everywhere
Trynna be still as a stone, but

[Chorus]
I'll get it if you need it
I'll search if you don't see it
You're thirsty I'll be rain
You get hurt I'll take your pain
I know you don't believe it
But I said it and I still mean it
When you heard what I told you
When you get worried
I'll be your soldier

[Bridge]
My aim is so true
I wanna show you
I'll try forever
I'm never gonna say surrender

[Chorus]
I'll get it if you need it
I'll search if you don't see it
You're thirsty I'll be rain
You get hurt I'll take your pain
I know you don't believe it
But I said it and I still mean it
When you heard what I told you
When you get worried
I'll be your soldier

[Outro]
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na (I'll be your soldier)
Na na na na na na na na (Well I'll be)
Oh I'll be your soldier (na na na na na na na)
Na na na na na na na na (La da da la da da da da)
Na na na na na na na na (I'll be your soldier)
Na na na na na na na na
La da da da da

La da da da da da
La da da da da da da da
