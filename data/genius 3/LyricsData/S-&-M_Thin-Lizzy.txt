She walked out of a shady motel
Into the arms of a sugar daddy
Oh she'd been having a good time
Oh but she loved her daddy madly

She said, daddy, what can I do
I want to spend my time making love to you
But her daddy had to run, hit and run
Now he's gone

S&M

This customer was shady
He kept a rubber hose
He liked to beat the ladies
There's nothing wrong with that I suppose
"Yes, there is"

He made them want to shout, "Ouch"
But this time you better watch out
He kicked her
Oh and he beat her and he whipped her

S&M
He beat her black and blue

He just liked the violence
Said it made him tough
He just liked the violence
Said she couldn't get enough, couldn't get enough

S&M
He beat her like a drum

This fetish could be foolish
It could lead to something dangerously reckless
To hold your lover helpless
Could lead to something called a mess

You like to be tacky and kinky
Sleazy and slinky
To make them want to shout, "Ouch"
Fight back and scratch out

S&M
Do it again
