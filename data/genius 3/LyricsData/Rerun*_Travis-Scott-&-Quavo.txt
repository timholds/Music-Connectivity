[Hook: Travis Scott & Quavo]
She like it, I'm swipin'
I fight it, she dykin'
Mmmmm
I had to come right back like double back and rerun
I had to do right back like do it back and she lyin'
She like the swipin'
I slide it, she dykin'
I had to come right back like double back and rerun
I had to do right back like double back and rerun

[Verse 1: Travis Scott & Quavo]
Yeah, go ahead spend it, Iâ€™m live in it
Yeah, my whip came with curtains, I don't need to tint it
Yeah, when it come to I she turn so independent, yeah
When it comes to this D she turn so damn dependent (straight up)
Night times from a time cold
You really wanna say yes but you sayin' no
I won't stop by my gang like I can't goI let her drug the ring then she Rick the Rose
Yeah, ice ice biting Cartier Bangles
Yeah, she let me smash her friends 'long as the chain froze
Yeah, ain't been here 15 minutes why she changed clothes
She right with me through the city while we slayin' dough (Straight up)
Slide through the hood pop up on the north (yeah, yeah)
You know everything go when you reach the show
