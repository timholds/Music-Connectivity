Mas que nada
Black Eyed Peas came to make it hotter
We be the party starters
Bubblin' up just like lava
Like lava heated like a sauna
Penetrating through your body armor
Rhythmically we massage ya
With hip hop mixed up with samba
With samba so yes yes y'all
You know we never stop
We never rest y'all
The black eyed peas are keeping it funky fresh y'all
And we won't stop until we get y'all, til we get y'all sayin'

Oaria raio

Heavy rotation played by every kind
Radio stations blastin' every mind
We crossing boundaries like everyday
To rock ya robbie bobbie beamer on the bay
We got we got tab magnification tab magnified

The black eyed peas will keep it funky fresh y'all
And we won't stop until we get y'all, til we get y'all sayin

Drop hot hot be my daily operation
Got to put it work in this crazy occupation
Gotta keep it movin' that's the motivation
Gotta ride the waves and keep a tight relation
With my team keeping moving and doing it right
I've been in a lab every day til daylight
That's the way things move in this monkey business
We took a old samba song and remixed it

Mas que nada
Sai da minha frente
Eu quero passar
Pois o samba esta animado
O que eu quero e sambar
Este samba
Que e misto de maracatu
E samba de preto velho
Samba de preto tu
