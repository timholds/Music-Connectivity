(Verse one)

I wanted this to special, something more
Than any other feeling that you felt before
Pushin through the doors I see girls
Havin' a good time, I might say a rhyme
Old school, new school, no school rule
But other than that, everything is cool
I see guys and girls dancin', doin' the new dances
That's a hit,while I'm over here romancin'
You ain't shh.....no need to curse
Ask me who she is and let me tell you first
Slow down, be cool and don't act ill
I came to have a good time, party and chill with you
Don't worry sweetheart I'm still with you
And after we leave we will continue
With our plans
But plans are made to be broken
Smokin', I'm not jokin'
Try to Dis'me and I'll give you a token
Cause I'm the type of brother that can't be stopped
And no matter what I'm gonna

Keep risin' to the top (Sampler intro)
While my mind say

( CHORUS)
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got
Ain't no half steppin'
Give it all you got, give it all you got
Cause we're the Get Fresh Crew, yeah, yeah......

(Verse two)

Now the music is pumpin', good atmosphere
Chill Will and Barry Bee, they must a beat me here
There in the booth
Which is all sound proof
Playn' "dope" jams to rock the youth
But the MC on the mic shouted out
We got the Get Fresh Crew stars in the house
And as the crowd started breakin', I didn't reply
Cause the only stars I know are in the sky
So we continued,to the venue
Didn't pretend to be nuthin' but Doug E
As a brother extended out his hand to me
And asked me would I rock the microphone
I just gave him a pound and said Shalom
Sharp as a harp played by a musician
My body tone, is like throne
Wearin Calvin Klein Obssession Cologne
Etc., etc., in a cashmere sweater
I'm in a cherokee, Chill Will in a Audi
And Barry Bee, is ridin' with me
Because we're the type of brothers that can't be stopped
And no matter what we're gonna

Keep risin' to the top (Sampler intro)
While my mind say

( Chorus)
Give it all you got, give it all you got, give it all you got
Ain't no half steppin'
Give it all you got, give it all you got
Keep risin' to the top

Now let the beat drop
