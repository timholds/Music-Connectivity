[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
Somewhere in your past
Someone said forever
But that promise didn't last
Now you don't believe
Love is ever true
Steel yourself against the day
When I stopped loving you

[Chorus]
When the day comes that I don't love you
Every star will fall out of the sky
And every mountain will tumble down
And every river run dry

[Verse 2]
Every drop of rain
That ever touched the ground
For every tear that ever fell
And never made a sound
I'll be there
To hear you call
And I'll be there to catch you baby
Should you ever fall

[Chorus][x2]
