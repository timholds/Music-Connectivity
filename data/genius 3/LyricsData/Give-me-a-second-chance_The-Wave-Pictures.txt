There's too much salt on these crackers
There's too much background in my mattress
And I can't seem to get any air into my lungs
What I did well, I threw myself down at your feet
Nights like this run up and down my street
Give me a second chance
Give me a second chance

Like the bats up there in the attic
I am flying I am frantic
And you know I know I look all washed to sea
What I did, well I threw myself down at your feet
Nights like this run up and down my street
Give me a second chance
Give me a second chance
Give me a second chance
Give me a second chance
