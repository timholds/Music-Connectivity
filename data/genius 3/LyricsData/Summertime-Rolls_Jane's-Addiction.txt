[Verse 1]
Fell into
A sea of grass
And disappeared among
The shady blades
The children all
Ran over me
Screaming tag
You are the one

[Verse 2]
He trips her as
Her sandals fail
She says stop
I’m a girl
Whose fingernails are made
Of a mother’s pearl
Yellow buttercup
Helicopters
Orange buttercat
Chasing after
The crazy bee
Mad about somebody
Oh no

[Chorus]
Me and my girlfriend
Don’t wear no shoes
Her nose is painted pepper sunlight
She loves me
I mean it’s serious
As serious can be

[Verse 3]
Well, she sings a song and
I listen to what it says
If you want a friend
Feed any animal
There was so much space
I cut me a piece
With some fine wine
It brought peace to my mind
In the summertime
And it rolled

[Bridge]
Summer... oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh... summertime rolls
Summer... oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh... summertime rolls
Oh summer... yeah yeah yeah
Oh oh oh, oh, oh... summertime rolls
Summer... yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
Oh, oh, oh… summertime rolls

[Chorus]
Me and my girlfriend
Don’t wear no clothes you know
I know her nose is a pepper sunlight
I love her
I mean it's so so serious
As serious can be
