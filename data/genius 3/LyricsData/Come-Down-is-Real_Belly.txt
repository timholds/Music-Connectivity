[Intro]
Never sleep I'm fucking tired of dreaming
Always smoking like I'm tired of breathing
Did it all, I could die this evening
Ran the devil round the block to exercise my demons

[Verse 1]
Bitches in the house that I just don't acknowledge
Kissed me on the mouth and said I'm going to college
Hit a dab, took cab money, forty dollars
You said you love me but you're so dishonest
Said you love me but you're so persuasive
You don't complain plus you're so complacent
You never fuss plus you're always tweaking
All you wanted was a dream house to fall asleep in

[Hook]
Too submissive, I was cruel and vicious with it
You believed in me like a new religion
Guess you Buddhist Christian, huh?
On a bed sitting cross-legged now
Higher than a Falsetto now

[Chorus]
I said I miss you, said I'm thinking of you
You ain't responding, guess I'm drinking for two
Come down is real, come down is real
Come down is real, come down is real
Oh, no

[Verse 2]
Room spinning, tryna kill the motion
Fuck feelings tryna kill emotion
Never loved but you came the closest
Even went to rehab, to me you're still the dopest
Shit's out of focus, I'm losing track of the moments
Lord
She drop down to her knees she ain't proposing
Lord
She stares at roses, always hurt like Derrick Rose
January cold, my bed warm like February clothes

[Hook]
Too submissive, I was cruel and vicious with it
You believed in me like a new religion
Guess you Buddhist Christian, huh?
On a bed sitting cross-legged now
Higher than a Falsetto now

[Chorus]
I sent a message, said I'm thinking of you
You ain't responding, guess I'm drinking for two
Come down is real, come down is real
Come down is real, come down is real
Oh, no
