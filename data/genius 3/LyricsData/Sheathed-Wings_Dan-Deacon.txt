[Verse 1]
I know you're a rhino bashing through the walls
You made them with your own hands and eyes
Strength shoots the arrow into the sky and mind sees
The wings and moves right to the side

[Chorus]
And when we see the lake we dive!
All the way off the rocks like there's no bottom
And I would love to know
What you've been thinking about

(Move a little bit closer)

[Verse 2]
You see the leaf and it's bleeding slowly
You ask the moon it understands
You stand on the edge of the desert screaming
You want to see sky turn into sand
Turn into sand

[Chorus]
And when we see the lake we dive!
All the way off the rocks like there's no bottom
And I would love to know
What you've been thinking about

(Move a little bit closer)
