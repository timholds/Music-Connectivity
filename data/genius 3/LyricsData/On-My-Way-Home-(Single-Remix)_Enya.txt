[Verse 1]
I have been given
One moment from heaven
As I am walking
Surrounded by night
Stars high above me
Make a wish under moonlight

[Chorus 1]
On my way home
I remember
All the good days
I'm on my way home
I can remember
Every new day

[Verse 2]
I move in silence
With each step taken
Snow falling round me
Like angels in flight
Far in the distance
Is my wish under moonlight

[Chorus 2]
On my way home
I remember
All the good days
On my way home
I remember
All the best days
I'm on my way home
I can remember
Every new day

[Refrain]
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up-up, Adieu
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up-up, Adieu

[Outro]
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up-up, Adieu)
On my way home
I remember
All the good days
(Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up-up, Adieu)
On my way home
I remember
All the best days
