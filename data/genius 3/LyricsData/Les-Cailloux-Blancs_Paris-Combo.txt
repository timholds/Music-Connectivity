CHORUS
Eh-oh, Eh-oh, can you hear me calling you?
Against the wind, my breath is scattered
Eh-oh, eh-oh, can you see them, these white stones?
Like pearls shining on my path
Lost in the dark forest, lost in my regrets
I try to return to the heart I loved
Even if, I remember now, it was he who led me
In the guise of a promenade, into this forest
CHORUS
Did you need it, did you really need courage
When the moment came to leave me?
Without a word, a look, a kiss? Nothing more…
You fled, I heard your wild running
CHORUS
And since then, I push deeper into this strange forest
I walk through it day and night
But if ever I look behind me
It’s because I think I hear the sound of your footsteps
CHORUS
