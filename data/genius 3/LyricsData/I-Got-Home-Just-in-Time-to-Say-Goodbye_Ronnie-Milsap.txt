I woke up a thousand miles from home this morning
Sweatin' from a bad dream that I had
I rode all night to get back home to you
I can't remember when I needed you this bad

And I got home just in time to see you leaving
And you walked out just in time to see me cry
What my eyes are seeing now I'm not believing
'Cause I got home just in time to say goodbye

There he was standing right next to our roses
A half way between the door and the gate
I walk through that man just like I didn't know him
'Cause after all a loser don't have much to say

And I got home just in time to see you leaving
And you walked out just in time to see me cry
What my eyes are seeing now I'm not believing
'Cause I got home just in time to say goodbye

'Cause I got home just in time to say goodbye...
