[Intro]
Paranoid, it's important
I don't-cautious
I don't know about them boy there
I ain't sure about them boy there
Paranoid-
Paranoid, it's important
Them boys are inform-

[Hook]
Paranoid, it's important
Them boys are informers
Link up but I'm cautious
I don't know about them boy there
I ain't sure about them boy there
Paranoid, it's important
Paranoid, it's important
'Formies

[Verse 1]
Paranoid, I mean booky
I don't care about no groupie
Phone's on and it's booming
I don't care about your music
Fuck my ex, I got new tings
Fuck my next, I've got two tings
I'm up again
Like 'Fuck a friend'
They weren't here when I was going through tings
Here when I was having problems
Here when I was out of options
Middle finger up, obnoxious
Fuck them niggas, make it obvious
I'm in the kitchen going bonkers
Donae'o whipping up the monsters
The realest nigga, fuck the Oscars
But I hope I win a Oscar

[Verse 2]
Paranoid, I ain't social
I don't talk on no phone calls
We ain't cool 'cause you're local
I don't care who you're friends with
I ain't scared of your bredrins
Ride out on man solo
Me one, I've got no phone
Do dirt and then go home
These freaks [?]
I don't need loads of love
I don't beat and open up
I just beat, bone and cut
You don't know me like that
So don't phone me like that
When I hang up, I phone him right back
And I don't know you from [?]

[Verse 3]
If man get shift and then snitch and talk all of my bizz with them
And I don't know where that nigga's at, I'll cut the chase and go get his friend
That's true life, no two sides
Man snitch and want new lives
I don't know what your crew's like
But over here there's no new guys

[?]
