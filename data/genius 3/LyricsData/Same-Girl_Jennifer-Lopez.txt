[Verse 1]
My head it's killing me
I'm losing sleep
And I'm waking up tired of it all
Early in the morning
And it's starting already
Why my name always involved?
I try to get rid of the baggage
Fake friends I call them "has-been"
Yeah they lying on stuff
And it's okay if they don't show me love (no)

[Pre-Chorus]
They want me to lock down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I'm never falling off

[Chorus]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me
Get off of me
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me
Get off of me
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me
Get off of me
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me
Get off of me
Cause in the end, I'm still the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
I'm just the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)

[Verse 2]
Tell me what I gotta do
I'm tryna make it clear to you
Not dealing with the attitude
I'm tired of tryna make you see that I'm still me
Switched up my longitude and latitude
You're in my way, you better move
Cause I'm on the same ground
No, I never changed, I'm
Loving everyday
I know that I'm the same Jenny from around the way

[Pre-Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
They want me to lock down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I'm never falling off

[Chorus: Jennifer Lopez]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me
Get off of me
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me
Get off of me
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me
Get off of me
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me
Get off of me
Cause in the end, I'm still the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
I'm just the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)

[Bridge]
Ima keep on growin'
Keep on shinin'
Just wanna do me
I had to thank God cause he chose me
I'm still the same

[Chorus]
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me
Get off of me
Too damn grown, I don’t owe nobody
Get off of me (Yea)
Get off of me (Yea)
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?
Get off of me
Get off of me
Too damn grown, I don’t owe nobody
Get off of me
Get off of me
Cause in the end I’m still the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
I’m just the same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
Same girl (same girl)
