I know that one day soon a song shall rise;
You'll hear it with the sleep still in your eyes
You'll waken to a brand new day
Can you hear bells ringin'
Voices singin'
Far away?

A time when every man will be as one
A time to reach right out and touch the sun
Come the day
Freedom's still a thought within your mind
The fleeting thing that some may never find
It may be still a million miles away
Can you hear bells ringin'
Voices singin'
Far away?

A time to live without doubt or fear
Welcome to the happy world that will be here
Come the day
The trumpets of war will cease to blow
The sound I hope that we may never know
We're waiting for the day
Can you hear bells ringin'
Voices singin'
Far away?

Lift up your voices and sing this song
Let the whole world hear it loud and strong
Can you hear bells ringin'
Voices singin'
Far away?
