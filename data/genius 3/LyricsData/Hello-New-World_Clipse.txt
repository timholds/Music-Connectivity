[Hook - Pharrell Williams]
Hello new world, here we come
On them Twinkie trains, with the hood screaming
We on our way
Can't forget where I come from
So I extend my hand to my man screaming
"I'm on my way!"
Yes I rap, but best believe
Them things still get wrapped by Papi screaming
"It's on its way!"
I can't wait for the next nigga
From my hood to say
Lookout world, I'm on my way

[Verse 1 - Pusha T]
I listen to the beat and the rhyme is wrote
See, I was 16, eyes full of hope
Bagging up grams at the Hyatt, doe
The news called it crack, I called it Diet Coke (Ohhh!)
At the same time, hiding from mama, dodging the drama
Fuckin plenty bitches while ducking the baby mama
I found poetry, excuse me, Floetry
"Say yes!" niggas hear the "eghck" and they know it's me
Make ‘em sick to their stomach how they s'posta be
Sippin on a 50 foot yacht, nigga, motion free
Ocean in my backyard where its s'posta be
Funny how my neighbors don't think its where I'm supposta be
They think I'm cuter in jail
But the only time I'm boxed in is when the roof's on the SL
And that even come off, so that would mean I'm visiting
New world, I hope y'all listening, envisioning

[Verse 2 - Malice]
This goes out to my A-alikes that hang out on them corners
Who rock Air Nike's, hustlers' way of life
In white T's, constantly, ducking from Ds
Pumpin that D arm, readily, waiting to squeeze
Who stay cookin, stay lookin, over they shoulders
Holdin them boulders, tryin to avoid central booking
I ain't coming at ‘cha quote, unquote "Famous Rapper"
Who turn positive, try to tell ya how to live
But this information I must pass to the homies
If hustling is a must be Sosa, not Tony
We can all shine; I want your wrist lit like mine
Neck and ears, I want it lit like mine
Foreign cars, stick shift, 6 gears like mine
Anything that keep mama from crying, visiting
You from behind that glass, while you away, sentencing
But the judge is saying "Life" like it ain't someone's life

[Interlude - Grimey]
Yo, what up, what up
This is ya man Grimey from downtown Norfolk
Just want y'all to know its about time for us to come up and make a change man
They keep tryin' to keep us down, but that ain't the way to be man
It's about time for us to get it together man
Ery'body else get they shit together
Why the niggas can't get they shit together, and get they money together
Hustlers come together with hustlers
Know what I'm sayin
This ain't just for the playas in VA
This for playas all over the world
This Grimey

[Verse 3 - Pusha T]
Times-a-wasting, niggas doin so much hatin
Free ya heart, and show ya greatness
I, like you, had to come from up under the basement
Just like you, had Satan tryin my patience
Still you look at me through jealous eyes
I wish to see all my niggas rise up!
Get that money, put them 9s up
Piggy-back out the ghetto ‘for times up!
Niggas rush!
