The development’s repellent sent means whack MC’s irrelevant
That’s packin me intelligent while lacking in embellishment
Bars blacking the cell im in while shackling the eloquent
But stopping me, man that's just like tackling an elephant
I spit fire so you could say im tacking an accelerant
In fact the tack attacks the racks of money that the teller sent
Because I won't Lie or dumb it down to increase my income
The Lord sent me so I am here to decease the sin son
I kick rhetoric instead of pick
To sever it, better wit to let it rip
You know that I Excel for it
Word for word the Power Points towards a Micro Soft touch
1 Corinthians 1:27 through 31 show only in my Lord I have much
I’m speaking truth and they saying that it can't be
But I’m going the distance skipping rocks to the West brook (Westbrook) just like Durant be
So in this game I’m pushing limits man ill admit it
But I can't be basic so I guess that I’m acidic

(Chorus)
Clayton: I got my rhyme and reason
And who I do this for
Benadiction: Hopefully you come to respect my choice
In 32 bars you come to respect my voice
Clayton: Your words will try and freeze them
But I just shut the door

2nd verse:
Couple cocky rhymes simply to prove myself
Being clever with this endeavor got me cleaning my shelf
But truthfully I got a story and an important message
My bars are the kind you can stand behind like you was arrested
So they may punish you, but they meant to keep you protected
So I'mma need you to listen close and get invested
Haters words cut deep, but I’m a barber so I get my fade with it
If the cool kids said the same thing as me you would be okay with it
If they get it a bit it would rid it of bigot-ry but then they'd really listen
I dip it in liquid I get from the spicket fresh flow is really rippin
Didn’t think I could skin this beat any other way but now its vulnerable
Cause what I want in life isn’t even earnable
I want to make it big but what that really matters
What matters is the one who picks my life up after is shatters
He made it beautiful put it in his house call it mosaic
An at the end of the day, ha I know i've made it

(Chorus)
