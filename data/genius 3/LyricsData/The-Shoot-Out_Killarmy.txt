{​​​​​​Movie Sample, Unknown man}​​​​​​

For some warriors, the answer is crystalised in an instant, their
Instincts point them only one way. The truth becomes undeniable, and
Apocylptic

[Dom Pachino, P.R. Terrorist]

I got a hunger for the mic my appetite strikes late at night
Food for thought, hold down the fort
Up in the port of riches last seen giving stitches
Grab a cat by his gold rope crucifix, his team actin superstitious
One eyein, one fakin, reachin for his iron
One tryin to get close, I got the toast
And I'm firin, blood gushin
I think I hear sirens, commotion
Still zonin off the war potion

[Beretta 9]

Yo wha, yo
We be the masters of circuference
My thought can't altered
Body, mind control substance
For the key to this shit, kid
Extermin' the imposter, a group of A-Alikes
My team be deep like a roster, we rob stuff
And break the legs of all imposters
Cut the tongues off of snakes
Just one hiss may cost ya, the price of ya life
I say always think twice, remember always think twice
Cause one fuckin mistake may be comin your wake, kid
So wake the fuck up, yo wake the fuck up, yo

[Islord]

Aiyoo, straight up and down
Dont even bring that type of shit around me
You liable to get ya whole neck slapped off ya shoulders
Quick fast, faster than the eye blink, so why think
You could live amongst the, livest mc's
And G-O-D's that I run with
And collaborate my thoughts with
To elevate to a higher standing as I landed
But never stranded as the God P.R. Terrorist apprehended
Analog suspects on the set


[Dom Pachino]
Dirty doctrine, killer concoction, rhyme rottin
Stay plottin, yesterday went grenade shoppin
Caught a nice one, grabbed the vest up
This track I blessed it, make it bloody, ugly
Dip it in mud, my soldiers gonna love me
Grab a mic, look into the sunshine way above me
Hold my forehead, today had my daily bread
Shared it with you, make sure my fans are always fed

[Killa Sin]

Yo I'm pullin wrestiln moves
On competition, headlocked into submission
While shots are lickin
Pickin through crops of intuition
Yo my brain starts to change shorts are strange (what)
Names brought in vain, court physical force of unexplained
For the battle of my life in the night light
This nigga grab a mic tight
And strike with a flash like dynamite, right
So figure this, Killa get vigorous
A lyricist supremicist attackin the track like native villages

Run, we still pillagin dunn
