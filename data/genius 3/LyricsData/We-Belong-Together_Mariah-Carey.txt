[Verse 1]
Sweet love yeah
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing I was stupid
I was foolish, I was lying to myself
I couldn’t have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
’Cause I didn’t know you, ’cause I didn’t know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt
The feeling that I’m feeling now that I don’t hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
‘Cause I don’t have a choice
Or what I wouldn’t give to have you lying by my side
Right here
’Cause baby

[Hook]
Baby, when you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who’s going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s going to take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together

[Verse 2]
I can't sleep at night, when you're on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Saying to me, "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute this is too deep (too deep)
I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial trying to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface
I only think of you
It's breaking my heart
I'm trying to keep it together but I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things crying trying to figure out
Where the hell I went wrong
Pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you need you back in my life baby

[Hook]
Baby, when you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
‘Cause we belong together
Who else am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who’s going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s going to take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together
Baby, when you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back baby please
‘Cause we belong together
Who am I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who’s going to talk to me on the phone 'til the sun comes up?
Who’s going to take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby, we belong together
