We belong together
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force

The hammer may strike
Be dead on the ground
A net to my hand
A cross on this crown

But we're done if we're undone
Finished if who we are incomplete
As one we are everything
We are everything we need

We belong together
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force
We've all been spoken for

What good is a life
With no one to share
The light of the moon
The honor of a swear

The kingdom of men
Is hollow within
Without depth
Without a care

That it takes to make a perfect love
The passion to find the utter truth
To visualize the straightened from the askew
To trade a common comfort for a view

Will you try to live the way in which you speak
Taste the milk of your mother earth's love
Spread the word of consciousness you seek
We are everything we need

We belong together
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force
We've all been spoken for
Spoken for
Spoken for

We belong together
Like the open seas and shores
Wedded by the planet force
We've all been spoken for

All this indecision
All this independent strain
Still, we've got our hearts on safe
We've got our hearts on safe

Someday when you're lonely
Sometime after all this bliss
Somewhere lost in emptiness
I hope you find this gift
I hope you find this gift
I hope you find this gift
