[Verse 2]
Gyal, it come in like say you have the whole place lock
Tightest shorts, and the something fat
Temperature burning hot
You fi give me the whole of the whine, don't hold it back
When you drop that thing to the ground
Something heavy, like 50 lb
I'm gonna wanna take you home
Can't leave you alone

[Chorus]
Gyal, me waan you shake wha' your mamma gi' you
Wha' you have on a fi you
Some gyal dem a watch you
Sit down and a chat you

Shake wha' your mamma gi' you
Wha' you have on a fi you
None of dem can flop your show
Just whine up your body gyal, whine go down low

[Hook]
Gyal!
Whine and show me, whine and show me
Fling it back, give me like a owe, you owe me
Whine and show me, whine and show me
Look how she a whine and she not even know me
Whine and show me, whine and show me
Tonight you a come, you nah go home lonely
Whine and show me, whine and show me
Whine. and. show. me. gyal
