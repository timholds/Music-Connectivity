[Verse 1]
The lies that you sell
They offend me
You’re the killer
And the kisser
Try to not tell
All my secrets
Stop the pressure
Hear the whisper
Watching myself fade away
How long will I live so broken?
A fallen friend, no family
How long will I keep failing?

[Chorus]
Can you tell that I’m hurt?
It’s critical
All I can smell is the burn
Of chemicals
And slowly lose to temptation
Let me go, let me fight
Chemicals in my mind

[Verse 2]
Regret as I fall
For that sweet burn
You’re the killer
And the kisser
Inject as I crawl
To my master
Stop the pressure
Hear the whisper
Watching myself fade away
How long will I live so broken?
A fallen friend, no family
How long will I keep failing?

[Chorus]
Can you tell that I’m hurt?
It’s critical
All I can smell is the burn
Of chemicals
And slowly lose to temptation
Let me go, let me fight
Chemicals in my mind

[Bridge]
Time, missed
I guess I’ve never contemplated
All the time that I have missed
Time, stress
I guess I’ve never contemplated
All the time wasted in stress
Time (time) missed (missed)
I guess I’ve never contemplated
All of it
Time (time) stress (stress)
I guess I’ve never contemplated
All of it

[Chorus]
Can you tell that I’m hurt?
It’s critical
All I can smell is the burn
Of chemicals
And slowly lose to temptation
Let me go, let me fight
Chemicals in my mind

[Outro]
I’m not a criminal
I hate the chemicals
I’m not a criminal
I hate the chemicals
I’m not a criminal
I hate the chemicals
I’m not a criminal
I hate the chemicals
