[Verse 1]
Hope you always think it's right
Hope you never worry, never even feel a-fright
Hope you always think it's right
When that ring is on the finger feeling tight, tight, tight

[PreChorus]
Listen to me, I tell you man, you must believe
Walking down the street, you see the tears and you must believe

[Chorus]
And you don't ever be down, I said don't ever
Never be down, I said don't ever

[Verse 2]
Hope you always think it's right
Hope you never worry, never even feel a-fright
Hope you always think it's right
When those little kicks inside you start to change your life

[PreChorus]
Listen to me, I tell you man, you must believe
They're gonna talk and talk, so I tell you man, you must believe

[Chorus]
And you don't ever be down, I said don't ever
Never be down, I said don't ever
Never be down, I said don't ever

[Outro]
(Never be down, I said don't ever)
Listen to me, I tell you man, you must believe
(Never be down, I said don't ever)
Listen to me, I tell you man, you must believe
(Never be down, I said don't ever)
Listen to me, I tell you man, you must believe
(Never be down, I said don't ever)
Listen to me, I tell you man, you must believe
(Never be down, I said don't ever)
Listen to me, I tell you man, you must believe
(Never be down, I said don't ever)
Listen to me, I tell you man, you must believe
