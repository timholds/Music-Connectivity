[Verse 1]
I'm rotting inside
My flesh turns to dust
Whisper: "Are you dying?", in my ear

I'm so sick to death
Tumors in my head
Whisper, are you dying in my ear?

[Chorus]
Black rose of death
In my fist I clutch
Thorns shred my finger tips
It drips toxic blood

[Verse 2]
Kiss me one last time
Wipe off my sweat
Whisper, are you dying in my ear?

As my bones, they rust
Read vows of trust
Whisper, are you dying in my ear?

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Verse 2]
