[Verse 1]
I'm not backin' down
I made it too far to say that the war is over now
Somehow I was neglectin' the fact that your heart is what you're protectin'
And that makes it special
Which is why I'm here
Standin' on this ledge, tryin' to make it clear

[Chorus]
I'm ready to fall for you
I've been waiting too long
I've gotta fight for us
And I know I'm right where I needed to be all along
So until I have your love, there's no surrender, no retreat
I'm never givin' up until I sweep you off your feet
I need your love (your love, your love, your love)

[Verse 2]
Yes I, let you down
I wasn't the man you wanted to fall for the first time around
Ammunition just wasn't sufficient
The bullets in my pistol kept missin'
Your heart, but I'm re-loaded
I just walked out and got you open

[Chorus]
I'm ready to fall for you
I've been waiting too long
I've gotta fight for us
And I know I'm right where I needed to be all along
So until I have your love, there's no surrender, no retreat
I'm never givin' up until I sweep you off your feet
I need your love (your love, your love, your love)

[Outro]
Oooh, I need your love (your love, your love, your love)
I need your love (your love, your love, your love)
Girl, I need your love (your love, your love, your love)
