I can't deal with the future, so stuck in the past
I can't deal with the present, never seems to last
No, I can't find the patience, to weather the storm
I can't find the answer, I'm not even warm

One day at a time, one hell of a ride
All I know, I'm still alive
So I'll take it, one day at a time

Nothing comes easy, when you're looking too hard
I find so much is missing, it's tearing me apart
Take away all the sadness, cover the black
Take a walk with the madness, never come back

One day at a time, one hell of a ride
All I know, I'm still alive
So I take it, one day at a time

If I think too far down the road, I won't make it through the night
Deep down inside, I know, at the end there's a light
So I'll just keep holding on

One day at a time, it's one hell of a climb
All I know, it hasn't killed me yet
One day at a time, one hell of a ride
All I know, I'm still alive
So I'll take it, one day at time

One day at a time
