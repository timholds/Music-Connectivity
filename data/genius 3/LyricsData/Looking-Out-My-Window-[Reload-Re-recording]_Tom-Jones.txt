Now people you know who I am and you what I can do
But I got a problem now and I'm gonna tell you about it
I'm looking for this woman you see
Listen, this is the way the story goes

Looking out my window, looking at the rain
Nothing left but sorrow, nothing left but pain
Why did you go and leave me, set me alone and blue
Looking out my window, woman, trying to find you

Why did you leave me?
Why did you grieve me?

Looking out my window, what do I see
Nobody's crying, everything's bad in me
I don't think that they feel, so alone and blue
Looking out my window baby, trying to find you

Why did you leave me?
Why did you grieve me?
Oh, uh, ah, oooo

I'd like to tell you about this little girl
That left us so alone and blue
The trouble is, if I paint the picture too well
You might fall in love with her too

She was about 5' 6
And a little bag of tricks
My mama told me to watch myself, but I didn't listen
Because, when you baby, I'd stretch out my arms

Looking out my window, not a railroad track
Waiting for that little brown eyed girl, she's coming back
I gotta hear the wind blowing, down the line
Come on back girl, to be mine all mine

Why did you leave me?
Why did you grieve me?

Woah, baby come on home
I'm so alone
You know and I don't care what the world might say
I'm gonna love you anyway

Oh baby, I do all I need, I'm begging you please, oh
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby

I love you, I love you come on home
Come on home, baby
Come on home, baby
Come on home, baby, to me
