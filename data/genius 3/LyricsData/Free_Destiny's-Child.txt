[Verse 1: Beyoncé]
Wait a minute , wait a minute
I think I gotta take some time and clear my mind
Cause if I don't I might (scream)
Scream out loud
In a little bit, I'ma tell you what I'm talking 'bout
Ladies, (ladies, ladies)
If you know what I mean
When you're in love you give your everything
Tired of nothing happening
Oh, this time is for me
Nigga you been doing you I'm gon' do me
Ladies help me sing it

[Pre-Chorus: All]
You steady telling lies
I stayed and pacified
While I kept denying the truth
You're always here and there
Finally I don't care
I'ma keep it real with you

[Chorus]
Ain't no feeling like being free
When your mind's made up
And your heart's in the right place
Ain't no feeling like being free
When you've done all you could
But what's misunderstood
It's all good, it's all good
Ain't no feeling like being free
I'm like an eagle set free
And finally I'm looking out for me
Ain't no feeling like being free
Cause my mind's up
And my heart is in the right place

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Hold'em up, wait a second
I gotta get something of my chest
My happiness was your happiness
I lived and (breathed)
You and all your needs
Let me speak
It's best I do what's best for me
Now ladies, (ladies, ladies)
I've got my mind back
I've been there and done that
No looking back, no
Ooh this time is for me
Nigga you been doing you I'm gon' do me
I'm free

[Pre-Chorus: All]
Time is of the essence
And it's much too short
To waste another minute on you
While you steady tryna hide
I'm packing, saying bye
I thought you were my dream come true

[Chorus]
Ain't no feeling like being free
When your mind's made up
And your heart's in the right place
Ain't no feeling like being free
When you've done all you could
But what's misunderstood
It's all good, it's all good
Ain't no feeling like being free
I'm like an eagle set free
And finally I'm looking out for me
Ain't no feeling like being free
Cause my mind's up
And my heart is in the right place

[Bridge 1: Kelly]
No, it ain't easy being left out (no)
Or being forgotten about (being forgotten about)
You didn't deserve my love (my love)
I've had enough, set me (free)

[Chorus]
Ain't no feeling like being free
When your mind's made up
And your heart's in the right place
Ain't no feeling like being free
When you've done all you could
But what's misunderstood
It's all good, it's all good
Ain't no feeling like being free
I'm like an eagle set free
And finally I'm looking out for me
Ain't no feeling like being free
Cause my mind's up
And my heart is in the right place

[Bridge 2: Michelle]
Can I get some loving? (mmm)
Can I get some time? (mmm)
Loving in the morning(yeah)
And in the midnight hour (baby, baby)
I gave you everything you (wanted)
I gave you everything you (needed)
But you just didn't do right (mmm)
So baby I'm leaving(no, no)
It feels so good to be free

[Chorus]
Ain't no feeling like being free
When your mind's made up
And your heart's in the right place
Ain't no feeling like being free
When you've done all you could
But what's misunderstood
It's all good, it's all good
Ain't no feeling like being free
I'm like an eagle set free
And finally I'm looking out for me
Ain't no feeling like being free
Cause my mind's up
And my heart is in the right place

[Outro]
Yeah, I don't wanna hear it
No, no, no, no, get up out of here
I don't wanna hear it
No, no, no, no, get up out of here
