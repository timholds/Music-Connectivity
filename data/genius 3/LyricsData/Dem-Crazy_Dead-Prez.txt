[Intro]
[stic.man]
The police is the enemy

[Hook One – stic.man]
Everywhere the white man go, he bring misery
All throughout history—look it up
Everything them bald heads touch, they fuck it up
Every government he set up, it be corrupt

[Stephen Marley]
Revolution

[Verse 1 – stic.man]
What you know is who you are—who are you?
Do you know who you are in the world?  What is your world view?
What do you go through?  What has your life shown you?
What are you learnin’ in this so called life?
Do you have principle or do you blow with the wind?
Do you wanna be free but don't know where to begin?
Do you know your enemy from your friend?
Even your kin is deeper than skin—it’s the system they keepin’ us in
Will we survive?  Do you believe?  Are we afraid?
Would you rather have control of your life or be a slave?
Show me a sign.  A pig ain't no homey of mine
They own me what's mine—I'll show you if you loan me your nine
I'm only concerned for tables to turn
When the people learn the truth about the system, the cities will burn
And I stand firm, like Shaka Zulu
These crackers can't stop uhuru

[Hook Two – Stephen Marley]
Dem crazy, Dem crazy
Dem crazy, Dem crazy
Chase those crazy bald heads right out of town

[Verse 2 – M-1]
This is what we be waitin’ for?  21st century, still poor
World war, they want me to kill for
What happened to the future they always predicted?
With new science fictional things and space visits
I've seen two sides—us against them
Police troops ride with four to five men
Prison businesses boomin’, senators grin
People searchin’ for answers.  Where to begin?
Capitalism born from the backs of blacks
White folks relax, live off the kick backs
Gettin’ worked to the bone, yo, build this country
Further exploited by class to make money
Filthy rich capitalist with blood loot
Use main frames systems to bank and compute
With the next technology, credit through the wires
Internet growth demand more suppliers
Welfare, elderly checks, and wage workers
All us, elephants trapped in they circus
Ain't fightin’ over manmade chips no more
When the lights go out, it's gon’ belong to the poor

[Hook Two – Stephen Marley]
Dem crazy, Dem crazy
Dem crazy, Dem crazy
Chase those crazy bald heads right out of town

[stic.man]
Everything you got is what you took from me
Conditions on my block, just like we in slavery
Everything you got is what you took from me
Conditions on my block, just like we in slavery

[Stephen Marley]
(*Ad-Libs*)
I'm feelin’, oh, what I feel

[Hook One – stic.man]
Everywhere the white man go, he bring misery
All throughout history—you can look it up
Everything them bald heads touch, they fuck it up
Every government he set up, it be corrupt

[stic.man]
Where the soldiers at?
Where the warriors at?
Where the riders at?
Where them fighters at?
Where the soldiers at?
Where the warriors at?
Where the riders at?
Freedom fighters at?

[Stephen Marley]
Soon we’ll find out who is the real revolutionary
True soldiers don't die.  Long live all legends: Nat Turner, Malcolm X…
