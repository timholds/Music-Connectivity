In the night... Hiding all my weaknesses
In the night... distorting all my consciousness
I won't come back tomorrow
I won't return again
I won't come back tomorrow
I won't return again
Return again...
In the night... discovering the places I can hide
In the night... letting out the animal inside
I won't come back tomorrow
I won't return again
I won't come back tomorrow
I won't return again
Return again...
In the night... I won't come back tomorrow
In the night... I won't return again
Return again...
