I just came back from a lovely trip
Along the Milky Way
I stopped off at the North Pole
To spend a holiday
I called on dear old Santa Claus
To see what I could see
He took me to his big workshop
And told his plans to me, so
You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He's making a list
And checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is comin' to town
He sees you when you're sleepin'
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake
You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
With little tin horns and little toy drums
Rooty-toot-toots and rummy-tum-tums
Santa Claus is comin' to town
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo
Elephants, boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is comin' to town
The kids in girl and boyland
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a Toyland town
All around the Christmas tree, so
You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout, I'm tellin' you why
Santa Claus is comin' to town
