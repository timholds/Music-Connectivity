[Verse]
Virginia was a "lot lizard" from F.L.A
She had a compound fracture in the "trunk"
It started when she ran away
Thumbs out on the interstate
She hitched a ride to misery

"Mr. Whirly" had a catastrophic incident
He fell into the city by the bay
He liquidated his estate
Now he sleeps upon the Haight
Panhandling misery

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's gonna get high, high, high
When he's low, low, low

[Chorus]
The fire burns from better days
And she screams "why, oh, why?"
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of misery

[Verse]
Well, Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam
He ran the drug cartel in "Tinseltown"
They found him in a Cadillac
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat in the name
Of misery

Then Gina hit the road to New York City
Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked
She stopped in Vegas to elope
With Virginia and the dope
That kissed the bride eternally

[Pre-Chorus]
And they're gonna get high, high, high
When they're low, low, low

[Chorus]
The fire burns from better days
And she screams "why, oh, why?"
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of misery

[Verse]
Well, hell hounds on your trail now once again, boy
It's groping on your leg until it sleeps
The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow
Cause it's not what you make, it's what you leave

[Pre-Chorus]
And we're gonna get high, high, high
When we're low, low, low

[Chorus]
The fire burns from better days
And she screams "why, oh, why?"
I said I don't know
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday
Of misery
