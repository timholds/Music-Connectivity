State of the nation
A room you never use
See yourself in power
That sweet sick enemy
Home is where there's danger
Send it to your friend
State of the nation
A room you never use

Life begins when you're ready to face it
I've changed my mind because I'm stuck on
The state of the nation

I know you've got potential
So what's your price, I'll pay it
Consumer guide to help you
And a cheque card just to let some (fun)
It's time I had a wash out
Cold storage, no more head room
Collecting things I don't need
In a room I never use

Life begins when you're ready to face it
I've changed my mind because I'm stuck on
The state of the nation
