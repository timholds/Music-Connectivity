Bakelite as black as night it's like a friend
Maybe you need a mocking bird to kill me in the end
Story lines is someone tired cold curry breakfast again
The dealer's to thank for another wank hand you need a friend
And all you have all you have it worries me
And what you said what you said it worries me
That new hat that you had has got me afraid
You're all mad you're all fat
It means the world to me the world to me
It means the world to me
An over zealous tour guide that has to hide
Every time I hear that ice-cream van it's pissing down outside
You're weirder than the after-life you need a friend
And your fashion sense is no recompense pardon my French
And all you have all you have it worries me
And what you said what you said it worries me
That new hat that you had has got me afraid
You're all mad you're all fat
It means the world to me
It means the world to me
It means the world to me
And all you have all you have it worries me
And what you said what you said it worries me
That new hat that you had has got me afraid
You're all mad you're all fat
It means the world to me
And all you have all you have it worries me
What you said what you said it worries me
That new hat that you had has got me afraid
