Going down a path other people chose for me
Being undersold by the same people close to me
One day imam blow; hopefully and become a great notably
These bitches startin to notice me
Blow em apart is what my motive be
My life is my art it’s the only thing that’s holding me
Life’s a bitch; hit her in the ovaries, with lyrics like this
Is why you’re not bored of me


Keep on ignorn me'
And ill go to where you’re snoring sleep
Put a fist in your door at least, but
Keep on supportin me
And I’ll give you dope beats accordingly
I got plenty more in store you’ll see
Just look forward as I proceed
To give you whatchu need
Chill vibes, catch a few P’s
On me for free

Ozzoui’s in the seat
As I speak, put it in my mouth
Bust a free, killin all theses fucks for free
Bitches getting stuck to me
They goin nuts as they scream
I’m bustin nuts as they cream
What the Fuck it’s a Dream; Is how I describe my life it seems
I’m blowin Up Like nitrocine. Got dirt on my shoulder, so I
Whipe it clean
Can't hate when lifes a dream
Only at the mic I scream
Talkin about the haters in the tightest jeans
Who would never give a chance to the likes of me
But don’t throw me away cuz I might succeed


Like Dwayne Wade and Just swallow the Heat
Their ain't a problem with me, this ain't twitter
Butcha followin me? Next one to blow
You know It’s probably me; Obviously
I’m outta they league hey
You live for the weekend
I live for every weekday and
Every girl I see is like speed date
Crowds of people willing to do what we say
They respect us and accept us in their home place
And we thank them as we take our own stage
And try to make history in our own way

Hey! Everyday is the best day ever
Let it stay this way forever
Stress free-blaze
And we stay together

We follow the recipe
To Live off tour hype
Grabbing some weed and a Coors light
I already got Two strikes
But fck it it’s a loose a night
Pour me a cup, its some goose right?

I just wanna live my life
Be happy every single night
So I focus in and write; despite
It getting lonely in the single life

But I do it because I love my craft
It gets me higher than any drug I’ve ever had
Music brings out my better half
If you wanna attack
A skill like this is whatchu betta have

The difference between me and them
Is the same magic as dre & em
We needed a hand n it was lent
Its Harv, Jay, and friends kid
Have to mention those who attended
We built something special
We built this friendship
If you like it give it a mention
Everyone thanks for the love
And attention…
