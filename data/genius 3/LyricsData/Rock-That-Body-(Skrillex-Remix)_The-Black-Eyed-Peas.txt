[Crazy electro ends]

Let me see your body rock
Shakin' it from the bottom-to-top
Freak to what the DJ drop
We be the ones to make it hot (to make it hot)
Electric shock, energy like a billion watts
Space be boomin', the speakers pop
Galactic combin' missed a spot
We bumpin' in your parking lot

When you're comin' up in the spot
Don't bring nothin' we call Pink Dot
'Cause we burnin' around the clock
Hit the lights and then turn them off
If you bring, that don't make you stop
Like the jungle, we run the block
No one rollin' the way we rock - way we rock
Rock-Rock

Superfly ladies
Alla my superfly ladies
Alla my superfly ladies
Alla my super fl - superfly ladies

Yeah, you could be big bone, long as you feel like your own
You could be the model type, skinny with no appetite
Short, stacked, black or white
Long as you do what you like
Body outta sight
Body outta sight (Body body outta sight)

I wanna da...I wanna dance in the lights
I wanna ro...I wanna rock 'yo body
I wanna go...I wanna go for a ride
Hop in the music and rock your body right

Rock that body, come on come on, rock that body (Rock your body)
Rock that body, come on come on, rock that body
Rock that body, come on come on, rock that body (Rock your body)
Rock that body, come on come on, rock that body

Rock your body

Rock that

Rock that, rock that, rock that body

Rock that

Rock that body (Ooooohhhh)
Rock that
Let me see the

Rock that
Body
Rock that, rock that, rock that body

Rock that
Body
(Oooohhh)
Rock that
Rock that body, come on come on, rock that-that-that-that-that

She does the Two-Step
And the Tongue Drop
She does the Cabbage Patch
And the Bus Stop

She like electro (electro), she love hip-hop (hip-hop)
She like the reggae
She feel punk rock
She wear samba and the mambo
She like to break dance and calypso
Getta little crazy
Getta little stupid
Getta little crazy-crazy-crazy

I wanna da...I wanna dance in the lights
I wanna ro...I wanna rock 'yo body
I wanna go...I wanna go for a ride
Hop in the music and rock your body right
