Taking him out was the best shot of turning around the sorry end
We got beat again we decide instead that the past is past
Can't turn back into rain get away get away get
Was that in the head was in the coat all summer long?

Anticipation is just there and then it's gone
Night and day, we go out just to look like sad
Young men on a train and I'm remembering
When we got beat down again, we got beat down again

But something expends I'm gonna keep all of my friends
Anticipation's gonna come up with it's own ends
What's that in the head was it the coat all summer long?
Anticipation it's just there and then it's gone

What's that in the head was it the coke all summer long?
Anticipation it's just there and then it's gone
It's gone, it's gone, oh, no, it's gone
