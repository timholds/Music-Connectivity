Ooh, there's something sexy
About the way that dress is wearing you tonight
You've got my attention, girl, I'm hard as steel
Cuz you're looking right
Your hair, your nails, your toes
Girl you've got me knocking at your door
Ain't no secret you know that I'm here for your body

Repeat 1

Girl I'd be lying
If I said you weren't turning me on
The way you work it girl
I wish it could last all night long
Cuz you got it going on
Look what you done started
Girl you know I want it

2 - If you want it, you got it
Come get it from me
I've got what you want
If you want my body
Just try it, you'll like it
Come on boy and see
It's my body... my body

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Repeat 2

(Lil' Bo Peep)
Who be the Wicked Fly
Ass with the sex appeal
Tightly emerged as I swerve brothas
Be trying to cop feels
Low hills as I be posten up
Flossin' my shhh
GoGo stunters trying to run a
Road flip on my kits
All in my splits movin' the hips
Got them wide open
Hopin' they the puff in the blunts
Keep smokin'
I'm knowing that my naughty classy
Like that
Skin tight light bright
And you're the daddy Mac
No smack of mines over split
See the milk don't lie
It does a body good
Good make you say my, my
But you've been peepin' since the last
Weekend so why now
Infatauated by my steelo the way I get down
Now is the time if you want better
Get up on it
Curves so superb bottle glass exponent
I'm wanting it like the Gulfas Troopas
Pooper Scooper
Army fatigues trying to dig up in
My Cuba give me

Repeat 1
Repeat 1 and 2 until fade
