[Hook: Jennifer Lopez]
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
No matter where I go, I know where I came from
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
No matter where I go, I know where I came from

[Chorus: J.Lo & {TLC}]
I'm still, I'm still, {Hanging out the passenger side of}
Jenny from the block
{His best friend's ride} I know where I came from
{Trying to holler at me}
{I don't want no scrub}
I'm still, {Hanging out the passenger side of}
Jenny from the block
{His best friend's ride} I know where I came from
{Trying to holler at me}

[Bridge: TLC]
I don't want your number (no)
I don't want to give you mine and (no)
I don't want to meet you nowhere (no)
I don't want none of your time and (no)

[Hook]
Trying to holler at me

[Chorus]

[Verse 1: TLC]
But a scrub is checkin' me. but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
Cuz I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' no deadbeat ass; So (no)

[Bridge]

[J.Lo]
I stayed grounded as the amounts roll in
Nothing phony, don't hate on me

I'm still, I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
No matter where I go, I know where I came from
No matter where I go, I know where I came from
No matter where I go, I know where I came from
I'm still Jenny from the block

[Chorus]

[TLC]
If you don't have a car and you're walking
Oh yes son I'm talking to you
If you live at home wit' your momma
Oh yes son I'm talking to you (baby)
If you have a shorty but you don't show love
Oh yes son I'm talking to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no I don't want no (oh)

[Chorus 2x]

I like the way you move.....

[Hook]

[Chorus]

I'm still, I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
I'm still, I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block

I'm still, I'm still, Hanging out the passenger side
Of Jenny from the block
His best friend's ride I know where I came from
Trying to holler at me
