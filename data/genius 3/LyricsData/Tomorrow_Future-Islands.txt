We've known each other for a long time
Though you had me from the first
I told you all of my secrets
I wish I had them back now

But what's a man to do
When a man can't be true?

I can't call you up anymore
Just like to know you, have you around
I can't build you up anymore
Cause' when I do, you let me down

[Chorus]
And maybe she'll call
And maybe she won't
I'm sorry, I'm saying sorry
Every time we talk

I just want you around
Baby, you stole my heart
I need it back, now
I need it back, now

But what's a man to do
If a man can't be true
You tell me, what's a man to do?
Try and get it back now

[Chorus]
And maybe she'll call
And maybe she won't
I'm sorry, I'm saying sorry
Every time we talk

Hey young lovely
I just want you around
Baby you stole my heart
I need it back now
I need it back now...
