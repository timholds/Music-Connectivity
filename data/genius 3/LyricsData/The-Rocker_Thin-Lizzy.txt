I am your main man
If you're looking for trouble
I'll take no lip
No-one's tougher than me

I kicked your face
You'd soon be seeing double
Hey little girl, keep your hands off of me
I'm a rocker

I'm a rocker
I'm a roller too, baby
I'm a rocker

Down at the juke joint me and the boys were stomping
Blipping and bopping and telling a dirty joke or two
In walked this chick
And I knew she was up for something
And I kissed her right there out of the blue
I said "Hey baby, meet me, I'm a tough guy
Got my cycle outside, you wanna try?"
She just looked at me and rolled them big eyes and said
I'd do anything for you, cause you're a rocker

That's right
I'm a rocker
I'm a roller too, honey
I'm a rocker

I love to rock and roll
I get my records at the Rock On stall
Rock and roll
Teddy boy, you got them all

Rocker
I love to rock and roll
I get my records at the Rock On stall
Sweet rock and roll
Teddy boy, you got them all

I'm a rocker
