Get so caught up everyday
Trying to keep it all together
While the time just slips away
See I know nothing lasts forever

Imagine there was no tomorrow
Imagine that I couldn't see your face
There'd be no limit to my sorrow
So all I can say

I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cuz it would all mean nothing if I don't say something
Before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour, let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something
Won't wait 'til it's too late

I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
I won't wait 'til it's too late

Just a simple conversation (...sation)
Just a moment is all it takes (Yeah)
I wanna be there just to listen (I wanna be here)
And I don't wanna hesitate (Oh no)

Imagine there was no tomorrow (Imagine)
Imagine that I couldn't see your face (Your face)
There'd be no limit to my sorrow (Oh no)
'Cuz there is nothing that can fill this space

I don't wanna put it off for too long
I didn't say all that I had to say
I wanna take the time to right the wrongs
Before we get to that place, ooh

I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cuz it would all mean nothing if I don't say something
Before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour, let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something
Won't wait til it's too late

Just lean on my shoulder
It's not over 'til it's over
Don't worry 'bout it
'Cuz I'm gonna make sure
Our bond gets stronger, yeah

I don't wanna wait until the storm
There's something wrong
And now you're gone
And I can't find ya

I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cuz it would all mean nothing if I don't say something
Before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour, let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something
Won't wait til it's too late

I wanna tell you something, give you something
Show you in so many ways
'Cuz it would all mean nothing if I don't say something
Before it all goes away
Don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
Waste another hour, let alone another day
I'm gonna tell you something, show you something
Won't wait 'til it's too late

I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
(I won't wait 'til it's too late)
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
(No, won't wait, no no)
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
(I won't wait 'til it's too late)
I can't wait, I can't wait, I won't wait, I don't wanna wait
(No, no, no, no, no)

No, no, no
I can't wait, I won't wait
No, no
I can't wait, I won't wait
