Well am I feeling something wrong?
And are you waiting for a change
You wanna know it; I refuse to tell you
We've seen this happen over and over again
Thinking that a little time might solve a problem
I look at you and I’m your silent friend
So what are you smiling for?
What are you smiling for?
So am I a foolish little boy
Or have I been drinking too much wine
Now we’re t-t-t-t-t-talking to each other, I wanna give
You compliments but I can’t find the words
So now we’re here, laughing at each other
I look at you and I’m your silent friend
So what are you smiling for?
What are you smiling for?
What are you smi-i-i-ling for?
~
So what are you smiling for?
What are you smiling for?
What are you smi-i-ling for?
What are you smiling for?
What are you smi-i-i-ling for?
