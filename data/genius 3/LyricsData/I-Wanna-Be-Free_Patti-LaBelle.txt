I've been here too long feeling sorry for myself
I've been too upset to make the first step
But now I see the light at rainbow's end
Finally, I found my peace within

I want to be free
Every minute of my life
I wanna be the best that I can be
I want to be free
In the days that lie ahead
I'm gonna see all there is to see

I'm coming out of this, another day is too long
There's a life out there that my name is on
Thank you, father, for this serenity
In blessings I'm rich, because you walked with me

Oh, I want to be free
Every minute of my life
I wanna be the best that I can be
Oh, I want to be free
(In the days that lie ahead) oh, yes
(I'm gonna see)

There's nothing to stop me
No one can block me
I'm going all the way, yeah
Don't want you to hold me
You can't control me, 'cause I, I

I, I want (I want to be free) I want to be free, yes
(In the time that I have left)
I'll spread my wings
I'll fly away
That's where I need to be
(I want to be free)
Away from you
Oh yes, I am
(In the days and nights I have left)
(All that I can be)

(I want to be free)
I want to be free, yes
(In the time that I have left)
I don't want to mess around
I don't want to lose my time
I don't want you no more
(I want to be free)
(In the days that I have left)
I'm telling you I want to leave you
(I wanna be free)
That's what I'm gonna do
I don't need ya
(I wanna be free)
Baby boy, go your way
And I'll go mine
(I wanna be free)
I want to be
Need to be free
(I wanna be free)
Said I wanna be free
(I wanna be free)
