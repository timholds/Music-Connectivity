[Intro]

[Hook]
Dark days ahead man, nothing is decided
I try to convalesce, this sickness that's inside me
But nothing works man the illness is presiding
And the dark days ahead man, they are not subsiding

[Verse 1]
And I am riding a wild horse to pasture
I try to break it man but it starts to move faster
A manufactured strike and the chapter starts to fracture
I am not the master, just captured by disaster
And after my mind starts to motherfuckin' clear
I realize that I ain't even been here
Far away in a land between dreams and death
Another shot to the veins cause there's nothin' left
And it all begins to coalesce
And I start to dig myself deeper as I confess
And I'm putting myself at a distance
All at the insistence of the motherfuckin' persistence

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Grindin', finding, got a fix finally
I think I did too much man my lungs stuck violently
Or maybe it's the total fuckin' opposite of that
Fade away slow like I'm drowning on the track
In fact, I'm back, fuck the haters royally
Think ya'll tough shit, you's a fuckin' toy to me
Plastic, fake, cheap, yeah, and easily broken
Shut ya god damned mouth, Venom has spoken
Awoken, from sleep, and now the beast speaks
Half ya'll shit talkers ain't best my technique
And you think that your fuckin' opinion matters?
Fuck it, I'll leave ya motherfuckin' perceptions shattered
