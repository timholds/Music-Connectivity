[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
The face that I see it's the woman in me
It's the woman that I want to be
The face that I see it's the woman in me
It's the woman in me I see (I see)

[Verse]
As I look in look in the mirror I see
Life is really here to be with me oh
I can see myself getting stronger everyday
I'm not the same woman I used to be
So now I tell myself I am thinkin strong
I see the beauty lying within my soul

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
The face that I see it's the woman in me
It's the woman that I want to be
The face that I see it's the woman in me
It's the woman in me I see (I see)

[Verse]
When I love myself I can do whatever I want
Doesn't matter what you do to me, do to me
Honest people, there's a possibility
To tell you my real reality

[Chorus: Destiny's Child]
The face that I see it's the woman in me
It's the woman that I want to be
The face that I see it's the woman in me
It's the woman in me I see (I see)

Can you see the woman in me
Do you really want to see the woman in me
Ha ha, let me show you

[Verse: Destiny's Child/Beyonc√©]
Don't underestimate the woman I become
The woman I am
So now I tell myself that I'm thinkin I'm strong
And I see the beauty lying within my soul

[Chorus: Destiny's Child (repeat until fade)]
The face that I see it's the woman in me
It's the woman that I want to be
The face that I see it's the woman in me
