[Strophe 1]
I still whisper you name
My nightly dreams are still the same

[Chorus]
I am Numb, I lost my mind
I am bound, I am entwined
Unlearned to seek, inapt to find
It comes and shoots me from behind
The eyes of love are blind

[Strophe 2]
I still repeat it on and on
Until the last echo is gone

[Chorus]

[Strophe 3]
I still whisper your name - again
My nightly dreams are still the same -
Again and again and again

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Obtaining wisdom leads to grief
Still pictures spinning on repeat
I need a leash I can't unwind
The eyes of love are blind

Tomorrow will be fine
I leave it all behind

[Chorus]
I am Numb, I lost my mind
I am bound, I am entwined
Unlearned to seek, inapt to find
I come and shoot you from behind
The eyes of love are blind
