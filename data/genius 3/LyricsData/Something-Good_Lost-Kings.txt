[Verse 1]
Know I want it more than ever
And now I got you on the tip of my tongue
All you got through the windows
Like a breeze that I've been waiting so long

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel something good holding on to me
You took me so high, below me I don't see

[Chorus]
You got me begging you for more, more, baby
Come on now, don't be shy
Don't hold it back tonight
More, more, baby
Come on now, don't be shy
Don't hold it back tonight

[Post-Chorus]
Don't hold it back tonight, don't hold it back tonight
Don't hold it back tonight, don't hold it back tonight

[Verse 2]
Don't know what happened to the old me
But I couldn't give a damn what I'm on
Can't stop dancing, don't try to tell me
But this new shit got me rocking so strong

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel something good holding on to me
You took me so high, below me I don't see

[Chorus]
You got me begging you for more, more, baby
Come on now, don't be shy
Don't hold it back tonight
More, more, baby
Come on now, don't be shy
Don't hold it back tonight

[Bridge]
Lucky for me, got no tricks up your sleeve
Just that re-lifted pickup, that smooth as no hiccups
That gifted release spread through the streets
You know what I mean

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel something good holding on to me
You took me so high, below me I don't see

[Chorus]
You got me begging you for more, more, baby
Come on now, don't be shy
Don't hold it back tonight
More, more, baby
Come on now, don't be shy
Don't hold it back tonight
