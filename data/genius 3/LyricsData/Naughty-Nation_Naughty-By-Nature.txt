[Intro: Treach]
Naughty bring back that feelin' bring back that (x4)

[Verse 1: Treach]
It's the rap master, last passer, the ass smacker
Your ass backwards, we call you bassackwards
Rappers flasher, cash stacker, slash actor
Passport pimpin', you can call me the last atlas
You can't know me, can't hold me, chicks a champ homie
After she dance, I lift her like a tramp trophy
The shit, but on the track flies, I'm that fly
Try me, I capsize your hat's cap size
The mad supported, back supported, get your track deported
Platinum streets from every platinum track recorded
Got the lotto model, pay me if you swallow, follow
I'm your leader beater, that make them swallow hollows
'bout this, 'bout that, I'm 'bout straps
If you a rapper, how's that for a mouse trap?
Get the handsome ransoms, keep them dancing
Act like you know naughty got mansions from these damn anthems

[Hook x2]
(Feel) the naughty nation
Come on, get it, got it, we back, boy
Once again it's on in your ass, boy
We keep them naughty shorties poppin' ass boy, that's what you lack boy

[Verse 2: Treach]
Naughty, oh shit, your pussy, I see your ball prints
Thank for the scores, we balling along his office
Pitter patter, digger dagger, with a bigger swagger
Piss each other off, see who got the biggest bladder
The biggest rappers from Jers since the business shattered
Wicked niggas, true gangstas, and the wisdom hatters
Ferrari stripper, every part of me ripped up
Smoke a marley with liquor, quicker artery ripper
We do things, niggas who bang on that zoo thang
New slang, a true gang puffin' the pootang
? style, yeah, child ?
But I bang on your forehead and I ain't talking hairstyles
New click cobras, them niggas spitting venom
Spitting saliva, we harmonize an awkward opera
True hip hoppers, serve ya with liquid lava
You're not a nigga, now come on, get it, we gotcha

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Treach]
I'm ? mash his ass with graphic atlas
So many these rapping bastards hip hop culture clashes
Come on, get it, critic, known for flippin' wicked widdit
Here's my ass, you can come and get it, kiss it, get it
We made your grave, twelve ? parade
I'll blow up the spot looking sharp like a suede grenade
Got a nasty flow, watch platinum glow
Fort Knox got locks harder picked than a nappy 'fro
I admire the trier that try to rattle the riot
Anthem's acquired so you can go fire the choir
Half a ass, blast an asshole
Tussle and tackle the trunk, they call it couple Capo's
Naughty bring back that feelin' bring back that
Naughty bring back that feelin' bring back that

[Hook x4]
