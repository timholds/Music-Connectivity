Down at Your feet, O Lord is the most high place
In Your presence Lord, I seek Your face, I seek Your face
For down at Your feet, O Lord is the most high place
In Your presence Lord, we seek Your face, we seek Your face

There is no higher calling, no greater honor than to bow
And kneel before Your throne
I'm amazed at Your glory, embraced by Your mercy, Oh
Lord, I live to worship You
