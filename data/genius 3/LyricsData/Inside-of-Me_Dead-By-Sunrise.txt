I feel my time is slipping away
(Every minute gone by seems like a day)
I'll never get back the things I lost along the way

What the hell is wrong with me?
This isn't who I'm supposed to be

(Woooh) I feel all alone everyday
(Woooh) And just so far away
(Woooh) I know something's got to change
(Woooh) Inside of me!

What is it that I'm running from?
(My head is like a loading gun)
Every thought is trapped inside this web I've spun

What the hell is wrong with me?
This isn't who I'm supposed to be!

(Woooh) I feel all alone everyday
(Woooh) And just so far away
(Woooh) I know something's got to change
(Woooh) Inside of me!


(Woooh) I feel all alone everyday
(Woooh) And just so far away
(Woooh) I know something's got to change
(Woooh) Inside of me!

Me!!
