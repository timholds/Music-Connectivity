[Intro]
[Jay Boogie]
Two J's on a track, now that's what the fuck I'm talkin bout...

[Verse 1: J. Venom]
Man fuck you to all these little snitches
And middle fingers up to the haters, mind ya own business
Ya'll talk alot of shit, spittin' for the pigs
And I spit alot a shit, tryin' to make it big bitch
Ya'll ain't on me, ima' motherfuckin' winner
And I eat wackass rappers like ya'll for dinner
My rhymes blast so fast ya never know what hit ya
Best get on up then out my motherfuckin' kitchen
Ima' fiend? So the fuck what?
Pass the rig here an I'll show ya what the fuck is up
Pull, push, tap-tap, yeah we bangin' up
Fuckin' hooked bro, but I love this rap stuff
Black, brown, tan, white, I don't give a fuck
Even orange shit if I'm stuck somewhere layin' up
But that's a long story for another time
So c'mon Jay, OD em' with some dope rhymes

[Verse 2: Jay Boogie]
I am colder than a freezer and I’m shaking like a seizure
And I’m ripping my t-shirt, bitch take me to your leader
I heard your dealer was cheaper, I am a seeker for the reefer
Make me a believer or I will take you to the cleaners
I don’t want no stems, no shake and I don’t want no beaners
The creature takes a breather of ether just like a steamer
It either gets deeper or weaker for the reaper when he’s asleep because he’s a dreamer
Making you think he is sweeter than a teacher
Then he gets eager to stick his wiener inside of a senior
If she’s a breeder then he gets meaner with each procedure
He’ll demeanor a misdemeanor with streamers then leave them hung up like a receiver
More briefer than Bieber fever
A life lesson learned unless you are a repeater
Didn’t you receive the feature of not to deceive the feeder?
You’re lucky I’m not a woman beater. Cause you’re actin just like a bitch
And faker than Cousin Skeeter

[Verse 3: Dextro]
It's Dextro kickin' back, three MC's smokin like the rock
Jay brings the boogie with the words when we talk
And Venom is the strength, similar to Eddie Brock
And I tick-tock, like the clock, I shape pavement when I rock
With the iron stride, there's no stoppin' me
Freely, I dwell in my own personal head-space
I'm treated like a creep, perverted fuckin' headcase
Because everything I write is similar to dope
If ya break it down, take it, it is similar to coke
No need to tie the rope, my art is suicide
The whole thought is haunting, go out before my time
Just like Hunter S. Thompson
I'll put a bullet in my brain
And the tool is known as a Smith and Wesson
Cause when you're fuckin' with the dopest
This is the lesson
