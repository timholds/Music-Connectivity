Sure do appreciate y'all coming
Especially you Skinny Lizzy

Me and my cousin Frank
He's the one that robbed the bank
Bought some whiskey all can drink
And it's in the barn

You see Ma, she's passed away
And there's not much I can say
'Cept I'd like you all to pray
'Cause I don't know what we're gonna do, Lord help me!

Won't y'all come again
Won't y'all come?
Your faces keep us warm
Won't y'all come?

Pappa sits alone and all he does is moan and moan, moan and moan
So I put on my pin-striped suit
I wouldn't fill my pockets with loot
I went looking for the Reverend Luke way up north in Tennessee

Won't y'all come again
Won't y'all come?
Your faces keep us warm
Won't y'all come?

Ma passed away
Not much I can say
Like you all to pray
I don't know what we're gonna do, Lord help me!
