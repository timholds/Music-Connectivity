[Verse 1: Andrew]
Y'all about to have a problem with it
About to get cooked like the rawest chicken
About to get took like I robbed your business
About to get whooped, and we all can witness
Better call your mama and the obstetrician
Cause I go too raw and I'm far from finished
Got the whole team with us and we all be winning
Yeah, the whole team with us, yeah that's Autumn, innit?
I got the shit I know you want
Take it all, you owe me one
But I'll slice you up like Obi-Wan
If you're acting like you know me, son
I'm gonna eat that right for breakfast now
And when we get back I'll spread it out
Oh, I need that oh so precious sound
And it's almost time to let it out, so

[Chorus]
Let me hear that sound
Let me hear that sound
Let me hear that sound
Cause there's no better time than here and now
Let me hear that sound
Let me hear that sound
If you don't know how it goes by now
I'm gonna do it for you right now: whoop!

[Verse 2: Travis]
Often spotty carbon copy of the mom and poppy
Line of thinking, nothing new or crafted, Hobby Lobby
Cluing you in on what's the trends would be like
Trying to copy terabytes on old and dusted stupid floppies
You ain't got no space
The crew's too threw, let me hear the bass, man
The crew's too threw, let me hear the bass, man
We may not been the first, but we set the pace
Oh whoa, we bring heat, it ain't just seasonal
Oh no, we out here and y'all ain't even know
Think what you want, we got the pudding with proof
Every time you speak, hate what you're putting me through
Every time you act, hate what you're looking to do
And every time you breathe, there ain't much good it can do, no

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Cheldon McQueen]
Long as they twenty-one it's black jack, I don't need no Tropic Thunder
Cause my Benz still iller, please don't tell my baby mama
Pull up on your girl, ask her out to Benihana's
Skrrrrt off, then drip like piranhas
I've been on for a minute now
From the way
With them boy buss shot every day
Trav Scott, know the boy don't play
But you niggas so sus
It done been a minute since a nigga showed up
Steady getting son'd, boy you need to grow up
Instead of showing hate, boy you need to show love, oh
You need to show love
Bout to wrap it up like a pita roll
Make her sing my songs like Anita Baker
I'm just trying to headline Fader Fort
They just say we just so, we just so so good
