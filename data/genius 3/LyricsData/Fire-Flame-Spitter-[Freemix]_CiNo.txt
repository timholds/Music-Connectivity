[Hook] (2x)
Fire flame, f-flame, f-fire flame spitter (2x)
I'm the realest, you don't want no problems (2x)

[Verse]
I'm a fire flame spitter
Get a hydrant gay nigga
You can't fight or scrape with a dragon-dino-ape killer
You can die, get raped quicker than a kid girl, I got your face stitched up
You don't wanna play with the torch, lighter blaze river
I'll run you to a tree trunk
Drag you by the feet, chump
Lay you on the street, use your ass as a speed bump
Whoops! I dont think he gon' make it
I got his bitch in the whip sitting with me naked
She been known that my lyrics are sacred
So she open up and hard is how I let her take it
I'm rawer than a roaring lion
There's no denying
You hoes is lying
I'm dope at rhyming
Like you ain't notice yet
I'll run up to you with a loaded Tec
Blow the set and fold the check
I dont know who's doper yet
Kind of like Royce & Em, either way I'm most in 10's
Hope I'm in like McLovin, but my jeans ain't dick-hugging
What the fuck you thinking bitch?
I'mma dig a deeper ditch
So you cannot breathe and shit
You've been forced to plead the 5th
I'm that crazy CiNo guy
100 ways to see you die
I just hope you realize I just ate you like a pizza slice
