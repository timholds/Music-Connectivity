Da Hol' 9 mo
Time to shine it
2-99 mo

[Verse 1: Kemo]
Like Tony Soprano, lil' derty bedaubing
But instead of tortellini, eatin collard green
Urry time I kick a rhyme, then KemoSaubee mean
Urry time I spit a line, you think its not a thing
Bein the hardest sumthin I can deem
Got the whip to get ya chick up out her Prada jeans
Got the wit to get ya rich up out ya rightest dreams
Got the wit to get ya litchis like a powder fiend
Homeboy you got a lot of cream
Urry time you ride ya Escalade, you gotta lean
Camilin paint, 22's, lot of screens
This a game, don't move, I got the beam
See I been pullin Jacksons from the early team
Back when I was moonwalkin, to "Billy Jean"
So fool take me to the vault and don't cause a scene
Represent for McCall so I gotta scream

[Hook: Kemo - repeat 2X]
URR URR! come herre derty
Lemme holla at cha
URR URR! coem herre derty
Lemme holla at cha
URR URR! come herre derty
Lemme holla at cha
Lemme holla at cha derty
Lemme holla at cha

[Verse 2: Kaos]
I know they one of those, mo they the was vapin
Clearly got the gold eggs and had to get some mo' cuz those was taken
I heard he got them birds for no snakin
Hater show waitin for ya partna to slip and trip
He's got the pros chasin, they on his head kin folk
So don't sleep, he know hes keepin the way silent she go
To keys and then bro, my peoples wanna see ya boy toe tagged
It ain't no joke tell 'em mo, and know 'em make sure that he knows that

[Verse 3: Kemo]
Posted on a corner like a stop sign, blocked 9
Cuz this fool dropped dime, tried to slang Rick a brick
And tried to plot now, somebody chargin' 26 for the block now
Slam, only does a bottle we gon lockdown
Fed shed to shop down but he out now
So I'm about to roll through his spot now
Bust shots and watch fools on his block die
It's much bigger than them iced out necklaces
The Rolexes, it's a price on ya neck ya dig, I'm bout to get it quick
They say my head is sick, I offer readiness
With 32 shots all off in the clip, I never miss
I make 'em Black Casper
I smell cheese, y'all colder than Alaska
You better freeze y'all, put 'em in a casket, make 'em a memory dogg
Hold on wait a minute, I think I see a dogg
