"Smart" - written and performed by Palmer Reed



Asking what’s a pass to a passport

Give a little more than what they ask for

Learn to make a way when I ain’t have one

Had to make a way when I ain’t have one



Now I’m glistening’

OOOH

Paid attention now your listening

OOOH

They working with the plastic wrap

OOOH

I'm working with a duffel bag



Yeah



You done messed up and it’s obvious

Playing the game with no common sense

No time for beef, I’m on a roll

Tell em to catch up, no condiments

Gotta go and give my all again

Gotta go and show them

I do not control them

But I’ll make them listen all the same

From the bottom to the top again



I just wanna say I’ve seen it all here

Talking punctuation marks here

So I had to make a call, yeah

Now I’m MAKKIN’ with the sauce, yeah

And they ask me if I’m ballin

I tell them not at all, man

I’m just hustling like all man

I’m hustling like aww man



Whoah



I’m Asking what’s a pass to a passport

Give a little more than what they ask for

Learn to make a way when I ain’t have one

Had to make a way when I ain’t have one



I’m NASA with the loud, man

Satellites and clouds

Truth is never proud

Open up they mouth

Said they wasn’t bout

But they see me now

Cuz I hold it down

Gravity to ground

Do you get it

Scientist of sound

I’m a Chemist

Orbit back around in a minute

I need another crown, better finish



I’m lifted off the work

Working on the wealth

Wealth is of the mind

Mind the hours i want 10,000

I’m at 9,099

I’m a prime number on my grind

I’mma grind harder every time

I’mma shine brighter every shine

I’m a referee, just with the lines



I just wanna say I’ve seen it all here

Talking punctuation marks here

So i had to make a call yeah

Now I’m MAKKIN’ with the sauce yea

And they ask me if I’m ballin

I tell them not at all man

I’m just hustling like all man

I’m hustling like aww man



Now I’m glistening’
