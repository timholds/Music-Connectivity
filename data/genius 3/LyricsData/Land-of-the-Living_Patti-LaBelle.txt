I got a mirror, a bottle and a pen
The mirror is cracked
The bottle is empty
And my pen don't know where to begin

I've got a picture, a letter and a song, yes, I do
The picture is torn up
The letter is worn
And my tune has been sung before

Another show is over
And the lights have gone down
There's no flowers at my door
No, no callers comin' 'round, no

But I'm glad to be alive sure enough in the land of the living
I can't believe that I survived
Still [Incomprehensible] I'm in the land of the living
Can't believe that I survived

I saw the city, the lights and the music
The city is hard
The lights they have lied
And the music just seems to have died

I had my hope, I had my faith
And my pride, yeah
To hope I cling, to faith I am blind
And my pride I have left far behind

Another show is over
And the lights have gone down
There's no flowers at my door
Ain't no callers comin' 'round, baby

But I'm glad to be alive
Still in the land of the living, baby
I can't believe that I survived
Still in the land of the living

I'm still standing
I'm still standing
I'm still standing
I'm still standing

Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive
Land of the living
Survive
Land of the living

Alive, alive, alive, alive, alive
Land of the living
Survive
Land of the living

Yes, can any stop me?
I believe, yes, I do

I had my hope, I had my faith
And my pride, yeah
To hope I cling, to faith I am blind
And my pride I have left far behind

Well, another show is over
And the lights have gone down
There's no flowers at my door
No, nobody's comin' 'round, baby

Hey stand up, stand up, stand up
Hey stand up, stand up
Hey stand up, stand up
Hey

Nothing can stop me but myself
I'm still feeling my sisters, my mother, my father
But I'm still here, ooh, ooh, don't give up
