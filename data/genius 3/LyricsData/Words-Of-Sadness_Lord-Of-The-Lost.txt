[Strophe 1]
I remember drawing circles
On the floor
This prolonging has haunted
Me since I was born
God it's endless, what's the point
In all this hope
All my days end when
The shadow hits the floor

[Chorus]
I remember all the sadness
That was in my heart till you
First showed it gladness
If I ever said it different
It's cause I opened up my heart
For you to close it

[Strophe 2]
Slipped the water from my eyes
Onto the floor
Let the world out from
My mouth into your soul
Pain in endless, what' the
Point in growing old
Death is pointless
There's your chance to let it go

[Chorus]
I remember words of sadness
Coming from your mouth
Into this place of madness
If I ever told you different
It's cause I opened up my heart
For you to closed it

[Bridge 1]
Denied a god given right
I was denied a god given right
I was denied a god given right
I was denied a god given right
I was denied
I was denied

[Bridge 2]
Denied a god given right
I was denied a god given right
I was denied
I was denied
All of my life I've been waiting for this
All of my life I've been waiting for this
All of my life I've been waiting for this
All of my life I've been waiting for this
