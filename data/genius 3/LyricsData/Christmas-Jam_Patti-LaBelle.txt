And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh, no, no, no

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no

Jut like an old cliche
One that simply says
You can't miss what you never had

I thought that love was just a feeling
That I'd give to him and in return
He'd give it back

But it's more than a friendly sensation
Oh, I had to be tripping out on the girls
Body vibration

But I knew, oh, oh, oh yeah

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oh, no, no, no

I'm so glad, I can stand here today and say

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

Listen to me now
Just like a tender young virgin
In her first love affair
I doubt if she'd ever do it again
Would she even care?

But as time pressed on
Ooh, ooh, the girl caught on
Nothing more she'd do with the boy
She seemed to want it, want it, want it

But there's one side of love
I'd never, never, never known
Baby, until you came along
I can, I can tell the world

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Oh, no, no, no, no, no

Break it down to me easy
'Cause everybody needs some kind
Of love in their life
Some kind of shape, form or fashion

Some kind of shape, form or fashion
Oh, and just like the flowers need the rain
And they need, they need love to grow

I got you, baby
That's all you'll ever need
Chased away the blues in my life
You've got a way of making everything alright

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Somebody, understand me now

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh, no, no, no

When something happen good to you
Seem like you just wanna
Let everybody know, let everybody know

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh, no, no, no

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh, no, no, no, no, no

Love has finally come at last
And I'm never gonna give it back
Ooh, no, no, no
