(Krazy)
Everytime I see your face it
Makes me wanna sing, and
Everytime I think about your
Love it drives me crazy

(Spike-e)
When I see your face I dont
Wanna remember, hating me
It won't last forever, you me
I'll never like another, you
Was the love and I found ya
I wanna be round ya, and
Turn back time, I would
I could, I should get ya back
But life goes on, I'll still go
Strong, I'll wait a while but
Not that long

(Strider)
Take a step back and think
Of the times, when we used
To have fun all alone in the
Dark, just me and you, no-one
Else, love was strong and in
Your heart this damn love is
All gone, but in mine its like
A scar, its never gonna go
Please baby call me I really
Need to know, its driving me
Crazy girl my minds about to
Blow, you're my number one
Girl its all I have to show

(Flava)
How is it now, how it is
Reminisce forget it, I know you
Ain't got time to call or text or
Write or think of me, I think I
Might need you to pick me
Up and put me on my feet for
Real, you dont know this, you
Know how we were, when
We were close to love but it
Unfolded but now the oldest
Memories are golden

(Chorus)
I belong to you (I belong)
I give all my love to you
Everytime I see your face it
Makes me wanna sing and
Everytime I think about your
Love it drives me crazy
I belong to you (I belong)
I give all my love to you
Everytime I see your face it
Makes me wanna sing (I give
You all my love) and everytime
I think about your love it drives
Me crazy

(Kenzie)
Hold up a minute yo wait turn
Back the clock, coz girl I miss
You bad I think about you
Non-stop, how could you
Forget all of those special
Times we were all alone and
You looked so fine
Sometimes I'd just stare look
Up to the sky, wondering if
You were looking up at the
Smae time, oh please you
Know I'd fall down on my
Knees, coz I loved you girl
You was the one for me

(Rocky B)
I'm besotted, coz my brain
Feels so clotted, why you
Wanna hate man coz of what
A mans done, say you wanna
Leave man in da rain, to deal
With the pain, alone because
You're gone, I've gotta face
The black gotta fade away, its
Been seven days, since i've
Seen you last, but now coz you're in my past, a day dont
Go when I dont think of you

(Melo-D)
Did you ever think about
How i'd feel when you was
Walking out the door now
I'm feeling sore, I can't touch
Ya feel ya kiss ya no more
You're not around me or even
In my life no more, now i'll
Never love again coz my
Heart's in shreds, how can
The love be there and all
Of a sudden just turn dead
I thought the love we had
Would be eternally strong
But now I can see that I was
Wrong, coz you're gone

(Repeat Chorus x2)
