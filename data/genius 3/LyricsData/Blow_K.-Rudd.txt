[Verse 1: K. Rudd]
Shit, every day I wake up
I gotta thank the man above
Shit, for all my niggas
I'm here fuckin' hoes and showin' love
Can't forget about the drugs, see what slid under the rug
A nigga hit me on my phone and told me nigga match a thug
So, what I dug?
I roll extendo with my niggas
In a shh, put you on your back like you play limbo with my niggas
In my limo; ain't no niggas, shit
It's just me and some hoes
They gon' do what they want so I do what I'm supposed
Fuck you think you alive for?
These the same niggas that I die for, I ride for
Ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Wouldn't be where I'm at now, shit, if it weren't for my niggas, ah

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Inhale for me
Exhale for me and blow
And blow
Exhale for me and blow
And blow
Exhale for me

[Verse 2: K. Rudd]
Recently niggas frayin' and saying nothin'
I was genes at that pump when that nigga started dumpin'
Back to Cali was bumpin'
But we lost a soldier
And everytime I leave the club, I'm leaving with bitches
That's Oprah, shit, I can't wait till it's over
Can go back to the crib
And I'm ahead and be forgived for all the shit that I did
And I ain't trippin' on nothin'
I'm sippin' on somethin'
And my homeboy say he's got a bad bitch for me tonight
Fuck you think niggas die for?
'Cause niggas wear the same number then they ride more
Die for, ride for my motherfuckin' niggas
Wouldn't be where I'm at now, shit, if it weren't for my niggas, ah

[Chorus: Jesse Rutherford]
Inhale for me
Exhale for me and blow
And blow
Exhale for me and blow
And blow
Exhale for me
