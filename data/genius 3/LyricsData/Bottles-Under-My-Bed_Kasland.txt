[Verse 1]
This right here is a story about a little boy at home
With his mom and grandparents, but no father, he was gone
And an uncle out of state that he would talk to on the phone
Got so excited when he'd visit you could hear it in his tone
And then he moved in with the family, boy's smile was even bigger
He would go to school excited then he couldn't get home quicker
Til one day he heard him yelling and his voice was getting thicker
See his uncle had a problem... It was liquor
Had no clue his uncle's drunk while he was buckled in the van
Went from feeling safe with him to scared and running from the man
His family saw he was afraid, but tell him nothing was the plan
All because the little boy was just too young to understand
He was a hero in his eyes, but a monster when disguised
See he didn't know the problem, he was lost up in the lies
Found some bottles in the closet so he tossed them, he despised
His uncle screaming through the house, he's playing possum as he cries

[Hook]
Emotions bottled up like the liquor in the cabinet
Loved ones let their lives slip away, don't even try to grab it
Yet the people who surround it, we're effected by the habit
Watch the ones we love and care for let the alcohol entrap them
And then change their personalities, start treating people different
Never thought a simple bottle could have so much evil in it
Trying to keep up with the truth, but it's running ahead
I keep the pain and fear inside the bottles under my bed

[Verse 2]
Wait, stay quiet... Ok, he's gone
Shaking full of fear as he'd go running to his mom
Put his hands over his ears, don't want to know what's going on
Cheeks were drenched with all his tears, the fights would always last so long
Looked his uncle in the eyes as he would talk all distorted
He would leave the house, that night there would be a knock at the door and
He was taken to get his uncle at three o'clock in the morning
Just to see he got locked up, this needs to stop, it's important
Cause he cared about his uncle, didn't want to see him like this
So he searched and stole the bottles and he knew that he just might piss
Off his uncle more, but he would fight as long as he could fight this
Alcoholism is more than an addiction, it's a virus
That would tear his family down until it would no longer be
With all the fighting and yelling I'm sure you would all agree
That little boy was hurt and scared, that's what his uncle failed to see
And I know this for a fact, cause that little boy was me

[Hook]
