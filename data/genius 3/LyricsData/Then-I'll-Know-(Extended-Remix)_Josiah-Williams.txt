[Josiah Williams:]
One of these days the sky’s gonna break
And everything escapes
Then I’ll know

One of these days the mountains will fall into the sea
And they’ll know

You and I were made for this
I was made to taste your kiss
We were never meant to fall away

[Genesis Renji:]
My daring Rosetta
There isn’t a stone to translate you
I only wish to understand your foreign commands
And if CTRL+ALT+DEL what I’m believing solves the code I’m seeing
Then let’s reboot
I’m ready to speak French
Let’s derive oui’s from ae’s and ou’s
Let’s do the unspeakable
Our body languages translate in sin
And baby I’m fluent in Babylon

[Genesis Renji – Verse One:]
Every day we wake up
We fall in love to break up
Life is a test and I think we need to make up
You plus I equals chemistry
I study what we made of
Through the pages of ya diary
Show how much you admire me
Doodles in the margin outline how you desire me
But lately
It seems like you’ve been erasing the patience from ya pencil-painted equations
And baby
I been waiting
For an explanation
Of all the missing pages
I know I promised you some privacy
But locked phones and erased messages don’t put my mind at ease
Loving you’s been a battle
And I don’t think this will ever cease
We stay pushing keys like Fur Elise melodies
It’s complicated
But I can’t say that I hate it
Cuz we seem jaded
But destined to make it
The twinkle in ya eye resembles tears from the sky
You ever seen a cloud cry
Storms remind me of you and I

[Chorus:]
One of these days the sky’s gonna break
And everything escapes
Then I’ll know

You and I were made for this
I was made to taste your kiss
We were never meant to fall away


[Josiah Williams - Verse Two:]
I get these voicemails about leaving, subtweets about cheating
Your flight is leaving at 3AM, I’ve yet to understand reasons
Why you’d wanna pick it up and just walk away
(With no effort in, can we solve things?)
We treat this like a marriage; make laps around these dissolved rings
Our burning flame is a flicker and nothing bigger
You grab hold of your words and pull, verbal trigger
Aimed pointed towards my central, took over my system
That ended the case questioned, this is now declared a dictum

What’s saddening is you only show that you’re mad at me
But actually I still see life living in our battery
It’s just in need of a charge, so I’mma take it
If needed then I will pause and break so we can make it
This dedication’s a must, if we’re not living great then adjust
Believe until I die that you and I will be unified, so that’s us (One love)
Being honest, you’re seeing all that I mean
Two beautiful visions, one incredible dream

[Genesis Renji:]
We’re far from picture perfect
But if we let the world frame it
They’ll claim we’re a Kodak moment
I’m unsure if we’ll ever have a full house with family matters
But I know I want this
And I don’t know what this is
But I know I want to do it so right
We’ll remember how neither one of us ever left
I want yesterdays out of tomorrows
Let’s focus on todays (two days)
And then I’ll know
