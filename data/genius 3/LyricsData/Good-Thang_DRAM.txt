[Intro]
Cardo got wings

[Hook]
When you're holdin' on a good thang
And it's good to ya
Don't let go
Don't let go of the good thang
It won't be good for ya
Lose control
When you're holdin' on a good thang
And it's good to ya
Please don't let go
Don't let go of the good thang
It won't be good for ya
Don't let go

[Verse 1]
I'm making plans to commit the world, to grovel at your feet
And I'm sick of saying that no one in this land can mean as much as me
And I'm makin' calls to evolve myself, and strengthening your forte
And I do it all, do it all to brighten up your day
All cause of how you make me feel
Different, but it's me still
Won't do shit alone, but we will build
Us three castles on three hills

[Pre-Hook]
'Cause I love you, I think that you know
I love you, it's starting to show
I trust you, you know it goes
I love you, I won't let you go now

[Hook]
When you're holdin' on a good thang
And it's good to ya
Don't let go
Don't let go of the good thang
It won't be good for ya
Lose control
When you're holdin' on a good thang
And it's good to ya
Please don't let go
Don't let go of the good thang
It won't be good for ya
Don't let go

[Verse 2]
It gets agitating girl, I know you feel the same
We done graduated past all of these kiddie games
Had this one bitch try to do me like she Billlie Jean
Only 'cause we ran through her just like she Penny Lane
I had to tell you 'fore you found out through someone else
You already knew, but still kept it cool, girl, you somethin' else
Let me Facetime that pussy and watch you fuck yourself
I get excited the instant that you unbuckle belt
I'll be back divin' in it about a week or two
'Cause I'm on road and you on road, we keepin' busy, boo
Askin' 21 questions, like it's an interview
Like where you goin'? And what you finna do?

[Pre-Hook]
'Cause I love you, I think that you know
I love you, it's starting to show
I trust you, you know it goes
I love you, I won't let you go now

[Hook]
When you're holdin' on a good thang
And it's good to ya
Don't let go
Don't let go of the good thang
It won't be good for ya
Lose control
When you're holdin' on a good thang
And it's good to ya
Please don't let go
Don't let go of the good thang
It won't be good for ya
Don't let go
