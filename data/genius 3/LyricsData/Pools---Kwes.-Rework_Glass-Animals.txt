We float before the sea at dusk
In heavy mist, in glitter dust
I smile before I want to
I smile because you won't do

We sip the wind through lips of lust
And out it comes, warm wisps of love
I smile because I want to
I smile because you want to

Put the flowers in your hair
Wrap your tendrils round my chest
I smile because I want to
I am your boy

Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I'm a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

Down by the shore, a funny foal
Who bit my wings and ate them whole
You left before I come to
You left before I come to

We took to heels into the trees
I hit my head and bit the leaves
You left before I come to
You left before I

Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I'm a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

Shanks of slate fall to the beach
Wrapped up in life in ultra greens
Pools teem with tiny feet
And whorls of tidal memories

You left before I got to
You left before I got to
You left before I got to
You left before I

Shook the flowers from your hair
Run to me and kiss my hand
I'm dead before I
I'm dead before I

Shake my little soul for you then, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I'm a man of many tricks and tools and joy
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

Shake my little soul for you now, toy
And I settle up into a world of noise
I'm a man of many tricks and tools and toys
With a battery of guilt on which to poise

I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to
I smile because I want to, I smile because I want to
