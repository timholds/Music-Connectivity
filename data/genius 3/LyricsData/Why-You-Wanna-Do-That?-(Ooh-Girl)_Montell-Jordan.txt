1 - Shaking in the club, making it all wet
Sitting on my lap, knowing we just met
Ooh girl, why you wanna go and do that?
(Do what?) Do that, why you wanna do that?

Frontin' in the club, making it all wet
Sitting on my lap, playing hard to get
Ooh girl, why you wanna go and do that?
(Do what?) Do that, why you wanna do that?

She's sexually teasing me, standing too close to me
Whispering things to me just to get my attention
And she's thinking it's just a game
Fake numbers and made up names
Promising freaky things but she's got no intentions

2 - She says she just wanna have fun so
She keeps leading me on
Not knowing I ain't the one
Still she keeps on

Repeat 1

To her, image is everything
And she will do anything
To make the illusion
She is the life of the party
So I'll play along with her scheme
Until she comes near my cream

Watching her every move
Trying to get to my money

Repeat 2

Repeat 1
Repeat 1

Touching me (Why you wanna do that?)
Now you're teasing me (Why you wanna do that?)
Trying to see my watch (Why you wanna do that?)
You wanna see my rings (Why you wanna do that?)
You're all over me (Why you wanna do that?)
Trying to hold my hand (Why you wanna do that?)
Cause we had a dance (Why you wanna do that?)
Girl you don't even know me, no, no

3 - Girl get off me, back up off me
Why you doing that now, that now?
Ooh girl why you wanna go and do that?
(Do what) Do that
Why you wanna do that?

Repeat 3

Repeat 1 till end
