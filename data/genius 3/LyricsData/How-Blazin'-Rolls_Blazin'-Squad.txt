(Chorus:) everything we do is magic, everything we touch is classic, girl we
Always knew we had it and now everybody knows how Blazin rolls!

(Krazy:) we've got something here that really could cause trouble, it really
Just
Occured to me, right now we've got it bad, yes we have, it's going krazy can't
U see

(Flava:) yo yo now I'm ready to get into some serious sh** reach amazing
Heights all over the news that we are bigger than life, it's not what you
Think, American Bling when you were hitting them up! I no you all thought it
Was love but it just happened, & now its all kicking off it just happened, I
Dont know what to say it just happened, so now were licking off shows we're
Just rapping, back in the scene you attack the critics its hard to survive
In this tricky business, from right to richest from richest to drug addicts
And case of misfits its all so twisted, you missed it the point of it gets
Better everything we do come on we're trend setters together we're gonna make a
Creative letter we're getting the girls
Wetter!

(Chorus:)
Everything we do is magic, everything we touch is classic, girl we always
Knew we had it and now everybody knows how Blazin rolls, everything we do is
Magic, everything we touch is classic, girl we always knew that we had it
And now everybody knows how Blazin rolls!

(Krazy:) now you understand this Blazin situation, and you know just how we
Roll, tell me it isn't true, something I lost was you

(Flava:) here we go come on, here we go come on!
Yo Strider

(Strider:) So ha, I think its time that we should sit down, remember the times
When we used to maintain, to clash cru's but now its all about making g's
Travel over sea's drinking cris driving LGGTs now your walking down the
Streets with your platinum chains up this stages girls will be screaming
Your name but its the same its the best thing in fame never change, change
Always looses the game, so when I say jumping jump bounce, all girls are
Blazin its time to wind out, I'll take you to the last round hit it never
Found out of bound, hit hitting with with the brand new sounds where the b l
A z i n s q u a d mc tanned skin green eyes spiked hair thats me, got the
Lyrical tongues and Mr rip

(Chorus:)
Everything we do is magic, everything we touch is classic, girl we always
Knew we had it and now everybody knows how Blazin rolls, everything we do is
Magic, everything we touch is classic, girl we always knew that we had it
And now everybody knows how Blazin rolls!

(Melo-D:) How we're rolling (we're rolling like this) how we're strolling
(we're strolling like that) cause we blew up the songs when we're on attack
You need to stop slow down and take a step back
How we're rolling (we're rolling like this) how we're strolling (we're
Strolling like that) cause we blew up the songs when we're on attack, you
Need to stop slow down and take a step back

(Kenzie:) Your feeling me now, because back in the day we used to dream never
Had our say, never had it our way, I've started
Of the hard way I dont
Blame the lyrics that we busted but only sprayed on tape, but now I spend my
Life this way at a young age, little through the stock, they stand and gaze
As I walk down the street in this never ending maze cause nothing's a blaze
And I tend to amaze here this

(Chorus:)
Everything we do is magic, everything we touch is classic, girl we always
Knew that we had it and now everybody knows how Blazin rolls, everything we do
Is magic, everything we touch is classic
Girl we always knew that we had it
And now everybody knows how Blazin rolls!
