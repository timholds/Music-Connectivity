Sometimes I'm tossed and driven
And sometimes I don't know where to roam
But I've heard of a city called heaven
And I've started to make it my home

Oh soon I'll reach the glory
Where mortals no longer complain
And there's a ship that's coming to take me
And the captain is calling my name

Do you want to be buried with my people, dear
Was the look in his eyes
We can rest our bones side by side
In the dirt of yonder high
It's so fun to see me being me alongside you
That's how I knew the answer dear
To the look I got from you

I had nearly given up dear with all my fantasies
Then you come and crossed my path, and so here we be
And how the hell did I live this long without you by my side
Can I believe it's you I've sensed and sung to all my life
Arms that held me never worked before until I was held by you
With a grip so still and charged, oh cou cou cou

Finally it came around inviting us to play
There's nothing as scary as a divine plan
But I wouldn't have it any other way

The mystery is larger than you and me
And we're drunk on faded heart
But woman, I have a suspicion
You just could be my missing part

But who the hell knows which way
The gods will pull us tomorrow
But honey we're riding up past right now
And fear's only gonna back up in sorrow

Giddy up love whatever is for you
Will never pass you by
You live and die you
And I live and die me
Each day for the rest of this life

'Cause I am a prince
And I am a prince
I am my own salvation
But you are my queen
And you are my king
So live and die beside each other

Do you want to be buried with my people, dear
Was the look in his eyes
We can rest our bones side by side
In the dirt of yonder high
It's so fun to see me being me alongside you
That's how I knew the answer dear
To the look I got from you
We can rest our bones side by side
