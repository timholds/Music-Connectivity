15 seconds on the clock
Bring it down
45 seconds on my watch
'Til you come 'round

Waiting, I'm always waiting here
Feels like I'm runnin' out of time
Waiting, I'm always waiting here
I'm always runnin' out
Runnin' out of time

I'm still waiting
I'm still waiting here
I'm still waiting for you
The sky darkens and the night gets longer
Still waiting for you

It's the end of the story
Yeah you try to avoid it now
It's the end
It's the end of the story
Footsteps washed out by the rain
But never forgotten
