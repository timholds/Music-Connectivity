I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know (I used to know)
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm (I'm), dreaming (dreaming)
Of a white (of a white) Christmas (I've been dreaming of a white Christmas)
With every Christmas card I write
May your days (they be) be merry (merry) and bright (bright)
And may all you Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
