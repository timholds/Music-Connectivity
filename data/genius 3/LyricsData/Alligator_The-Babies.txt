There's no job to pay the rent,
And there's no love to make it better
There's no plans
Whatcha doin' later?
Take my hand, alligator

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is funny
Life's a laugh
Life is lonely
Yeah it's a drag

And what's your name?
How ya doin'?
I like your hair
How do ya do it?
It's not fair that you're taken
And it's unfair that you're spoken for

[Pre-Chorus]

And I don't care
You're not a traitor
I'll take the stairs
And not the elevator

And one day, I'll see you at the top
Our love will never stop

[Chorus]
And I've been under way too long

[Pre-Chorus]

Oh, what a drag!

[Chorus]
