[Intro]
Yeah

[Verse 1: Terrance Moore]
Bumpin' that Vivaldi at Four Seasons in the lobby
She almost walked right by me, when her black dress caught my Versace
I said, "oh, is that Givenchy?"
She said, "Givenchy."
Then we hopped in that black thing
Bumped that Drizzy mix by Ron C
Instant bonding
Perfect timing
So I'm driving
To the Porterhouse at the Time Warner Center
Lord knows I need an angel, I was born a sinner
Took her next door to the school
NYIT
I'm a fool, dropped out after two months
But when I ride clean, watch me

[Hook]
When I seen Givenchy on her
It was love at first sight
And if that loving is right
Knew she'd be mine by the night
I'm a freak, you a freak
Let's get high, let's get weed
When I die, bury me
In Givenchy
Givenchy

[Verse 2]
Take a walk through Central Park
And talk 'til day turns dark
Then we got the car
Took her to the Garden
Showed her where I'm from
Drove through
Brick City
Maplewood
South Orange
In New York you may feel foriegn
But over here, you'll feel normal
Do you hear me model chick?
Popping all these bottles quick
Are you sure you can handle your liquor?
Shorty I'm just fucking with ya
Let's get back to the Four Seasons
Hand the keys to the valet
And hope the bed that we stay in
Witness something so amazing

[Hook]

["Love": Chris Rock]
That's right man

See relationships are hard man

But in order for any relationship to work

Both people have to be on the same page
Both people have to have the same focus

That's right

And we all know what that page is
We all know what that focus is

In order for the relationship to work
Both people gotta have the same focus

And what's that focus?

The focus is all about

HER!

[Sample: Queen Latifah]
Yeah
We gone take this one back around the way
Yeah

[Bridge]
She dressed in that Givenchy
Yeah, she fresh in that Givenchy
Even when she step out that Givenchy
She still fresh, still fresh, still fresh
Yeah

She dressed in that Givenchy
Yeah, she fresh in that Givenchy
Even when she step out that Givenchy
She still fresh, still fresh, still fresh, still fresh
