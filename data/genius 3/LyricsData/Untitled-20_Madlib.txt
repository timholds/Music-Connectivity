[Phil Da Agony]
Shit...
But I ain't fucking with them chitlins
The most I'm a do is chicken, bad food'll have your breath kicking
Try a diet like Russell Simmons
Dating vegetarian vegan women drinking water with lemons
Low sodium salt, no pork on your fork
After meals she take a long walk
And stay away from the ballpark franks, you pulling all that rank
At Whole Foods putting fuel in your tank
That's more muscle for the machine
Brussel sprouts, broccoli and string beans
You get your choice of three greens plus a starch to go with it
Committed to the gym keeping your waistline trim
That put a grin all over my face, when you walk in the place
We had ketchup on Sunset, tomato paste
Chicago Summertime at the taste, no time to waste
We don't waste food on our plate, let the haters hate
Twelve-ounce steak, asparagus tips delicious, got me licking my lips
On some LL Cool J shit
No rib-tips, we take tips from the best chefs like Raekwon
Now pass the Grey Poupon, no MSG, no butter on my popcorn
This ain't a pop song, tell 'em

[Planet Asia]
I'm always meeting them Whole Food headwrap chicks
For real, real talk

[Krondon]
I mean, I don't really care
Ay, ay, I don't even go over to Skeeters house unless I'm hungry, stomach growling
