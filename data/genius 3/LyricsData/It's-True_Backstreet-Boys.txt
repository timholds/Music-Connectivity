[Verse 1]
Even a lover makes a mistake sometimes
Like any other
Fall out and lose his mind
And I'm sorry for the things I did
For your teardrops over words I said
Can you forgive me and open
Your heart once again, oh yeah

[Chorus]
It's true
I mean it
From the bottom of my heart
Yeah, it's true
Without you I would fall apart

[Verse 2]
Whatever happened
I know that I was wrong, oh yes
Can you believe me
Maybe your faith is gone
But I love you and I always will
So I wonder if you want me still
Can you forgive me and open
Your heart once again, oh yeah

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I'd do anything to make it up to you
So please understand
And open your heart once again

[Chorus]
