[Verse 1]
There's a place that's full of danger
Not a good place for good girls
It's a place that's full of strangers
Watching you, wanting you
Who'd have thought
You'd jump on the wild ride with me

[Chorus]
You make me feel like dancing
Down on the riviera
There's a town called saint tropez
Where a girl like you's a
"Pachanguera"
You make me feel like dancing
We'll make it last forever
Let's go away to saint tropez
Cause a girl like you's a
"Pachanguera"

[Verse 2]
We're making love, with just a glance
Un nouvo amor, a new romance
There's a world that sleeps inside you
It's a world of freedom
It's a place
Where every dream you dream
Can come true
Who'd have thought
You'd waken your wild side
Cause you were like a beauty queen
Who'd have thought
Your pandora's box was me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
We're making love, with just a glance
Un nouvo amor, a new romance
You make me laugh
You make me dance
Un nouvo amor, a game of chance
Who'd have thought
You'd walk on the wild side
Cause you were always so pristine
Who'd have thought
You'd jump on the wild ride with me

[Chorus]
You make me feel like dancing
Down on the riviera
There's a town called saint tropez
Where a girl like you's a
"Pachanguera"
You make it feel like real thing
We'll make it last forever
Let's get away to saint tropez
Cause a girl like you's a
"Pachanguera"

[Outro]
We're making love, with just a glance
Un nouvo amor, a new romance
You make me laugh
You make dance
Un nouvo amor, a game of chance
