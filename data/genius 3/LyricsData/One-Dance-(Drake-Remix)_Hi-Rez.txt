[Verse 1: Hi-Rez]
I'm a verbal assassin, a person with burning passion
A serpent who lurking, laughing, disturbing with no compassion
What I be spitting's deadly, they envy but act so friendly
Sipping Henny I'm out this world like a Mercury, no Freddie
Makaveli said it's better to be feared than loved
They're running their mouth behind closed doors but quick to run
I grip the microphone tight like someone gripping a gun
And going toe to toe with me and winning? Slim to none
Meditated in supernovas while holding obscurely boulders
On my shoulders I'm so focused, when I'm stressed you never know it
I'm just doing what I love for a living I'm not focused
On the women or the money I'm just trying to make a difference
And I'm sipping on this shit that got me doing things I shouldn't
Celebrating life, doing everything they said I couldn't
Put your middle fingers up if you never gave a fuck
What a critic or hater thought about you, it's all love

[Verse 2: VI Seconds]
Uh, baby come and roll with the bad man
Wine up on me rude boy, make me a mad man
That's what I'd say if I'd show these hoes in me Polish
But fact is I never love them, might have a moment of silence
Now here's a moment of silence for every pussy I murdered
And good girl that I changed knowing that I would hurt her
I'm a product of chasing love and getting shit
And I got playing with a random dog and getting bit
It's crazy, I didn't mean to slay your hearts
But the moment I looked at an opening I was playing my part
Giving you everything back you bitches ever gave to me
First it was nothing but not that I'm bugging, you bitches chasing me
Bloodclot, now I'm bringing out damage
Speaking my name out of pockets doing the cinnamon challenge
I'm getting my salad, chastity belt don't give a fuck fam
And won't trust a broad till my twenties look like Tubman, damn

[Verse 3: Emilio Rojas]
What's your definition of love? It's what it meant to me
Tolerance and empathy, thinking of her endlessly
Accept flaws but we hoping for a better we
You better be giving a woman a law like a deputy, uh
The way that our living will get in up in them and then we're quitting
Whenever we're getting a veteran instead of us making them enemies
And then we're finishing, na na, na na, na
It wasn't satisfying, I'd rather treat her right than to have a couple crying
Now, and my girl a knockout, Ronda
The type of looks to strike a chord, Honda
Mujer de mala, never asking for nada
Mami love the wine and dance, a bit of bachata
She a little Aaliyah but on that freak shit
So I be rocking that boat till she gets seasick
Cause baby I'm a Latino I'm into pleasing
You see the way we rolling them Rs it's not a secret
