[Verse 1]
Focus?
We didn't even notice
We awake in a place
We can barely recognize
Yeah hypnosis

[Refrain 1]
And you can justify it all
Your back was up against the wall again

[Verse 2]
Shut up, silence
Add a little violence
And offend and pretend and defend and demand my compliance

[Refrain 2]
And you can always justify
The missile trails across the sky again

[Chorus 1]
So what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
Go and look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?

[Verse 3]
Needful
Too many fucking people
You'll have to take care of yourselves
You know I've got my hands full

[Refrain 2]
And you can always justify
The missile trails across the sky again

[Chorus 2]
Oh, what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than?
Hey, look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong inside?
Are you less than?

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 2]
So what are you waiting for?
You got what you asked for
Did it fix what was wrong with you?
Are you less than? (Are you less- Are you less than?)
And look what you gone done
Welcome oblivion
Did it fix what was wrong inside?
Are you less than?
