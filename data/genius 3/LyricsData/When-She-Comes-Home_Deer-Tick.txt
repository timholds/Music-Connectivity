The whole world is wrong today
But you've been gone so long
That I lost count of days
But when you come (when you come) home
I'm gonna tell you how I got along

I'm gonna tell you, gonna tell you
Everything I thought
Emptiness was bought with your plane ticket
Not so much as a kiss goodbye
I don't want to think of the reasons why
I don't wanna think of reasons why

Most things I wanna say
They will go unspoken always
But if you look a little closer in my eye
You will know everything there is to know

You're gonna know, you're gonna know
Everything I thought
Overcome the sloth, got me a ride to New York
And not so much as a reason why
I just want a kiss, a kiss goodbye
I just want a kiss, a kiss goodbye

The whole world is wrong today
But you've been gone so long that I lost count of days
But when you come (when you come) home
I'm gonna tell you how I got along

I'm gonna tell you, gonna tell you
Everything I thought
Emptiness was bought with your plane ticket
And not so much as a reason why
I just want a kiss, a kiss goodbye
I just want a kiss goodbye
