La-Da-Da-Da
La Da Da Da

(Sean Kingston)
Ring ring
Who's calling?
That's my baby girl on the phone (girl on the phone)
She says she needs some space and she wanna leave me alone
But I'm not tripping cos she say that ain't in the wrong
That's just the way life goes
Let me know big girls don't cry
But please let me explain
Let's sit down work things out
Before you go on your way
See I got a lot of things on my mind
And I know you're feeling the same
Cos the situation's out of control

{CHORUS}
(Fergie)
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you

(Sean Kingston)
I'm feeling blue, let's work things out
Cos I don't know what to do

(Fergie)
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life

(Sean Kingston)
That's just the way it has to go

(Fergie)
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

1-2-3-4

(Fergie)
The smell of your skin lingers (lingers) on me now
You're probably on your flight back to your home town (home town)
I need some shelter of my own protection baby (baby)
To be with myself instead of clarity
Peace, Serenity

{CHORUS}
(Fergie)
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
(Sean Kingston)
I'm feeling blue, let's work things out
Cos I don't know what to do
(Fergie)
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life
(Sean Kingston)
That's just the way it has to go
(Fergie)
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry

(Sean Kingston)
What should I do? I'm missing you and I feel so down
Now that you're gone I can't go on this must be the end

{CHORUS}
(Fergie)
I hope you know, I hope you know
That this has nothing to do with you
(Sean Kingston)
I'm feeling blue, let's work things out
Cos I don't know what to do

(Fergie)
And I'm gonna miss you like a child misses their blanket
But I've got to get a move on with my life

(Sean Kingston)
That's just the way it has to go

(Fergie)
And big girls don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
Don't cry
