[Verse 1]
Baby if you want to, I'll take you to Shangri-La and walk up to the shore
You can dance if you want to
Be a rising star, in a distant glow

[Verse 2]
Baby if you want to, I'll take you to Shangri-La, it's the other end of the line
Let me know when you need it
It's a different space, in a different time
