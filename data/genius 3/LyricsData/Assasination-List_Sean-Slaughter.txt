[Verse]
The first day I met Christ, It was all gravy
Thought to myself now that I'm free it on baby
Read my word, went to church, and prayed faithfully
Never would I thought that these demons would be chasing me
It was the fifth month, fourth day of amazing grace
Stepped out the crib to get some air on my face
Just then I seen two fine shorties walking up the block
My jaw dropped, fitted jeans and boots with a sexy bop
Just then I felt a sting, shivers while my body sang
I thought I heard a shot, turned around to see who let it ring
Nothing there shook off the fiendish stare, thon I'm outta here
Went to the corner store to get a juice and gummy bears
Reached for hawaiian punch, that's when I saw that OE (old English)
Ice cold B, I felt another shot swole me
Actually it grazed me, dazed me, but couldn't faze me
Grabbed the snacks, gave him dap, kid I'm sway zee
What's going on, it seems I'm being setup for the fall
Need to cool down so I step to the mall
Straight to the spot, with the Enyce and Sean John
That's when I saw this butta outfit, mad by Phat Farm
In my jeans, pulled out some dollar bills and lent dirt
My pockets was hurt, out the store steps the cash clerk
Now it's just me and the clothes, if I stole the joints no one would know
Just then I heard some clothes rustle
I turned around quick, but the store was vacant
I could've swore I heard some small, tiny footsteps pacing
I'm buggin', somebody's tryin' to snipe and shorten up my life
Make a widow of my wife, get me locked and fly me kites
Serve me dust pies and make me take a bite, stumble up and break the light
Cast me into the perfect night (say what!)
But not me I said, maybe at the lab I'll find peace
I took the back route; make sure no one's behind me
Got to the lab late, it's been a long day, I should pray
But let me check what's on the cable box, Lordy, Lordy
It's after-hours; all I see is skin and hot sex, foul mouths and black techs
On a big breasted actress
Direct hit, well actually a inch from the heart
I start to slip and fall apart, man I worked so hard
Now I'm losing it, caught a fatal shot and some bruising hits
Caught the Bible out my eye, thon, it seems to glow a bit
Lunged with my last bit of strength, for the Holy Sword
Shouted Jesus name, turned around, seen the demon horde
Standing strong, had they gats raised, all in one accord
Cracked open the book, kid, and guess what I saw
I can do all things in Christ
We're more than conquerors when it comes to the fight
Greater is Christ that's in me, than that master imposter
And now weapon ever formed shall prosper, proper
Swung my Sword around like propellers on helicopters
Cuttin' demons down like cops on crime stoppers
Blocked retaliation shots, the Lord is my Rock
My defender and my shield, plus my wounds he healed
After the battle it was me that was victorious
All thanks and praise the Lord God cause he's glorious
Understand, when you get saved you might be facing this
Cause now your number one on the Assassination list (that's serious!}
