Came home somehow I already knew
Here's your opening scene of a movie
Sun was out the old house framed there
In the driveway engine still running
Well I had nothing left to give
I had no one left to call
In the snow thinking about what you told me
I knew I had to get the hell out of there
Not really looking for the cheap kind
Just curtains and a neon sign
That says
Everything
I need everything
Everything I didn't know was mine
At the time
Everything
You could have everything
How can a little bit of nothing
Make all the difference tonight
There's always a time for jumping
And a time for standing still
Then she says
Everything
You need everything
You could have everything
You deserve everything
Everything
Everything
Yeah
Everything
You should have everything
In tge driveway engine still running
By our old house thinking that we might've lost
Everything
We lost everything
Just a little bit of gas left now
For me to get the hell out of here
