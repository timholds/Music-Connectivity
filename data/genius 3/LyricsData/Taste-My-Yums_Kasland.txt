I step in the spot looking fresh so clean
Brand new shoes, shirt, hat, new jeans
Girls look at me like (oh he's so yummy)
They see I got flavors so they all want me
I like the way you lick your lips (can I get some)
I like the way you move your hips (can I get some)
Shawty say she want a taste, ok I'll let you taste my Yums
Shawty say she want a taste, ok I'll let you taste my Yums

[Verse 1]
Fresh up out the box smell the flavor from a mile away
Feast your eyes upon these shoes and let your mouth just salivate
Mouth water up got you craving for these Yums
All these different flavors got you going crazy for these Yums
Shawty say she want a taste
Shawty say she like the Grape
Yeah girl I like it too
Ooh girl I'm liking you
She said she dig my swag, all Yums attire
Sound off the alarm quick cause I'm on fire
Feeling so hot I'm burning down the building
Shawty what you got, tell me how you feeling
It seems to me that every time I blink man I'm paid
Got my girl looking good in the Popping Pink Lemonade
And she likes it when the Jelly Bean Yums on her feet
And I got her calling me so sweet cause honestly

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
Ok you know you like the Sweet Series, Lemon Lime, Bubble Gum
Candy Apple mixed with Lemonade yeah that's double Yum
I'm craving something sweet from talking about these shoes
Girls drop it low, dropping altitudes
I stay fresh, I stay fly
Those are the rules that I stay by
I never break those rules, Yums got my back
Yums on my shirt, Yums on my hat
Hustle every day cause there's money to be made
Scrillionaire swag drop a hundred on a chain
Then cash my paycheck another thirty thousand made
Cruising through Dallas with my dirty south babe
Got my windows rolled down and my speakers turned up
Man my swag is so hot I think it's burned up
Ashes to ashes I'm burning down your city
Girls say I'm too silly... really
