Standing in a dream, weaving thru' the crowded streets leaving you again endlessly
The choir disappears, an' voices in yr heard appear leading you again endlessly
If th' armies of her soul, take you by surprise an' flee leaving you again endlessly
An th' darkships of her eyes surrender t' you suddenly leading you again endlessly
Standing in a street, th' line beneath th' fallin' leaves leading her again endlessly
An' of all th' stars above, only one reminds her of leaving you again endlessly
