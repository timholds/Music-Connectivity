One, two

Oh, I wanna open this hour
And what's our match to play?
But both of us stay on the guard in the same way
And you know, it's just the book I like

All that we knew, just a clue
All that we was just because I've never loved
Now I wanna trigger your heart, hah
There's something else besides a silvery part
Hey, hey

And that's the book I write
I let it go so long
And now the book I write, oh

This is it, I'm gone

All that we are, all we do
All that we are, all we do is here forever
All that we was just because
All that we knew just a clue

I've never loved
This is the book I write
Oh, why'd I let it go so long?
