The sad sun
Is shining down on the day I drove to the cape
And a thing that was slowly dying
The sad sun was taken away

Never had your chance to live
And it's hard to forgive
Never had your chance to love
And it does not happen like this

In heaven, if heaven exists
And we'll never know until the moment we're finished
And the few that care
What have they accomplished right here?

The sad sun
Shining down on the day I drove to the cape
And a still thing was slowly dying
The sad sun was taken away

Oh, the sad sun was telling me that
You'll never see his light again
All rolling around with no skin
And your wrists cut from start to end

And they're laughing
Clouding your head with bad thoughts
But I'm your friend
And the close encounter never happens like this

Never had your chance to live
And it's hard to forgive
Never had your chance to love
And it does not happen like this

In heaven, if heaven exists
And we'll never know until the moment we're finished
And the few that care
What have they accomplished right here?
What have they accomplished right here?

The sad sun
