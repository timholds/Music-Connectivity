[Verse 1]
I put my hands together and pray
God bless the grind
Stunt this hard, they call it death-defying
What the fuck is show and tell?
To the deaf and blind
Never mind, you would never mind
Who’s next in line? Who’s next in line?
Real player, never needed extra time
I pray this life will be forever mine
And pray the real ones never die
Serenades from that money machine, Al Green
Hot boy, 400 degrees, so extreme
Only seen the sun once in a week, no between
Tell her jump off, jump in the sea
I brought a bungee with me
She want to be down, she want to be down
She want to be down, she want to be down
Come into town with one pound at least
Pop pills at sundown, we come down for weeks
Back before I ever copped my first key
I had to sell a couple O’s to cop my first V
I been killing shit, can’t hold back
On my Tiller shit, I think we souls trapped

[Hook]
I put my hands together and pray, god bless the grind
God bless the grind
God bless the grind
And pray the real ones never die
Said I put my hands together and pray, god bless the grind
God bless the grind
God bless the grind
Never mind, you would never mind

[Post-Hook]
God bless, god bless, god bless, bless the grind

[Verse 2]
Lord I’m falling, I just pretend it’s ok
Even the night falls at the end of the day
At the end of the string, you watch the pendulum swing
Hypnotized by the simplest things the money bring
But ain’t shit for free and she ain’t have a gift for me
So right around Christmas Eve she told me pack my shit and leave
Her name was Eve, kissed me gently on the adam’s apple
I cried for weeks on my knees at the tabernacle
Streets cold, monday, feet cold
Designer shoes, never said you got a cheap sole
Running through the darkness, fell into a deep hole
Come and see the freak show, not a single seat sold
If you only knew the hell that we was going through
Not to overdo it but I swear this shit is overdue
A voice told me the gods favor a chosen few
I hope your word like this pistol ‘cause I’ma hold you to it

[Hook]
I put my hands together and pray, god bless the grind
God bless the grind
God bless the grind
And pray the real ones never die
Said I put my hands together and pray, god bless the grind
God bless the grind
God bless the grind
Never mind, you would never mind

[Post-Hook]
God bless, god bless, god bless, bless the grind

[Outro]
Put my hands together and pray, god bless
God bless the grind
Put my hands together and pray, god bless
God bless the grind
Put my hands together and pray, god bless
God bless the grind
Put my hands together and pray, god bless
God bless the grind
