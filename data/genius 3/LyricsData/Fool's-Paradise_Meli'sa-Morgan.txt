I'm taking out this time
To give you a piece of my mind
Who do you think you are?
Maybe one day you'll be a star

But until then, baby, I'm the one who's crazy
'Cause that's the way you make me feel
I don't want no romance
I just want the chance to show you that I'm for real

I never said that I would be your everything
But you know that I love you, baby
And it's gonna be such a shame
When you can start living with it

Fool's paradise, you better think twice
It's not very nice
Fool's paradise, you better think twice
It's not very nice

Bright lights and big cities
Don't go to my baby's head
You know I love you, baby
But you choose this life instead

So just remember what cha momma told you
Before she sent you on your way
She told never ever be too clever
To not see your own mistakes

I'll be here waiting for you
When you come off your trip
And I guess I will always be the one
To bring you back from your busy, busy, baby

Fool's paradise, you better think twice
It's not very nice
Fool's paradise, you better think twice
It's not very nice

I'll be here waiting for you
When you come off your trip
And I guess I will always be the one
To bring you back from your busy, busy, baby
