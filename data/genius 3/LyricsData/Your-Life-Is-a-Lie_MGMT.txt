[Verse 1]
Here’s the deal
Open your eyes
Your life is a lie
Don’t say a word
I’ll tell you why
You’re living a lie
Your life is a lie
But you deny, you ever lied
Wondering why
Bury your life
Count your friends
On your hands
Now look again
They’re not your friends
Hold your breath
Everyone left
No surprise
Living a lie

[Verse 2]
Tell your wife
This is your life
Your life is a lie
This is your wife
Now she knows, she understands
Her life is a lie
Nobody wins
Try not to cry
You’ll survive
On your own (on your own)

[Outro]
Lessons in life
Your life is a lie
Now there’s no time
Wondering why
Where in the world
Is that girl?
He knows it’s alright
To live a life
Waiting to die
Not knowing that
Your life is a lie
Wondering why
Nobody writes
Hollow inside
Periods in light
Fire and ice
Your life is a lie
On your own
One more time
Your life is a lie
On your own, one more time
Your life is a lie
