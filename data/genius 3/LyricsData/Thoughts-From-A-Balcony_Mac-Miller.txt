[Verse 1]
Let me get a one-way ticket, haven't picked a destination
I'm just tryna catch the train before it has to leave the station
Packing no bags, nothing but the clothes on my back
With a Cognac, let me sip it, tryna to relax
Red wine up in my glass plus Filet Mignon
I got a army right up under me, I'm Genghis Khan
Yeah, it's me against the world, I guess I'll take them on
I might stop and see my girl, but I ain't staying long
What if I'm gone, what the fuck you gon' think then?
I told my story, put my life inside this ink pen
Said I'll make it big when, everybody know me
Well, I made it big and, everybody phony
Ha, so could you pour me, I need a cup
No, none of that liquor, mixing purple stuff
I could talk my pain, but would it hurt too much
Go head, judge me, hate cost money, but this love free

[Hook]
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the sky, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
They just dreams, turn 'em to reality
Double-cup of lean, standing on my balcony
Looking at the street, thinking it could all be mine
All we got is memories, so what the fuck is time?
What the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?
I don't know, what the fuck is time? I ask 'em, what the fuck is time?

[Verse 2]
What do you do when you think you could be an icon?
Cause all these people get to screaming with the lights on
Like they just seen a ghost, earn my stripes, zebra coat
Racing to the gate but my flight gone
And now these writers taking shots without a Nikon
But I don't fight though, figure it's a typo
Seems we in some shit now, gonna be alright though
Potion in my sprite, then my night slows... down, down
See, that's exactly what I need
My khaki's filled with cheese, my homie Sap is on the beat
Like it was "Donald Trump," a fucking hit but I just call it luck
They throw it on when I'm walking in the club
Hey, this the Burgh shit, I don't deserve this
Well, I don't think you looking far beyond the surface
Learn quick, now I'm big time
Fill your cup up, and I'mma sip mine
