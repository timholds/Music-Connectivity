[Chorus: John Wic]
Pull up flexin' with my top down
Don't bring your bitch around
We smokin' out the pound (smokin' out the pound)
If I don't know you please don't come around
I got a hundred 'rounds
I might just lay you down (lay your ass down)
Please don't come around me, please don't come around
Please don't come around me, please don't come around
Hundred rounds, chopper I might lay you down
Please don't come around

[Verse 1: John Wic]
I be on some other shit, yeah I be on it nigga
Smokin' backwood after backwood, you can keep the swisher
I hit my ho one time and then I have my main dismiss her
Your bitch is nasty, suckin' dick, you go back home and kiss her
Countin' money, that's the only thing relaxing me
Got nina on my waist so no you can't sit next to me
I found my diamonds swimmin' knee deep in the ocean sea
Cookie crumbles, come back up just like it's groceries
AR, AR-15
I got a hundred hollow tips in this magazine
Shift the gear then smash the gas, I bet I clear the scene
Drop a four inside a Fanta while you drinkin' clean (mud)

[Chorus: John Wic]
Pull up flexin' with my top down
Don't bring your bitch around
We smokin' out the pound (smokin' out the pound)
If I don't know you please don't come around
I got a hundred 'rounds
I might just lay you down (lay your ass down)
Please don't come around me, please don't come around
Please don't come around me, please don't come around
Hundred rounds, chopper I might lay you down
Please don't come around

[Verse 2: Mango Foo]
Please don't come around
I might lay you down
Chopper hold about a hundred rounds
Gun sound like surround sound
Can you hear me now?
I been juggin', trappin' out the pound
Molly rock the size of stone mound
I feed her perkys when she come around
Yeah, yes I'm a dealer
Diamonds dancin', Michael Jackson, they thriller
Nat nat so I skeet on her nipples
I Terio on that pussy, ooh kill 'em
Cappin' hard, ridin' like back with no swishers
Everywhere I go the draco my nigga
Servin' the white, got coca in the Fisker
Sippin' the drank, I think I need a liver
Diamonds on me look like water water
My wrist smash the pot like a Florida Marlin
Don't bring her 'round me if she a foreign
I dick her down, kick her out, early morning
Pop a perky, I feel like I'm soaring
I whip the pot with tornado army
Uzi with coolant, you cannot harm me
Smoke so much cookie, cause global warming

[Chorus: John Wic]
Pull up flexin' with my top down
Don't bring your bitch around
We smokin' out the pound (smokin' out the pound)
If I don't know you please don't come around
I got a hundred 'rounds
I might just lay you down (lay your ass down)
Please don't come around me, please don't come around
Please don't come around me, please don't come around
Hundred rounds, chopper I might lay you down
Please don't come around
