[Chorus 2X]
I'm getting tired of the same catz, making lame trax, saying bang that
It's a shame black, you sure Jesus Christ ordained that
Framed that, said you can nail it up and hang that
Or did you lay back and didn't bother with his name cat

[Verse 1]
Cause the style you spit is suspect
Full color photo on a 20-song project
Every track carefully layed out, but it was played out
Phat, who let the weight out, 80's release date out
Every album track a sixty-one key Casio
You spit like Scott Broscious, think you Joe DiMaggio
Plus the slang you spit was manuscript, man you sllpped
Trying to be the man you writ
Or man you wrote, ya rhymes upsetting the folk
They used to Tone and Poke, you gave 'em Pokemon
Don't smote me mon, cause you ran totally from
The real gift God gave you, to quote the son
But doing housework at the church ain't too popular
Or giving glory to God on ya job while you mopping up
Cause you crave the limelight, human superstar type
Give ya will to God, pray hard and get ya mind right
Ain't trying to cause conflict, kid, you know what the time is
Kids dying in the street and you wanna rhyme this
Shine this; this is how you represent ya heiness
The ruler of the earth and sea, controller of the climate
The judge, jury and the lawyer, with more adventures than Tom Sawyer
Swingin' on catz like Wally Joyner
That ain't WWJD, before you pen a page B
Spit ya rhyme to God son before you even page me
The Word of the Lord, declares that we wielding our swords
Gripping our shields, do battles on these concrete hills
Nevertheless, soldiers for Christ, never retiring
From the valley, to the hill, to the Mountain of Zion 2X
Who livin' righteous, who claiming now to be the wisest
Who talking out they neck, spittin' venom out like geysers
Who really think money is a self-saving solution
Who really like boosting, and satanic saluting
Who's in a relationship, that's really prostitution
Who knows why they loosing, still in coast steady cruising
On a chariot to destruction, who smoke they little loot until it's nothing
Or spend it all steady fronting
For catz you scream you don't care about
Who ready to die, no faith, little doubt, sin ya love to grin about
Run to God when in doubt, who pray to the Lord sippin' a Guinness stout
Really confused and ready to choose
The key to salvation, believe in Christ and that he died for this nation
And rose on the third, my God is mighty, exclamation
I get to the point, no compromising
And stretch my hands up, praising my Lord, ya heiness
For faithfulness and good works, I feel his presence near while the devil works
In the shadows, with poison arrows
And since I'm saved I found this law came to be
The more good I do, there's evil there at the same speed
So I die daily, dead in sin arise in righteousness
Cleansed by Christ the Lambs blood, the world in spite of us
True believers, that's why we steady persecuted
But when the lord comes to judge the world they can elude it
I'm suffering now because I tell the good news
Because I'm not ashamed, because I know Jesus
The one in whom I have believed
And I'm sure he is able to protect what he has trusted me with until that day!
The heavens housing, 144,000
I want to be the next on line, marching for the prize
Clothed in white, politicking with the Israelites
Angels on the four corners of the earth, seal the lords works
Before destruction of the earth, set off by the seven horns
When the last woe is blown through the trump the earth's torn
Like the veil when Christ rose, the dragon and his angels will try to oppose
Now they under our toes
Thanks to Michael and his angel army, bold and holy soldiers
Takin' back what was promised back in the days of Moses
And slay every Hittite, Amorite, Perrizite, Hivite, Jebusite, down to the Canaanites
But you'll never overthrow the foe if you ain't praying
Me and Christ is staying tight, till that day I lay in flight
Shout Hallelujah, for the fall of Babylon
Shout Hallelujah, in one hour ya powers gone
Shout Hallelujah, our Lord God almighty reigns
Shout Hallelujah, most praise to the High King
Galloping on a white horse, his name is faithful and true
He brandishes a double edge sword, for me and you
On his head, many crown his eyes is like the hottest flame
His name is the Word of God, yet nobody know his name
His robe dipped in the blood, the blood that cleanses all the saints
The one who promised no more death, mourning crying and no pain
Get tossed in the lake of fire, here come New Jerusalem
Triple six with the dragon breath is doomed after the second death
Two in the field, one taken one is left
One is life, one is death, choose where you want to rest
On a hot plate, or the glory in the golden gates
Flames and yells or robes and praise, sulfur suites or angels rays

[Chorus] - 2X
