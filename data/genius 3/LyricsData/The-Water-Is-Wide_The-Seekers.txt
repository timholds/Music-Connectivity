The water is wide I can't cross o'er
Nor do I have light wings to fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I

A ship there is and sails the sea
She's loaded deep as deep can be
But not so deep as the love I'm in
And I know not how I sink or swim

When love is young and love is fine
It's like a gen when first it's new
But love grows old and waxes cold
And fades away like the morning dew

The water is wide I can't cross o'er
Nor do I have light wings to fly
Build me a boat that can carry two
And both shall row my love and I
