[Verse 1: Aimee Mann]
Up till now, I lived my life
Drinking beer so slowly, and sometimes wine
No god, air, water or sunshine
And honesty was my only excuse
I took your love and I used it

[Verse 2: Ted Leo]
Up 'til now, my youthful stage
A useless rage, a torn out page, a worn out gauge
A dirty shade, a big charade, a has-been made
And honesty was my only excuse
I took your love and I used it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I never, I never

[Verse 3: Aimee Mann and Ted Leo]
Up 'til now, a path of life
Was fair enough, enough was fair
And always right
Now I know, I see the light
And honesty, oh honesty
I took your love and I abused it

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
