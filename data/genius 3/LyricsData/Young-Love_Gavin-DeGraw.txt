[ Verse:1 ]
There's no need to beg, babe
That's my open pocket
You take the money from me, I can scrounge
Gave me a fever that will not come down
Oh babe, you're the young woman cast aside
Ostracized, left on the sidewalk of my lonely life

[Chorus:]
For the young lovers, taking the hill
One plants a flag while the other is killed
When the wine pours we raise our cups
Young love is sacrifice, young love is tough
Young love is innocent, young love is us

[ Verse 2:]
What did I get into?
Now everything is untrue
Your eyes tell the lies of the lines that you said
Now that I love you, woah I wish we'd never met
Why wait? woman i'm taking risks here that no one dared
And you're scared, scared of the bottom, afraid of the stairs

[Chorus:]
For the young lovers, taking the hill
One plants a flag while the other is killed
When the wine pours we raise our cups
Young love is sacrifice, young love is tough
Young love is innocent, young love is us

[ Pre-Chorus]
Someone... I saw someone
And fell in love with her face
And it scares me to let it go
Still want her even though
I get less than she takes

[Chorus]
For the young lovers, taking the hill
One plants a flag while the other is killed
When the wine pours we raise our cups
Young love is sacrifice, young love is tough
Young love is innocent, young love is us
For the young lovers, taking the hill
One plants a flag while the other is killed
When the wine pours we raise our cups
Young love is sacrifice, young love is tough
Young love is innocent, young love is us
