I got sixteen speakers and a cellular phone
You can call me I'll be driving alone
I got lots of volume
I got lots and lots of tone
I'm on my way home I should be on my way out
I'm kind of restless I know what it's all about
I gotta get up but I can't fly
I gotta stop all my wondering why

Thinking about my life in the groove
The depth of the groove I followed the groove
My life in the groove the depth of the groove
Always the groove

Something I don't know what
Just made me feel to sick
In search of the groove I listened to a lot of music
But I don't know if it can be found
Of course I won't stop I'll look around

And I still know how to ollie
Into a backside air
I know how to get higher and how not to care about
Boys and girls together
And boys and girls alone
Boys and girls together
And boys and girls alone

I'm thinking about my life in the groove
The depth of the groove
Always the groove
My life in the groove the depth of the groove
And I followed the groove
