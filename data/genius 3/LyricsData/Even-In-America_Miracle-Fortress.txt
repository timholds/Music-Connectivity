Hey
Even in America
Canyon of the dead you can get air

Tampering with the evidence
Burning through your dead presidents

Excuse me while I kiss the sky
Sucking dollars through the satellites

Even in America
Canyon of the dead

My heart was cold
My body was ice
But my mind caught fire
When I touched the wire

Hey
Even in America
Colder looking down
I am always by your side
Sunset and an alibi
Yeah I fight for the small fry

Hey
Even in America
Canyon of the dead you can get air
Colder looking down you can call a friend
