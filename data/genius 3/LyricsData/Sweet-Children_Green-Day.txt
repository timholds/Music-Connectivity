Sweet young girl so soft and blonde
Does exactly what she's been warned
Intoxications in her veins
Sweet young boy plays with her brain

Believing all his faith through lies
Putting his hand on her thigh
Impurity has now been gripped
He takes away her innocence

Sweet children, sweet children, sweet children Remember when?

Johnny Ray is running again
As he hits the floor again
Running from the light of day
Or maybe lie and celebrate

The slightest urge goes from his hand
Follow me if you understand
He's got the trigger on his gun
The final sin and now he runs

Sweet children, sweet children, sweet children Remember when?
Sweet children, sweet children, sweet children Remember when?
