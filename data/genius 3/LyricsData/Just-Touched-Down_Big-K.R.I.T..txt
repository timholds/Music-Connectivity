[Intro:]
Let's get it shawty
This for all my real players (yeah)
Sounds so soulful, don't you agree? (ay what the business here?)
So what I want'chu to do
If you on your way and you bout to do it big
You can tell em shawty...

[Hook:]
I just touched down (touched down)
Aye what it is shawty (yeah)
I'm going places shawty

Aye what it is shawty (yeah)

Aye what it is shawty (yeah)

I just touched down
Just-just j-just-just j-just down
I just-just j-just-just j-just...

[Verse 1:]
I just touched down in my city on chrome
Working wood wheel from a yella gettin' dome
Gators on my toes, love how I'm livin'
Aye tell me what I'm doing if I ain't fuckin' pimpin'
Gettin' money working overtime supernova shine
Wanna see a playa down and out
Ain't no clonin' mine
I'm one of a kind, colder though, make em hear the flo'
See do what I like been doing this since 2005
This ain't overnight
Show ya right, super duper tight, showing bumpa grill
Poppin' trunk, roll it smoke it up, crackin' hella seals
How it feel neva' eva' fuckin with my level
They be trying but no one can do it better

[Hook]

[Verse 2:]
I just got paid, working on a slab
When y'all was watching cartoons I was peeping Shafts
Acting bad, swangin' lane to lane, drippin candy paint
Ain't no ho this side of the Mississippi resist my candy thang
Fly without a plane
Debonair, throw without a care, hoes, they stop and stare
Toot it up triple boot it up, pop 'n lock it there
Drop it there, rock it there, I'm a motivator
Haters best keep walking if it ain't about paper
I'm trill, down like Four Flat
Tires on the cut-throat, SS, or a Cadillac
See they might of slither on the syrup I'be been sippin
Came out my momma's womb breathing life into this pimpin'

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
You dealing with a country fly, certified country flow
M-I-crooked letter, the Return of 4eva ho
Super duper clean on the scene pop my collar back
Prada hella-fied when I'm round like selling power pats
K.R.I.T. P.I.M.P. owe you where my dollas at?
You ain't bout this vison that I'm kicking then don't holla back
Pimpin' is my child, stretching out for miles
Street and block approved on my whole professional

[Hook]
