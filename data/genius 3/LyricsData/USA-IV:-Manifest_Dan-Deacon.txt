NOTHING LIVES LONG
ONLY THE EARTH AND THE MOUNTAINS

I SEE THE HILLSIDES
BURNING IN FLAMES
EVERYTHING'S GRAY
NOTHING REMAINS OF
PLACES I LOVED
NOTHING'S GREEN NOTHING GROWS
EVERYTHING BURNED
EVERYTHING WAS

LEAVE THE LIGHT ON FOR ME I'M COMING HOME
HELL IF I KNOW PLACES I SHOULDN'T ROAM
THINGS THAT I LOVE FADE OUT PAST MY VIEW
THE TIMES ARE RACING NOW I'M JUST GLAD I SPENT THEM WITH YOU

FEEL LIKE I'M ALL FLESH AND NO BONE
I'M NOT THE SHAPES THAT I'M SHOWN
HOPE I GET IT RIGHT TOMORROW
