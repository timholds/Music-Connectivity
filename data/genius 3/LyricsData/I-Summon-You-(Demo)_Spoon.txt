Remember the weight of the world
It's a sound that you used to buy
On cassette and 45
But now you got a girl
She says, "will we make it at all? 800 miles is a drive"

Yeah, you got the weight of the world
Coming down like a mother's eye
And all that you can
All that you can give is a cold goodbye

The law enforcement's impressed
You've survived to this age
Strapped-up soldiers, they'll lock you in a cage without a goodbye
For a nickel bribe

But aww no, you're so far away, oh
And how'd we get here
It's too late to break it off
I need a release, the signal's a cough
But that don't get me off
I summon you to appear my love

The signal's a cough
I summon you here my love

Remember the weight of the world
It's a sound that we used to buy
But now all you can
All that you can give is a cold goodbye
The law enforcement's impressed
You've survived to this age
Your life is a folder
And turn the other page, is all a line
Just to know you're lying

But aww no, not another goodbye
And how'd we get here, it's too late to break it off
I need a release, the signal's a cough
But that don't get me off
I summon you to appear my love

Got the weight of the world
I summon you here my love
The signal's a cough but that don't get me off
I summon you here my love
