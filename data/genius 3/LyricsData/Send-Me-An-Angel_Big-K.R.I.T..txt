[Hook:] x3
When I got no one left
If I need yo help
I can't do it myself
When I got no one left
(Will you Send me an angel)


[Bridge:]
While I'm gettin this money
Out at the club stuntin
I heard them jackers comin
(Will you Send me an angel)
I get my earn for mo'
When I'm at my lowest low
Say if I go to war
(will you send me an angel)
Lord Just watch over mine
As I lay it down
Get to it one more time

[Verse 1:]
Our Father I promise I'mma straighten up
When my family can say that they done ate enough
When my pockets is full and I ain't scrape enough
And these mother fucking laws ain't out chasing us
And my bills ain't due because I paid em up
And all that anger as a youngster I ain't savin up
AK'ed it up red line traded up (300)!
If you ask me these haters ain't hate enough

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]

[Verse 2:]
Our Father I promise I'mma shake em off
When that G5 Jet start taking off
And these hoes after shows I'mma wave em off
When I'm married but for now I'mma break em off
Yeah its hard to see its a part of me
Blood line of a king yea I'm royalty
I get more of me and tell em I'm ready
Well I'm waiting on this angel, throw wings on my Chevy
