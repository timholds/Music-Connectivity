I got 2 chains
Around my neck
One from the fools and
One from government
They say it's a DRUG
Then I start a rant
Call it what it is
It's just a blessed PLANT
Burn me with your game
I burn you with the proof
Smoke each other all year round
But I still be taking poofs
You can play your drug game
Stealing under Gods steeple
I'll fire one up with a friend
Gods gift,a gathering of people 

Government is a thorn around WE
Trying to call it a drug
When it's grown from GODS seed
Call it Maryjane, ganja if you please
We down on earth call it weed
You act so damned smug..
It's the manmade shit
That's emboldens the thugs
When we're in the paper
Arrested ,fined, then judged
You start taking smiling taking
Selfies and snapshots... WITH US???
NOW, now, now, Nancy
Grace is all I ask
Examine this drug or plant dilemma
Or is that too tough a task?
