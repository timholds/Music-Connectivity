Somedayz I'm in the streets
Somedayz I can't sleep
Somedayz I don't eat
My girl trippin' on this rap shit like it ain't happenin'
Somedayz I want to but don't cheat

Somedayz I'm like, "Come through"
Somedayz I don't trust you
Somedayz I don't hustle
You had a good day, and now you type bougie
Somedayz I'm like, "Fuck you"

Somedayz it's alright
Somedayz it was so nice
Somedayz it was long nights
Cause somebody called my phone and they didn't say nothin'
Somedayz it was all fight

But somedayz I was trippin'
Somedayz I didn't listen
Somedayz I went missin'
When you needed me more than you ever, ever needed me
Hope some day you forgive me

Somedayz I act cool
Somedayz I'm that dude
Somedayz I don't choose
Between working all night in the studio with the groupie hoes
Somedayz it's just you

Somedayz I feel pain
Somedayz I like rain
Somedayz I hate fame
When a deal come around and the checks don't bounce
I'm scared someday I might change

Someday you might tease
Somedayz I won't see
Somedayz you throw keys
To the house that I bought cause I thought it'd make you happy
Someday you might leave

Somedayz I'm a healer
Somedayz I'm a dealer
Somedayz I'm a killer
White woman lock her car doors when I pass by
Damn, somedayz I'm a nigga

Somedayz you my homie
Somedayz you seem phony
Somedayz you don't know me
Claim you down for the cause and you ride for your dogs
Somedayz you don't show it

Somedayz I'm broke
Somedayz I have hope
Somedayz I can't cope
When the stress come around, I pour up some brown
Somedayz I just smoke

Somedayz I ain't safe
Somedayz I'm gonna pay
Somedayz I just pray
Will I go to heaven or hell, only god knows
Somedayz I can't say

Somedayz I might lie
Somedayz I don't try
Somedayz I might cry
When I'm on my sick bed and my dayz drawin' short
Damn, someday I'm gonna die

Somedayz...
